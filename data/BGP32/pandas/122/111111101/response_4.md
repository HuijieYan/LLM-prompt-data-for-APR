### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by iterating over their blocks and checking equality between corresponding blocks. The bug arises because during this comparison, the order of blocks from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may not match even if the blocks themselves are equal. This discrepancy leads to the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is consistent before comparing them. One approach is to sort the blocks based on a canonical representation that considers the block's data type (`dtype`) and location within the `BlockManager` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the blocks are sorted based on their data type and location, ensuring consistent block order between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` for an accurate comparison. This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
