### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the reordering of blocks before comparisons. The function is trying to sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. However, the sorting mechanism is incorrect due to comparing the manager locations using the `.tolist()` function which converts the manager locations to a regular Python list, hence losing the BlockPlacement type information.

This incorrect comparison causes the assertion failure. The function tries to sort blocks based on dtype and location but loses the actual block structure needed for comparison, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the BlockPlacement object with the correct location information is preserved during the sorting process. One way to achieve this is by modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the BlockPlacement object directly without conversion to a list. 

### Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly using `block.mgr_locs` instead of converting it to a list, we preserve the BlockPlacement object's structure, allowing for correct comparison of blocks and resolving the bug.
