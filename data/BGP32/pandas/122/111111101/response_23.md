### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables. The comparison is done using the `equals` method between corresponding blocks, but the way blocks are being sorted and compared might lead to incorrect results. The bug is triggered when comparing DataFrames with different block orderings.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks in a consistent way that guarantees correct comparison between `self` and `other` DataFrames. We can achieve this by canonicalizing the blocks based on their data type name and `mgr_locs`. By using this canonicalization method, we can ensure that blocks are sorted in a predictable order that allows for correct comparison between DataFrame blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the combination of data type name and `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that the comparison between blocks within different DataFrames is done in a consistent and correct manner.
