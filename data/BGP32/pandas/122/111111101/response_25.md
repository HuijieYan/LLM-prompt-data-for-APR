The issue in the buggy function is related to how the blocks are being compared for equality. The function tries to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects by sorting them using a custom key in the `canonicalize` function. The bug seems to arise from the implementation of the `canonicalize` function, which causes incorrect sorting and comparison of the blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function generates a consistent and unique key for each block. One approach could be to include more information about the block in the key to distinguish between blocks more accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function properly sorts the blocks based on their type and values, ensuring a consistent and accurate comparison between the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

After applying this fix, the failing test should pass successfully.
