### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks in a non-canonical order. The function first sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function that combines the dtype name and the locations array of the blocks. However, when comparing the blocks, it directly references the blocks from the sorted lists which may not correspond to the correct order.

The error occurs due to comparing blocks based on the order defined by `canonicalize` but then comparing the blocks without considering this order. This leads to incorrect comparisons and the function failing the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in the same order that they were sorted in. This can be achieved by storing the sorted blocks and then comparing them element-wise.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared in the correct order based on the sorting defined by the `canonicalize` function. This fix will resolve the comparison issue and make the `equals` function work correctly.
