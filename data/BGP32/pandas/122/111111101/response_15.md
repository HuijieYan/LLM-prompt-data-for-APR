The bug in the `equals` function is caused by the way blocks are compared between the two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison relies on sorting the blocks based on a canonicalization function that includes the block's data type and manager locations (mgr_locs). 

The bug arises because when sorting the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists, the comparison does not correctly consider the `mgr_locs` attribute. This results in a false comparison even when the block data and structure are the same.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is correctly compared when sorting the blocks. Additionally, we need to check for equality based on the block data and properties, including `dtype`.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())  # Include mgr_locs in canonicalization
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances, including the `mgr_locs` attribute, ensuring a proper comparison and fixing the bug.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` and fulfill the expected input/output values.
