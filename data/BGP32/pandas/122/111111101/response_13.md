The bug in the `equals` function lies in the comparison logic of the blocks. The function fails to properly compare the blocks between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` due to the sorting method using `canonicalize`.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to compare blocks based on a combination of block type and block label.
2. Update the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to use the modified `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype, type name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name, type(block).__name())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function uses a more comprehensive method to compare the blocks between `self` and `other` by considering the block type, dtype, and mgr_locs together while sorting. This approach ensures a proper comparison and should resolve the failing test case.
