### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, there is a bug in the comparison logic due to the sorting of blocks. The bug causes the function to return `False` even when the two `BlockManager` instances should be considered equal.

The issue arises in the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a custom key function `canonicalize`. The `canonicalize` function creates a tuple combining the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The bug occurs because `mgr_locs` is converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`, which results in non-deterministic sorting due to the representation of the mutable list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should create a tuple based on the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` directly without converting it to a list. This will ensure consistent sorting of blocks for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to use the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs` directly, the sorting will be consistent, and the comparison of blocks will be accurate. This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
