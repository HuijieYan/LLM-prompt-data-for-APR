### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within `BlockManager`. The function sorts the blocks and then attempts to check if each block equals the corresponding block in another `BlockManager`. The issue lies in how the `canonicalize` function is handling the block comparison. It sorts the blocks using a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the comparison logic within `canonicalize` itself is flawed. It mistakenly tries to convert `mgr_locs` to a list, which results in an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly compare the blocks by considering all attributes that make a block unique within a `BlockManager`. We should avoid converting `mgr_locs` to a list and compare it as is. 

### Corrected Code
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now properly compare blocks based on their dtype and `mgr_locs`, allowing the function to pass the failing test case.
