The bug in the `equals` function is likely related to how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality. The issue seems to be that the order of the blocks might not be consistent when comparing `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This can lead to the `equals` check failing erroneously.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the index of the block along with the dtype name and mgr_locs. This will provide a more deterministic way of sorting the blocks and ensure they are compared correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block, index):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), index)

    self_blocks = sorted([(block, index) for index, block in enumerate(self.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))
    other_blocks = sorted([(block, index) for index, block in enumerate(other.blocks)], key=lambda x: canonicalize(x[0], x[1]))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for (block, _), (oblock, _) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted consistently based on not only the dtype name and mgr_locs but also the index of each block. This should address the issue causing the failing test and make the `equals` function work as expected.
