### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. The issue lies within the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts these blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function before comparing them. However, the equality comparison of the blocks (`block.equals(oblock)`) might fail due to different block orders, especially when the blocks consist of mixed data types like integers and objects.

### Bug Explanation
1. The buggy function fails when comparing two instances of `BlockManager` due to the inconsistent order of the blocks.
2. The failure occurs because the function sorts the blocks before comparison based on their data type and their memory locations, which isn't a reliable way to determine equality.
3. The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` compares two dataframes with different data types but in a structure where the order of comparison affects the equality result.
4. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` fails, which stems from the incorrect comparison result due to the inconsistent block order.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison approach of the blocks within the `equals` function. Instead of relying on sorting blocks based on data type and memory locations, we can compare the blocks directly without altering their order. This change should ensure that the equality check is consistent and robust.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

By directly comparing blocks without sorting them, we ensure that the equality check between two `BlockManager` instances is performed consistently and based on their original structure. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and provide the expected output.
