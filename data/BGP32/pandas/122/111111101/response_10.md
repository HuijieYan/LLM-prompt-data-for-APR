### Bug Explanation
The buggy `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. The bug arises because the function is not handling the comparison of blocks correctly due to unconsolidated blocks. When comparing the blocks, the function fails to consider blocks that may have different data types but are still equal in content.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to account for unconsolidated blocks that have the same content but different data types. We can achieve this by considering the block content for comparison rather than just the data type. Additionally, we should ensure that both `BlockManager` instances are consolidated before performing comparisons.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.as_array.tostring(), block.shape)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now compare the blocks based on the content rather than just the data type, ensuring a correct comparison even for unconsolidated blocks with the same content. This should resolve the failing test case.
