The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The current implementation compares blocks based on their dtype name and location, which leads to the mismatch in the test case provided.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the comparison logic to ensure that the blocks themselves are compared correctly regardless of their location.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that each block in `self.blocks` is compared with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` using the `equals` method, ensuring a correct comparison. This modification will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the function compliant with the expected behavior.
