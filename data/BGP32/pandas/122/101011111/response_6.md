To address the bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, we need to correct the comparison logic when comparing the blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks with the same content but different memory locations, causing the comparison to wrongly return `True`. To fix this, we can modify the comparison approach to consider the content of the blocks rather than just comparing them directly.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the `block.values.tobytes()` method to convert the block content to bytes for comparison. This approach ensures that even if blocks are at different memory locations but have the same content, they will still be considered equal.

By making this change, the `equals` function will now correctly handle cases where identical blocks exist at different memory locations, leading to a more accurate comparison and resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
