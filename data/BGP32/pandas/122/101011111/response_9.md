### Bug Analysis:
In the provided buggy function, the issue arises when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The function fails to correctly compare identical blocks with different locations, leading to incorrect results.

- The function accesses `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, which contain the block objects representing data in the DataFrame.
- It then sorts these blocks based on a canonicalization function, which combines the type name and the location of the blocks.
- Finally, it compares the sorted blocks from `self` and `other`.

The bug occurs because the block order is based solely on the canonicalization function, without considering the actual data contained in the blocks. This leads to cases where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and ensure that the `equals` method correctly compares DataFrames, the sorting of blocks should be based on the block data itself rather than just the type and location. This change will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.tostring())
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is modified to sort the blocks based on their values rather than just the type name and location. This change ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly compared, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
