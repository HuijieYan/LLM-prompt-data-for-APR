Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is causing the assertion error in the failing test case where it is expected that `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False`, but it incorrectly returns `True`.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic within the `equals` method. The method incorrectly checks for the equality of block contents without considering their locations. This results in a false positive when the blocks have the same data but different locations. The comparison should take into account the locations of the blocks to provide a correct result.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic inside the `equals` method to consider not only the block content but also their locations. By sorting the blocks based on both type and locations, we can ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize_block(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.__hash__())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_block)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version:
- The `canonicalize` function now considers both the type name and the hash of the block locations for sorting.
- This ensures that the blocks are compared correctly based on their content and location.
- With this correction, the `equals` method should provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test case.

After applying this correction and running the failing test case, it should now return `False` as expected.
