### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects to determine if they are equal. The comparison involves checking the axes, blocks, and their internal structures. The failing test case involves comparing two DataFrames with the `equals()` method, which internally calls the `equals()` method of BlockManager. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Error Cause
The bug is likely caused by the ordering of blocks in the sorted lists `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The incorrect behavior occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not considering the correct criteria for equality. The order of blocks may be different due to differences in block locations, leading to an incorrect comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block content for sorting. This modification should ensure that identical blocks with different locations are still recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other class methods here

    def equals(self, other):
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.get_values(), block.dtype.name)
    
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now captures the block content along with the data type, ensuring that blocks are correctly sorted for comparison. This correction should resolve the issue identified in the failing test case and the corresponding GitHub issue.
