Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals()` function arises due to the comparison of blocks that have the same content but different locations. The comparison fails to consider the locations of the blocks, leading to an incorrect result. To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider both the content and locations of the blocks during the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now takes into account the locations of the blocks by using `mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()`. This ensures that two blocks with the same content but different locations are not considered equal. By updating the comparison logic, the function will now correctly handle the comparison of blocks with identical content but different locations, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
