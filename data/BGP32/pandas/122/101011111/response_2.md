### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises because the function incorrectly compares the blocks in different locations as equal when they should not be. This results in the function returning `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks takes their locations into account. One way to achieve this is to compare the blocks based on their content rather than just their types.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_sorted_blocks = []
    other_sorted_blocks = []
    
    for block in self.blocks:
        self_sorted_blocks.append(
            (block.values, block.items)
        )
    
    for block in other.blocks:
        other_sorted_blocks.append(
            (block.values, block.items)
        )
    
    return self_sorted_blocks == other_sorted_blocks
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison is done based on the block values rather than just their types. It should now correctly handle cases where blocks are identical but located differently.
