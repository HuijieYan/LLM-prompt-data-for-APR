The issue in the buggy function arises due to the comparison of blocks with different locations which should still be considered equal. To fix this, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to handle blocks with different locations correctly so that identical blocks, regardless of their location, will be treated as equal during the comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.values))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `canonicalize` function now considers the block values along with the type name for equality comparison. This change ensures that the blocks with different locations but identical values will be correctly recognized as equal during the comparison.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values described in the initial analysis.
