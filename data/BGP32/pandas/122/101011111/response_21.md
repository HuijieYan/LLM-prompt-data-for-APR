After analyzing the buggy function and the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison of blocks with different locations. The function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should return `False` due to the blocks having different locations.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations along with the type name. By including the block locations in the sorting process, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the block locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the function should now properly compare blocks based on both type name and block locations, preventing the erroneous `True` return in cases of identical blocks with different locations.

This corrected version should successfully pass the failing test provided and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
