### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `BlockManager.equals` is comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances based on their order, which leads to incorrect results. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on their data type and memory location but fails to consider the actual data present in the blocks. This leads to `equals` mistakenly returning `True` even when the blocks have different data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare the actual data within the blocks instead of relying on their order based on data type and memory location.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for sb, ob in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not sb.equals(ob):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By directly comparing the data in each block, the corrected function ensures that the `equals` method accurately determines whether two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their content.
