The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison method `equals` incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `equals` compares the axes of two BlockManager objects (`self` and `other`) and then goes on to compare the blocks within them. If the number of blocks or the content within them differs between `self` and `other`, the function should return `False`.
2. The comparison of blocks fails when the blocks are identical but have different locations, leading to the incorrect `True` return.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison of blocks to account for scenarios where the blocks are equal in content but differ in locations. One solution is to iterate over the blocks and compare them based on content.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks_sorted = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        for oblock in other.blocks:
            if block.equals(oblock):
                self_blocks_sorted.append(block)
                other.blocks.remove(oblock)
                break
                
    return len(self.blocks) == len(self_blocks_sorted)
```

By iterating over the blocks and comparing them based on content rather than order, the corrected function should address the bug and return appropriately in cases where blocks are equal but have different locations. This solution aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the GitHub issue.
