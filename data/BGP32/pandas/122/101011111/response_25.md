The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class from `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to a test failure.

### Bug Cause Analysis:
1. The `equals` method compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes, number of blocks, and the equality of each block.
2. The bug arises when comparing identical blocks with different locations due to not handling the block locations properly.
3. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on type and locations but does not account for blocks with identical content but different positions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider both block type and content, ensuring consistent ordering of identical blocks with different locations.
2. Modify the comparison logic to check for equality using a more robust approach that incorporates the new sorting mechanism.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (repr(block), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With these modifications, the `equals` method should now handle identical blocks with different locations correctly, satisfying the failing test case and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
