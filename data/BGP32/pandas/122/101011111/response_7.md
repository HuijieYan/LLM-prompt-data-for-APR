Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue arises due to the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class. The comparison of blocks is done based on the order defined inside the `canonicalize` function. If the blocks have the same data but different locations (mgr_locs), they are considered different due to the sorting in the `canonicalize` function.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider blocks equal if they have the same data, even if their locations (mgr_locs) are different.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions here...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Updated canonicalize function to consider blocks equal if data is the same
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

With this change, we ensure that blocks are considered equal if they have the same data, regardless of their locations. This should fix the bug and make the `equals` function return the correct result for the failing test case provided.
