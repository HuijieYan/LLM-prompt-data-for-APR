### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing DataFrames with different block locations but with the same content. The buggy function fails to correctly compare blocks if they have similar content but are placed differently.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the comparison process takes into account the block locations of each block. By considering the block locations in addition to the content during the comparison, we can accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function that considers block locations during the comparison:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) and (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() == oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version considers both the values and the locations of the blocks during the comparison, ensuring that DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations are correctly identified as not equal.

By implementing this corrected `equals` function, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved, and the failing test case should now pass successfully.
