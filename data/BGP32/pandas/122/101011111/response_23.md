### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug occurs because the `equals` function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The bug causes the function to return `True` instead of `False` when the blocks have identical values but different locations.

To fix the bug:
1. Sort the blocks within both the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Then, compare the sorted blocks to ensure their equality.
3. If all the sorted blocks are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly identify cases where the blocks are equal in value but have different locations, returning `False` as expected.
