Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to stem from the way blocks are compared. The bug causes the function to return `True` incorrectly in cases where blocks have identical content but different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function is based on the content of the blocks rather than their locations. We can achieve this by modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the values within the blocks for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now the `equals` function compares blocks based on their values rather than their locations, which should resolve the bug and make the function return the correct result in cases where blocks have identical content.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, where the `equals` function should return `False` when comparing DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
