The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not correctly comparing two DataFrames for equality. The issue arises when checking for identical blocks with different locations, which leads to incorrect results.

### Analysis:
1. The function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
2. The failure message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when the DataFrames are not equal.
3. The comparison logic seems to be correct, but the issue might arise from how the blocks are sorted and compared.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the blocks in `self` and `other` DataFrames are sorted based on a canonical property before comparison.
2. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, compare the sorted blocks to handle blocks with different locations but the same data.
3. Modify the comparison logic to consider block locations when determining equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Consolidate blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order based on type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing the changes outlined above in the corrected version of the `equals` function, the bug causing incorrect equality comparisons should be resolved.
