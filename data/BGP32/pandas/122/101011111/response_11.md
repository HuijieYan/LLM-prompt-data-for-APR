To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to address the issue where the function incorrectly returns `True` when the DataFrames have identical blocks with different locations. This discrepancy causes failing tests like the one provided.

The problem originates from the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The `canonicalize` function only takes into account the block's data type and location, not the actual data values. As a result, when sorting blocks for comparison, DataFrame blocks with identical values but different locations can be considered unequal.

To solve this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block data values to ensure that blocks with identical content are correctly identified as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to include block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values,  # Include block values for comparison
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This version of the function includes the block values in the `canonicalize` function. By considering the values during sorting, the function now correctly identifies DataFrames with identical data but different block locations as equal.

After implementing this fix, the failing test provided should now pass without any issues.
