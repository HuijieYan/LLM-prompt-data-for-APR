### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class, and it is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on various criteria.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the provided DataFrames.
3. From the runtime values and types provided, it seems that the function correctly retrieves and compares the axes and blocks of both `BlockManager` instances. However, the issue may lie in the sorting logic when canonicalizing the blocks for comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct logic is applied for determining equality between blocks.
5. Let's correct the function based on the analysis and the provided GitHub issue for context.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances and return the expected results, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
