### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class in `managers.py`. The function is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block locations. The issue arises from the comparison logic used for the blocks within the function.

#### Problem:
The comparison of blocks is inconsistent with the expected behavior. The current implementation compares the blocks based on a sorting order that does not consider the actual data within the blocks. This leads to incorrect equality checks, causing the failing test case.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual data within the blocks instead of relying solely on sorting based on type and locations. By comparing the blocks at each index, we can ensure that the equality check is accurate.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting based on type or location, we ensure that the equality check considers the actual data content within the blocks. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
