The bug in the `equals` function stems from an issue with the comparison of blocks in different locations. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return `True` even when comparing DataFrames with blocks in different locations.

The bug arises from the `canonicalize` function that is used to sort the blocks based on their location. The sorting mechanism is not accounting for the tuple combination of the type name and the manager locations, which are essential for accurately identifying blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to include the manager locations in the sorting mechanism. By combining the type name and manager locations in the `canonicalize` function, the blocks from different locations can be correctly distinguished and compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the manager locations as a tuple, we ensure that blocks with different locations are properly distinguished. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should now correctly return `False` when comparing DataFrames with blocks in different locations.
