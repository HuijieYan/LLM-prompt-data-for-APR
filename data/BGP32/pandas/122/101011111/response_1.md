### Bug Explanation:

The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks' content without taking into consideration the locations of the blocks. Therefore, even if the content of the blocks is the same but located differently, the function incorrectly returns `True`. This behavior is causing the test to fail. 

### Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to include the block locations in the comparison. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include the locations of the blocks. By considering both the content and the locations of the blocks, we can ensure that the blocks are truly equal. 

### Updated and Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This correction ensures that the block locations are taken into account during the comparison, fixing the bug and allowing the function to return the correct result for the given test case.
