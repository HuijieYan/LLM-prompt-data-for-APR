### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects by first checking the axes, consolidating their data, comparing the number of blocks, and then comparing each block's content. The bug seems to stem from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function, which may not correctly distinguish between blocks with different locations but identical content, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on their type name and locations using `canonicalize`. This could lead to incorrect comparison results when blocks with different locations but the same content are sorted differently.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare blocks based on content rather than their locations. One approach could involve sorting the blocks based on content alone before comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_content = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_content = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    self_blocks_content.sort()
    other_blocks_content.sort()

    return all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks_content, other_blocks_content))
```

This corrected version focuses on comparing the content of blocks by sorting them based on their values before performing the comparison. This approach should address the issue mentioned in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
