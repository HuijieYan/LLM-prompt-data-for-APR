### Fixing the Bug

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function in the buggy code compares blocks based on their data types and memory locations, using the `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` method, which is not a reliable method for comparison. When the test dataframes are swapped in position, the equal blocks have different memory locations, causing the comparison to fail. The `equals` function incorrectly returns False in this scenario.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix involves modifying the comparison logic to compare blocks based on their data and not their memory locations. This change ensures that identical blocks are correctly identified as equal, irrespective of their memory locations.

#### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize_data(block):
        if isinstance(block, BaseBlock):
            return block.values
        else:
            return block
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_data)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares blocks based on their data content, ensuring that two identical blocks are considered equal even if they have different memory locations. This fix addresses the specific issue reported on GitHub and should resolve the failing test case.
