## Correction of the Buggy Function

To address the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, we need to focus on sorting the blocks based on a consistent criterion that considers both dtype and mgr_locs. The bug arises from inconsistencies in block sorting, which leads to incorrect comparison results.

Here's a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a consistent key function to sort blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs
    def block_key(b):
        return (b.dtype.name, b.mgr_locs.to_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_key)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `block_key` function is used as a key function to generate tuples for sorting blocks. This ensures that the sorting logic is consistent and considers both the dtype and mgr_locs attributes of the blocks.

With this correction, the `equals` method should now return the correct comparison results for DataFrames with blocks in different locations but matching content. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.
