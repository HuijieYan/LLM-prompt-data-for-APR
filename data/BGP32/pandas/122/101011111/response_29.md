### The Bug
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2`. The issue arises because the function is not correctly handling the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, leading to a false positive result.

### Error Cause
The bug occurs at the block comparison stage of the `equals` function. The function checks if each block in `self.blocks` is equal to the corresponding block in `other.blocks`. The comparison should include location information to handle cases where identical blocks might have different locations. However, the comparison currently overlooks this factor, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to take into account the locations of the blocks. By incorporating location information into the comparison process, we can ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly flagged as unequal.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including `block.mgr_locs == oblock.mgr_locs` in the comparison logic, we ensure that block locations are considered. This modification will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue by correctly handling cases of identical blocks with different locations.
