### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The bug arises from sorting the blocks based on their data type and location using the `canonicalize` function. However, the bug occurs when two identical blocks with different locations are considered unequal due to the sorting method.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to compare blocks based on their actual content rather than their data type and location. This can be achieved by modifying the comparison logic to check the equality of block values directly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version of the `equals` function directly compares the blocks in the `BlockManager` objects without sorting them based on their type and location. This change ensures that blocks are considered equal if their content matches, regardless of their location.

By utilizing this corrected function, the failing test cases should now pass, and the bug highlighted in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
