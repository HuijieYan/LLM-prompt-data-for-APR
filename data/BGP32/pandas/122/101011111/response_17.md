### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to comparing blocks in a different order than expected. The function sorts the blocks based on the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, which can lead to incorrect results. In the failing test case provided, DataFrame `df1` and DataFrame `df2` have the same columns but in a different order. The buggy `equals` function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks in the same order in which they are present in the DataFrame. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks in their original order without sorting them based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function above should resolve the issue and correctly handle DataFrame comparisons with columns in different orders.
