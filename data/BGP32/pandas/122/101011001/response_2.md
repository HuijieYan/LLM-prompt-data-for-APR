### Analysis:
Based on the provided information, the buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. The comparison involves the following steps:
1. Check if the number of axes (dimensions) of the two `BlockManager` objects is the same.
2. Check if the axes are equal for each corresponding axis.
3. Consolidate the blocks within each `BlockManager` object.
4. Check if the number of blocks in each `BlockManager` object is the same.
5. Sort the blocks based on their type name and location.
6. Compare each block from one `BlockManager` object with the corresponding block from the other `BlockManager` object.

The failing test case involves two `DataFrame` objects with columns "a" and "b" swapped. The assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing because the comparison in the buggy `equals` function is returning `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug:
The bug likely arises from the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function. The function sorts the blocks based on type name and location to ensure consistent comparison, but the comparison itself is done incorrectly.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to correctly compare the blocks. We can compare two `Block` objects based on their data and characteristics to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
``` 

In the corrected version, the `equals` function now compares the blocks using the `equals` method of each `Block` object, ensuring a proper comparison for equality. This should address the bug and make the failing test case pass.
