### Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals(self, other)`. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and block contents. The error message indicates that the test failed when comparing two DataFrames since the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` returned `assert True is False`.

### Bugs:
1. The buggy function is using a method named `equals` contained in the block instances, which is not the correct method to call for comparison.
2. The function is sorting the blocks based on a key generated by the `canonicalize` function, which sorts based on dtype name and manager locations. This leads to the wrong comparison between blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of using the `equals` method of blocks to compare them, direct comparison of the block data should be performed.
2. The comparison logic should be modified to compare block values directly rather than attempting to sort based on dtype name and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values)
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version:
1. Direct comparison of block values using `np.array_equal` is performed.
2. Sorting based on dtype name and manager locations is removed.
3. The corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
