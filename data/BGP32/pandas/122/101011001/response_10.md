### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of data blocks within two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison process involves sorting the blocks based on their data type and location, but the bug is caused by an incorrect comparison of data blocks because the location of the blocks is not being considered properly.

In the failing test scenario provided, the two `DataFrames` `df1` and `df2` have columns in different order causing their equality check to fail. However, due to the buggy implementation of the `equals` function, the sorting of blocks based on data type and location does not account for this discrepancy in column order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the data blocks' contents based on the actual location of columns. This will ensure that the order of the columns in the `BlockManager` instances is preserved and correctly compared.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function incorporating the necessary changes:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or list(self_axes) != list(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())  # Fix here to use .tolist() instead of .as_array.tolist()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the above corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses `mgr_locs.tolist()` instead of `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to properly consider the location of data blocks.

This fix ensures that the comparison logic of data blocks within two `BlockManager` instances includes the column order and location, addressing the bug identified in the failing test case.
