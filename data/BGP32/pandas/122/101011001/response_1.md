### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two BlockManager objects based on their axes and blocks attributes. The comparison involves checking if the axes have the same length and if all corresponding axes objects are equal. Then, it consolidates the BlockManager objects in place and compares their blocks. The comparison is done using a canonicalization process to sort the blocks before comparing them.

The failing test is due to the fact that the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have different values in their columns, but the buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly. The function assumes that the axes and blocks of the two objects should be exactly the same, but it does not consider the actual data values within the blocks.

### Bug:
The bug in the function is that it directly compares the blocks without considering the actual values within the blocks. This leads to incorrect equality checks when the blocks have different data values but the same data types and positions.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals(self, other)` function to compare the actual values within the blocks instead of just the types and positions. This can be achieved by iterating over the values in the blocks and comparing them one by one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare values inside the blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
``` 

By comparing the actual values within the blocks, the corrected version will correctly identify the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` as not equal and pass the failing test.
