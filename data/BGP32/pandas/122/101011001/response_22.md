### Analysis:
The buggy function is trying to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It first checks if the axes are equal, then consolidates the blocks in both objects, and finally compares the blocks for equality after sorting them based on type name and manager locations.

The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects (`df1` and `df2`) fails and returns `True` instead of `False`. This implies that the buggy function implementation is incorrect in handling the equality check.

Looking at the runtime values and types of variables, we can see that the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted based on a custom key generated by the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses the `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create a tuple for sorting. However, the `block.dtype.name` is the dtype of the block itself, not the dtype of the data within the block. This causes incorrect sorting and subsequently incorrect equality comparison.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by using the block's dtype name for sorting instead of the actual data dtype within the block. This leads to incorrect sorting, which results in incorrect equality comparison between the blocks.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data dtype of the block instead of the block's dtype name.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        data_dtype = block.dtype
        mgr_locs_array = block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        return (data_dtype, mgr_locs_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `data_dtype` instead of the `dtype.name`, the blocks will be sorted based on the actual data dtype, leading to correct equality comparison between the `BlockManager` objects.
