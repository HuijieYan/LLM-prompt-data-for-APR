### Bug Explanation
The bug arises because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not correctly handle the case where the data blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are in different orders. The function incorrectly assumes that sorting the blocks based on the combination of data type (`dtype.name`) and memory block locations (`mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`) will ensure consistency between the two `BlockManager` instances. This assumption is flawed since the ordering of blocks can vary based on their content, not just their type and location.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` properly accounts for differing block orders. Instead of relying on sorting, we should directly compare corresponding blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances based on their content. We can achieve this by iterating over each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` simultaneously and checking for equality.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function with an emphasis on directly comparing corresponding blocks:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By iterating over the blocks directly and comparing them in order, we ensure a more accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances, fixing the bug identified by the failing test case.
