### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing two DataFrames. The function incorrectly compares blocks within the DataFrames using the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on their data type and location. The bug arises from the fact that the DataFrames being compared have swapped data types in their columns which should result in `equals` returning `False` but the function fails to do so.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `canonicalize` function which compares blocks based on their data type and location, but it does not consider the values within the blocks, leading to incorrect comparison and returning `True` instead of `False` when the DataFrames have swapped data types in their columns.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic needs to be refined. Instead of relying solely on the data type and location of the blocks, the function should also compare the actual values within the blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By directly comparing the blocks' values in the corrected version, the function should now correctly identify and return `False` when the DataFrames have swapped data types in their columns.
