### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises because it checks for equality between two dataframes based on the order of the blocks within them. If the order of the blocks is different between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, even if the content of the blocks is equivalent, the function will return `False`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function so that it compares blocks based on their content rather than their order.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Content-wise comparison of blocks
    def are_blocks_equal(block1, block2):
        if block1.shape != block2.shape:
            return False
        return block1._can_hold_element(block2)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)

    return all(
        are_blocks_equal(block1, block2)
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the comparison logic to compare the content of the blocks instead of their order, the corrected `equals` function will be able to compare two dataframes accurately.
