### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals()` method in the `BlockManager` class of pandas. Its purpose is to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the method is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two unequal DataFrames.
3. The sequence of operations in the buggy function involves comparing the axes of two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidating them, comparing the number of blocks, and finally comparing the blocks. The bug likely exists in the comparison of blocks because it returns `True` when it should be `False`.
4. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize()` function used to sort the blocks is not working correctly. The sorting order of blocks is not being correctly reflected, leading to the invalid equality comparison.
5. To fix the bug, ensure that the `canonicalize()` function computes a value that uniquely identifies each block for correct sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on unique identifiers for each block
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._consolidate_inplace(), block.dtype.name, str(block.values))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize()` function now includes `_consolidate_inplace()` for each block, alongside the dtype and values. This ensures that each block is uniquely identified for correct sorting and comparison, fixing the bug in the equality check.
