The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison logic between two BlockManager instances in the `equals` method. The function aims to compare two BlockManager instances based on their axes and blocks. The issue is that the function incorrectly compares the block data of the two instances without considering the actual data content.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between the two DataFrame instances (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This discrepancy is due to the comparison logic within the `equals` function of the BlockManager class.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the comparison mechanism to consider the actual data within the blocks of the BlockManager instances. The current implementation only compares the block metadata but not the data content.

Here is a corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over each block in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` and compare them using the `equals` method of the Block class. This way, we ensure that both the metadata and the actual data within the blocks are considered during the comparison.

By applying this fix, the function should now correctly compare two BlockManager instances based on both their block metadata and actual block data, addressing the issue identified in the failing test case.
