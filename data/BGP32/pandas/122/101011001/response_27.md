### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` inside the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The error message from the failing test indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, which means the function is returning `True` incorrectly.

From the runtime values and types provided, it can be observed that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain tuples of Blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic of these blocks.

At the end of the function, there is a sorting operation based on a custom key method `canonicalize`. The bug might be arising from how the blocks are being sorted and compared after sorting.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. The custom `canonicalize` function should accurately represent the uniqueness of each block to avoid incorrect orderings.
2. Ensure that the sorting operation considers all the block characteristics that could potentially differentiate between blocks.
3. Check the logic where the actual equality comparison is occurring after sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By ensuring a more robust representation in the `canonicalize` function based on block characteristics and addressing any issues in the sorting and comparison logic, the corrected version of the `equals` function should pass the failing test.
