### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function lies in the way it's comparing the blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. However, in the given scenario, the block data types are different, causing the sorting to fail, leading to a false negative in the equality check.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the block data types when creating the tuple for sorting. This way, blocks with different data types will not be considered equal even if their `mgr_locs` are the same.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, mgr_locs, and dtype because blocks may have the same mgr_locs
    # but different data types
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), type(block))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the block data type when defining the sorting key as a tuple, the function will correctly handle comparisons between blocks with different data types, resolving the bug.
