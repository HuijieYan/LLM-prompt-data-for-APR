### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the incorrect comparison of values between two DataFrames. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails where `True is False`, indicating that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The issue lies in the section where the blocks of each DataFrame are compared. The bug stems from the `canonicalize` function which generates a key for sorting the blocks. In this case, the bug occurs because the comparison key is not robust enough to differentiate between the data in the blocks of the two DataFrames.

The function sorts the blocks based on the data type name and the memory locations of the blocks. This can lead to incorrect comparisons since two blocks with different data but same type name and memory locations may be considered equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to revise the `canonicalize` function to generate a unique key that accurately represents the data within the blocks. Instead of relying on data type name and memory locations, we should compare the actual values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block._data

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the actual block data directly rather than relying on the data type name and memory locations, this corrected version of the function should now accurately assess the equality of DataFrames.
