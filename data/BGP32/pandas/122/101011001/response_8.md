### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` represented by `self` and `other`.
2. The function compares the axes of both instances and then tries to sort and compare the blocks within them.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed with `True is False`, meaning that the function incorrectly returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
4. The comparison logic within the function appears to be incorrect, leading to a misinterpretation of whether the two `BlockManager` instances are equal or not.
5. The issue likely arises from the comparison logic and the order of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Verify the logic used to compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
2. Check if the sorting and comparison of blocks based on `canonicalize` function is correct.
3. Ensure that the comparison of each block is accurate.
4. Check if there are any issues with comparing the axes of the two instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, hash(str(block.values)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the comparison logic inside the `canonicalize` function to include hashing of block values, the corrected function should now be able to properly compare the `BlockManager` instances and return the correct result.
