### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `equals` is due to the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function sorts the blocks based on the tuple created by `canonicalize` function, which combines the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` of the blocks. Then it iterates over the sorted blocks and checks if each block is equal between `self` and `other`. However, the bug arises because the `canonicalize` function is not handling the case where blocks with different types (e.g., int and object) are present in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This causes incorrect comparison and leads to the failing assert statement in the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be modified to handle blocks with different types properly. One approach is to add a condition to differentiate between different types in the tuple comparison. This will ensure that blocks with different types are not considered equal during comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Bug-free Runtime Scenario
With the corrected version of the function, the failing test will pass, and the comparison between `df1` and `df2` (defined in the error message) in the test will correctly return `False`. The bug has been fixed by properly handling blocks with different types during the comparison.
