### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by the logic used to compare blocks in two `BlockManager` instances. The function sorts the blocks in each `BlockManager` by type name and manager locations before comparing them. However, the bug arises because when comparing two blocks, it calls the `equals` method on each block, which compares the contents of the blocks. The issue is that when the blocks have different types (e.g., an integer block and an object block), the comparison fails, even if the data is structurally equivalent.

### Bug Explanation
1. The given input parameter values show that the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` contain an `IntBlock` and an `ObjectBlock`, respectively, with swapped positions between the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. In the `canonicalize` function used for sorting, `block.dtype.name` will return `int64` for an `IntBlock` and `object` for an `ObjectBlock`.
3. Since the types are different, the `block.equals(oblock)` comparison fails, causing the `equals` function to return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we can modify the block comparison logic to handle different types of blocks. Instead of directly calling the `equals` method on each block, we can check if the block types match before performing a comparison. If the types match, we can proceed with the usual comparison. If they don't match, we can compare the values directly since the equality of data is what matters.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        (block.dtype.name == oblock.dtype.name) and (block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)) \
        and block.values.equals(oblock.values) \
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By checking the block types and comparing the block values directly, we ensure that the `equals` function correctly determines if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their data, regardless of the block types.
