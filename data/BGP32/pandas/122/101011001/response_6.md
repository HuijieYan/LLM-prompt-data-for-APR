### Bug Explanation:
The error occurs because the `equals` function is comparing two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that have different values in their columns 'a' and 'b'. The assert statement expects `df1.equals(df2)` to be False, but since the function implementation is not handling this case correctly, it returns True. The issue lies in how the blocks are sorted before comparison.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the sorting logic in the `equals` function to handle DataFrames with different values in columns. Instead of relying solely on sorting blocks by name and location, we can take into account the types of blocks and their content for comparison.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    sorted_self_blocks = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        if block not in sorted_self_blocks:
            sorted_self_blocks.append(block)

    sorted_other_blocks = []
    for block in other.blocks:
        if block not in sorted_other_blocks:
            sorted_other_blocks.append(block)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(sorted_self_blocks, sorted_other_blocks))
```

By ensuring that only unique blocks are considered during sorting and comparing the DataFrames, this corrected version addresses the bug and should pass the failing test case.
