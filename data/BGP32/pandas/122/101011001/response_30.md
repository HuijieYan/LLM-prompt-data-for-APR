### Issue:
The buggy function's logic for comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is incorrect, leading to the failing test. It is currently sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` and then comparing each block for equality. However, in the failing test case, the values of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are swapped, causing the comparison to return `True` incorrectly.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for comparing `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks directly, we should first match corresponding blocks based on their positions before comparing them for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Match corresponding blocks based on position before comparing
    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By comparing blocks directly based on their positions, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
