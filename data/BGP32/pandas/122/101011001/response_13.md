### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The comparison logic attempts to sort the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values. However, in the provided runtime values, the `mgr_locs` attribute seems to be a `BlockPlacement` object, which is not directly compatible with the sorting mechanism used in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly handles the `mgr_locs` attribute for blocks that are of type `BlockPlacement`. One way to achieve this is to modify the `canonicalize` function to extract relevant information from the `mgr_locs` attribute of different block types and use that information for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Based on the bug explanation and fix strategy, here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Previous functions 

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            if isinstance(block, IntBlock):
                return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
            elif isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
                return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
            # Add handling for other block types if necessary
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to handle different block types appropriately, we can ensure that the comparison of `BlockManager` objects based on block attributes works correctly. This should address the issue identified by the failing test case.
