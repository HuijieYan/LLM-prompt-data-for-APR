### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the provided function `equals` is related to comparing two dataframes for equality. The function sorts the blocks within the dataframes by the block type and locations, then compares the sorted blocks for equality. However, the bug occurs because the datatype of the values within the blocks affects the sorting and comparison.

The failing test is asserting that two dataframes `df1` and `df2` are not equal. The issue arises due to the wrong comparison of different datatypes ('int64' vs. 'object') in the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare blocks with the same datatypes. One approach to achieve this is by converting all blocks to a consistent format or datatype before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we use `str(block.dtype)` to ensure that the datatype of the blocks is consistently converted to a string representation before sorting and comparing the blocks. This modification will prevent the bug and enable proper comparison of dataframes for equality.
