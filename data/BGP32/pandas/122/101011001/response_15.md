### Cause of the bug
The bug in the `equals` function arises because the comparison logic of blocks between `self` and `other` block managers is based on sorting the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs` (block placement). However, the bug occurs due to incorrect comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function. In the failing test, the DataFrame `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types (`int64` vs. `object`), leading to a false positive equality result. This is because the `canonicalize` function does not account for different data types when sorting the blocks, leading to wrongly sorted blocks and incorrect equality evaluation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should be revised to consider the data type of the block in addition to its `mgr_locs` for sorting. By including the dtype information in the sorting process, blocks with different data types will be appropriately distinguished, ensuring a correct comparison. This revised sorting criteria will address the issue observed in the failing test and ensure the `equals` function provides the correct equality evaluation between block managers.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Revised canonicalize function to consider dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on both their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, the corrected `equals` function will now correctly compare block managers even if they contain blocks with different data types, ensuring accurate equality evaluations.
