### Explanation:
The buggy function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. However, the bug causes it to incorrectly determine that two instances are equal when they are not. The bug arises from the way the function sorts and compares the `blocks` attribute of `self` and `other`. The incorrect comparison logic leads to the buggy behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances accurately determines their equality based on the underlying blocks they contain. By properly sorting and comparing the `blocks`, we can address the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now considers `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` and `values` when sorting the blocks. This ensures a more accurate comparison between the blocks, resolving the bug.
