### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.

In the provided runtime values and types of variables, we can observe that the axes and blocks of both `self` and `other` instances are similar, but due to the block ordering, the equality check is failing.

The issue arises from sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple combining the type name and the `mgr_locs`. The `mgr_locs` attribute is causing the blocks to be sorted in a way that leads to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect use of `mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function to determine block order. Since `mgr_locs` may not represent a block identity uniquely, sorting blocks based on it can lead to incorrect equality comparisons.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to exclude `mgr_locs` from the sorting criteria. We can simplify the sorting based solely on the block data type.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By removing `mgr_locs` from the sorting criteria, the corrected version ensures that blocks are compared based solely on their data type, eliminating the erroneous comparison results.
