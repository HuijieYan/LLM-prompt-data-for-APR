### Analysis:
The buggy function is comparing two BlockManager instances to check if they are equal. The comparison involves comparing the axes, consolidating the data structures, comparing the number of blocks, sorting the blocks using a custom key function, and finally comparing each block pair.

The failing test is demonstrating an issue with the equality comparison of two DataFrames. The test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but the actual returned value is `True`.

The input parameter values and types provided for the buggy function indicate that the axes, blocks, and their content are constructed properly. However, the custom key function used for sorting the blocks may not be working as expected, leading to incorrect block comparisons and ultimately resulting in a wrong equality judgment for the BlockManagers.

### Bug:
The bug seems to be in the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. The `canonicalize` function defines the sorting key as a combination of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the `mgr_locs` conversion to a list, `as_array.tolist()`, may not be functioning correctly for proper comparison.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly converts the manager locations to a list for comparison. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to directly return the `mgr_locs` as a list without using `tolist()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)  # Updated to return as array directly

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly compare the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations as arrays, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
