### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which combines the type name and `mgr_locs`. In the failing test case, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns of different data types which leads to incorrect comparison and assertion failure.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider only the data type of the block for sorting, to ensure correct comparison based on data type. 

### Updated `canonicalize` function:
```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return block.dtype.name
```

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on data type only
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making this change, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on data type and resolve the failing test case.
