The bug in the provided `equals` function is related to the comparison of DataFrame blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` in the failing test is showing `True is False `, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function compares the values inside the blocks of DataFrames by sorting them based on the block's datatype name and their manager locations.
2. The bug likely occurs when comparing blocks with different dtype names. In this case, the integer block from `df1` is compared with the object block from `df2`, resulting in a mismatch and returning `False`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that blocks are compared correctly based on their data types. One approach is to skip comparing blocks with different data type names. We can update the sorting key function `canonicalize` to take into account the data type name before comparing the manager locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version should address the bug by ensuring that blocks with different data types are not mistakenly compared, thus resolving the assertion error in the failing test.
