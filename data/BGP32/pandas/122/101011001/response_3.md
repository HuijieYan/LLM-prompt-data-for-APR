### Analysis:
The buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances, which contain `axes` and `blocks`. The function checks if the axes lengths are equal, then iterates over the blocks to compare them. In the failing test case provided, the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames contain columns of different types in a different order, leading to a failed equality check.

The key issue in the buggy function is the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a canonicalization function that depends on the block's data type name and location within the manager. This approach results in sorting blocks by data type name, which is not suitable for comparing data frames with different column types in a different order.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks does not consider the column's data type and order, leading to incorrect block sorting.
2. Sorting based on data type names can lead to misalignment of blocks if the columns are of different types in different DataFrames.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting logic in the buggy function. Instead of using the data type name for sorting, we should consider the columns' data type, order, and values to ensure correct comparison between DataFrames.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not self_axes.equals(other_axes):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks based on data type, order, and values
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By comparing `axes` directly for equality and adjusting the block comparison to consider the data type, order, and values, the corrected version should properly handle comparisons between DataFrames with different column types and orders.
