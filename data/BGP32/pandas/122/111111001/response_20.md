### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing their blocks for equality.
2. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different values for columns 'a' and 'b' and asserts that they are not equal.
3. The error message shows that the assertion fails because `True is False`.
4. The buggy function compares the blocks without considering the actual values in the blocks, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function without considering the actual values within the blocks. This comparison only considers the block dtype and mgr_locs, which results in incorrect equality evaluations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual values within the blocks rather than just comparing the block properties. We should iterate over the blocks and compare their values individually to determine equality correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block for equality based on values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over each block and comparing their values in the corrected function, we can ensure correct equality evaluation between `BlockManager` instances.
