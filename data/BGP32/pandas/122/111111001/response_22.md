#### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is not handling the comparison of blocks correctly. The function is comparing the blocks in a sorted order, but the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is incorrect. The function `canonicalize` returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and the `mgr_locs` of the block, which is then converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. However, `mgr_locs` is an attribute of the block, not a method, so calling it like a method raises an error.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should use the attribute `as_array` directly without calling it as a method. Additionally, the dtype name can be extracted using `block.dtype` directly. By correcting these issues, the comparison between blocks can proceed correctly.

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By using the corrected version provided above, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` class, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
