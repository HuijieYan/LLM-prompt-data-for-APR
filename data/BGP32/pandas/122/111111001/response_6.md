The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager objects to check if they are equal. The issue arises when comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the axes of the two BlockManager objects are the same, and if they are not, it returns False. Then it consolidates the blocks within both objects, sorts them based on type name and mgr_locs, and finally compares each pair of blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks at the end of the function.

The issue stems from the comparison process of the blocks. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks for comparison, where it returns a tuple containing the dtype name of the block and the as_array of mgr_locs. Later, the comparison between the sorted self_blocks and other_blocks is performed using `all`. The bug lies in fetching `block.dtype.name` and converting `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` in the `canonicalize` function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly converts block dtype name and mgr_locs into a format suitable for comparison. The dtype name should be fetched using `block.dtype` instead of `block.dtype.name`, and the `mgr_locs` should be accessed correctly to obtain a comparable format.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.to_list())  # Modify the conversion methods here as needed

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the tuple generation in the `canonicalize` function, the comparison of blocks should work correctly now, addressing the issue raised in the failing test.
