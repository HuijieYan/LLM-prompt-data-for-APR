### Analysis
The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them in place and compares the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it sorts the blocks in both instances with a canonicalization function and checks if each block equals the corresponding block in the other instance.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances where the values are swapped between columns. This test expects the `equals` method of the first instance to return `False` as the two instances are not equal. However, the function is not behaving as expected, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The issue stems from the way the `canonicalize` function handles the block's `mgr_locs`. The `block.mgr_locs` is not a list that can be directly converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()`. This leads to an incorrect comparison of blocks, causing the function to mistakenly consider the instances equal.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly compare the `mgr_locs` values. Instead of converting it directly to a list, we should compare the object itself or perform another type of comparison suitable for the `mgr_locs` attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mgr_locs` attribute is compared correctly by converting it to a string within the `canonicalize` function. This modification will address the bug and make the `equals` method work as intended for comparing two `BlockManager` instances.
