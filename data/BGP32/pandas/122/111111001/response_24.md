### Explanation
The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. It fails to correctly identify inequality between two instances, leading to the failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.

The function first checks if the lengths of the axes (labels for the blocks) of two `BlockManager` instances are the same. Then it iterates over each axis and checks if they are equal. Next, it consolidates the two instances in place by calling `_consolidate_inplace` method on both objects. Finally, it compares the blocks between the two instances, but due to incorrect canonicalization before comparison, the function fails to correctly identify differences in the block order.

The canonicalization function creates a tuple with the block's data type name and `mgr_locs` (which may be problematic if the blocks are not consolidated). This incorrect approach leads to a mismatch in block comparisons, resulting in the function returning `True` incorrectly when two different `BlockManager` instances are passed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to ensure that block comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly, considering the different data types and labels. 

One approach to fix this bug is:
1. Ensure both instances are consolidated before comparison.
2. Change the canonicalization method to consider block data type and labels.
3. Sort and compare the blocks between the two instances by their data types and labels.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs, block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their type, `mgr_locs`, data type name, and values before comparison, we ensure that the two `BlockManager` instances are correctly considered equal or unequal based on their actual contents.
