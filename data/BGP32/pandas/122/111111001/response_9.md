### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The comparison logic is flawed, causing the function to return incorrect results for DataFrame comparison.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function compares the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances based on their order after sorting, using a `canonicalize` function to define the comparison key. 
2. The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function, where it generates the key for comparison by combining the dtype name and mgr_locs as a list. This combination is not stable across different blocks, leading to incorrect sorting.
3. As a result, the function fails to correctly compare the blocks of self and other `BlockManager` instances, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. The key generation for sorting blocks should be uniform and stable across different block types. 
2. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to create a tuple combining the dtype name and `mgr_locs` as a tuple to ensure a consistent comparison key for sorting blocks.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use a tuple combining the dtype name and `mgr_locs` as a tuple, the comparison key will be consistent, and the blocks will be correctly sorted for comparison. This correction should ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct results for DataFrame comparison.
