### Bug Analysis
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` that are clearly not equal since their columns have different types. However, the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but due to the bug in the `equals` method implementation, it returns `True`.

The bug occurs when the function compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances. The method iterates over the blocks in a sorted order, attempting to check equality between each block in the two instances. The bug arises in the block canonicalization step, where it uses the block dtype name and manager locations to sort the blocks. Since the columns in the provided example have different data types and column order, the sorted blocks are not matching as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic to consider the different data types and maintain the order of columns when comparing the blocks. One possible approach is to compare the blocks based on their positions within the original `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` lists without sorting them based on data type. Additionally, we need to enhance the block comparison logic to handle cases where the block data types differ.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        block = self.blocks[i]
        oblock = other.blocks[i]

        # Compare blocks based on their dtype and data
        if block.values.dtype != oblock.values.dtype:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
```

By comparing the blocks directly based on their position without sorting and handling data type comparisons explicitly, we ensure a correct comparison between two `BlockManager` instances in the `equals` method. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
