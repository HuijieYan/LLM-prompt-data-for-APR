The issue in the provided buggy function is related to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function `equals` is used to compare the equality of two `BlockManager` objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic for blocks is flawed, leading to incorrect equality checks.

The buggy function attempts to sort `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on a custom `canonicalize` function and then compares each pair of blocks. The blocks are sorted based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The bug arises from an incorrect comparison logic that fails to recognize the inequality in the blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the blocks directly rather than attempting to sort and compare them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Compare blocks directly
        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will directly compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances to determine equality, resolving the bug in the comparison logic.
