### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check if they are equal. The comparison involves checking the axes, consolidating the data in-place, comparing the number of blocks, and then iterating over the blocks to check their equality.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The comparison logic does not reflect the actual content of the blocks, leading to the function returning incorrect results. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks considers their actual data content for equality checking. This can be achieved by comparing the actual data within blocks rather than their type and locations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = list(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = list(other.blocks)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the blocks content
    return all(b1.equals(b2) for b1, b2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected version, the bug involving incorrect block comparison has been addressed. This should now allow the `equals()` function to correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances.
