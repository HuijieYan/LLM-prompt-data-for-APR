### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their axes, consolidating them, and then comparing their blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparisons being done for the blocks. The comparison involves sorting the blocks by dtype name and mgr_locs, but the implementation seems incorrect based on the failing test case and the provided runtime values.

### Error Cause:
1. The `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` might not be the correct way to identify blocks uniquely for comparison.
2. Since the failing test involves comparing two dataframes with different values in the columns, the blocks might not be directly comparable using the current sorting method.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of trying to compare the blocks by sorting them based on dtype and mgr_locs, a more direct comparison method should be used to handle the comparison of values in the blocks.
2. Update the comparison logic to compare the actual values within the blocks rather than the block objects themselves.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Based on the error analysis, a corrected version of the `equals` function is provided below:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes directly
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the blocks
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks based on values
    self_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_data, other_data)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the values in the blocks for equality, ensuring that the comparison is based on the actual data rather than the block objects themselves.
