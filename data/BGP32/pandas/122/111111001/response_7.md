### Buggy Function Analysis
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes of the two objects are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
3. It then consolidates both objects in place before comparing the number of blocks they contain.
4. The function attempts to canonicalize the order of blocks by sorting them based on a tuple of type name and manager locations.
5. Finally, it compares each block from one object with the corresponding block in the other object.
6. The failure in the provided test occurs because the comparison between two dataframes fails.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely arises from the incorrect comparison being made between the blocks in the two `BlockManager` objects. The function is sorting the blocks and then comparing them using the `equals` method, which might not be implemented correctly for the blocks in this context.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks using `block.equals(oblock)` is correct. This may involve updating the comparison logic within the loop that iterates over the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version uses `str(block.dtype)` to get the name of the dtype and `block.mgr_locs.as_slice()` to get a slice object of manager locations to create a unique tuple key for ordering the blocks. The comparison logic within the loop remains the same.
