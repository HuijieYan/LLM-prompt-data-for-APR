The bug in the `equals` function stems from the way the blocks are being compared for equality between `self` and `other`. The comparison logic is considering the block order without considering the actual values contained within the blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function inside the `equals` function to compare the actual values in the blocks as well. This will ensure that the equality comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will now take into account the values stored within the blocks when comparing them for equality. This should address the issue causing the failing test.
