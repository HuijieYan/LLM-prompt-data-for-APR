### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to check if the current `BlockManager` object is equal to another `BlockManager` object based on their axes attributes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic inside the function.

### Issues:
1. The comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is flawed because the canonicalization process is not correctly identifying blocks and their order for comparison.
2. The use of the `equals` method within the loop is likely not comparing the blocks correctly.

### Bug:
The buggy function fails when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with different block order. The current canonicalization method is not correctly identifying blocks for comparison due to flaws in the `canonicalize` function and subsequent block sorting.

### Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to properly identify blocks for comparison based on their dtype and location rather than solely their name.
2. Implement a correct comparison logic within the loop to compare each block from `self` with the corresponding block from `other`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With the corrected version above, the `equals` function should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and block contents. This corrected version should pass the failing test successfully.
