### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. The issue arises when checking if the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal. The bug is likely due to the comparison being incorrect.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function receives two `BlockManager` instances as input (`self` and `other`) along with their axes and blocks.
2. The function compares the lengths of the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances. If they are not equal, the function returns `False`.
3. Next, the function consolidates the internal data structures of both `BlockManager` instances using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
4. The function then checks if the number of blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
5. The bug arises in the block comparison process. The function attempts to canonicalize the blocks based on their type name and manager locations to compare them correctly. However, the canonicalize function does not handle the block comparison properly, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the block comparison logic in the `equals` function. The comparison should ensure that the blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances are correctly matched based on their type and manager locations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.values.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Applying this correction should resolve the bug in the `equals` function and make the failing test pass successfully.
