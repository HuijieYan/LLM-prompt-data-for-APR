### Analysis:
- The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal.
- The function checks if the axes and blocks of the two instances are equal but encounters issues due to the order of blocks.
- It tries to sort and compare the blocks using the `canonicalize` function that combines the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block.
- The comparison fails due to mismatching block order even when the content is the same.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the order of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` may differ even when the content is the same. The sorting based on the `canonicalize` function may not be accurate, leading to false inequality even for equal `BlockManager` instances.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on their content rather than relying solely on the `canonicalize` function. This way, we can ensure that equal blocks are matched correctly during comparison.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content rather than canonicalize function
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks directly using their content values, we eliminate the issue of mismatching block order leading to incorrect inequality results. This correction should resolve the failing test case.
