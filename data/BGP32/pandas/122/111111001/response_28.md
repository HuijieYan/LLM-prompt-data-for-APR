The bug in the `equals` function arises due to the incorrect comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The code attempts to sort the blocks based on a combination of the block's data type name and its location, but the comparison logic in the sorting function `canonicalize` is flawed.

The problem occurs in the line:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

The issue lies with `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which does not correctly represent the comparison value for the blocks. The incorrect comparison of block locations causes the sorting to be unreliable, leading to wrong comparisons between blocks.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to create a hashable representation of the block for comparison. A better approach is to use some unique identifier for each block that can ensure accurate comparison, such as the block index or another stable identifier.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: id(block))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By using the `id()` function as a sort key, we ensure that each block is uniquely identified and consistent across different calls. This modification should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly for the provided test case.
