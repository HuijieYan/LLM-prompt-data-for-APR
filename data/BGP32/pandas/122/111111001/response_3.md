### Bug Explanation
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from how the function sorts and compares the blocks. The function mistakenly sorts the blocks based on the combination of the dtype name and the manager locations, instead of directly comparing the blocks based on their values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` function should compare each block directly without sorting them. This can be achieved by iterating over the blocks in both `BlockManager` instances and checking if each block is equal to its corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing each block without sorting, the corrected `equals` function should now pass the failing test provided.
