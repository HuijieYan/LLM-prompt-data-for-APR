### Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function compares the axes and blocks of the two objects and returns `False` if there is any mismatch. The issue seems to stem from the comparison logic and the sorting of blocks before the equality check.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely in the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` where the `equals` method of the blocks is called. If the blocks are not sorted correctly, the comparison may fail even if the blocks are equivalent.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the blocks are sorted using a non-ideal key in `canonicalize` function, which might not represent the blocks uniquely. This leads to incorrect ordering and eventually the faulty equality check.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to generate a unique key that represents the blocks so that sorting maintains the correct relative order of blocks for comparison. This will ensure that equivalent blocks in `self` and `other` end up in the same order for the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version should address the issue by correctly sorting the blocks based on a unique representation, allowing for accurate comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects.
