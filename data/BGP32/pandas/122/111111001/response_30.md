### Identify the issue
The buggy function compares two BlockManagers by checking if they have the same axes, the same number of blocks, and then compares each block individually. However, the comparison of blocks is flawed because the canonicalization is not considering the block's specific location in the data structure.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because while comparing blocks in the `equals` function, the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the block's precise location in the data structure, leading to incorrect block comparison.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information in the comparison, ensuring a more accurate and reliable block comparison.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # include the block's location in the comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            block.values,
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the blocks will be sorted and compared based on their dtype, location, and values, ensuring an accurate comparison between the two BlockManagers.
