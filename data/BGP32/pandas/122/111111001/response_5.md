The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of blocks from two `BlockManager` instances where the blocks are sorted based on their data type name and location, but the comparison is done without considering the order of the blocks correctly. This results in the `equals` function not properly handling the comparison and leading to incorrect results in the failing test.

To fix the bug:
1. We should sort the blocks based on a tuple combining the type name and the manager locations.
2. Correctly compare the sorted blocks in order.
3. Update the `equals` function implementation to address the sorting and comparison issues.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function that resolves the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
  
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version properly sorts the blocks based on the data type name and manager locations and compares them in order.

After applying this fix, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should pass without any assertion errors.
