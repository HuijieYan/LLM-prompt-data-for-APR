### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided `equals` function arises from how the `canonicalize` function is processed. When sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, the `canonicalize` function is used to determine the key for the sorting. However, there is an issue with how the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed within the `canonicalize` function. The `mgr_locs` attribute should be accessed as an attribute directly on the `block` object, but it is being accessed incorrectly as `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, causing the bug.

This incorrect access leads to the issue where the `canonicalize` function does not return expected values, resulting in the incorrect comparison of blocks using the `all` function, thus failing the equality check between DataFrame objects in the failing test case.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `mgr_locs` attribute should be accessed directly on the `block` object within the `canonicalize` function. By ensuring the correct attribute access, the function will be able to correctly compare the blocks during the sorting process, leading to a successful equality check between the DataFrame objects.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function to access mgr_locs attribute directly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this correction should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work as expected, passing the failing test case.
