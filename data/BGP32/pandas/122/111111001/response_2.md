The bug in the `equals` function is likely due to the way the blocks are compared for equality. The function attempts to sort the blocks based on their data type name and location within the block manager, but this sorting may not be a reliable method to determine equality across different blocks.

To fix this bug, we can modify the equality comparison logic to compare the blocks directly based on their content.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self.blocks)):
        if not self.blocks[i].equals(other.blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares each block from `self.blocks` with the corresponding block from `other.blocks`. This ensures that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks rather than their type and location within the block manager.

With this fix, the failing test should now pass.
