### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class of pandas is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The error occurs in the case where the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects are not sorted in the same order, leading to incorrect comparison results.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test provided, `df1.equals(df2)` is expected to return `False` since the data within the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are different.
2. The bug occurs because within the `equals` function, the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other` are being sorted using the `canonicalize` function before comparison. However, the `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which does not guarantee a consistent order for comparison.
3. Due to this inconsistent sorting, even though the data within the blocks of `self` and `other` may match, the different block order causes the final `equals` comparison to return `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to sort the blocks based on a more robust method that ensures consistent ordering for comparison. One possible approach would be to directly compare the blocks within `self` and `other` based on their `mgr_locs` without relying on the `dtype.name` for sorting.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.mgr_locs  # Sort based on mgr_locs
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### After applying this correction, the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass successfully.
