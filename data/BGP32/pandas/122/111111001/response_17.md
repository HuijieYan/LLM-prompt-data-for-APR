### Analysis
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are of the same length and then goes on to compare the internal blocks for equality. The issue arises in the comparison of blocks, where the function might incorrectly return `True` even when the blocks are not equal.

The failing test creates two DataFrames that have their columns swapped and asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. The error message indicates that the assertion failed and shows the actual values of the DataFrames at the time of the assertion.

The runtime values and types of variables within the function show that the comparison of blocks is not correctly identifying the differences due to the way blocks are sorted and then compared.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. Since the blocks are sorted using a custom key based on block type and location, the comparison might not properly identify the differences between blocks that need to be considered as distinct.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared accurately, taking into account their actual content and structure rather than just their type and location. We should compare the blocks directly based on their individual elements.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `equals(self, other)` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we assume that the `equals` method of each block correctly compares their content for equality. This approach ensures that the comparison is done based on the actual block content rather than their attributes.
