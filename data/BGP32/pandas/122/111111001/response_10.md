### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy code, the `equals` method is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The method first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances and then proceeds to compare the blocks within them. However, there is a major issue with how the blocks are compared for equality.

The bug arises from the sorting mechanism applied to the blocks before comparing them. The function `canonicalize` is used to generate a sorting key for each block based on its dtype name and manager locations. This sorting is intended to ensure that the block order does not affect the comparison result. However, inside the `canonicalize` function, `mgr_locs` is wrongly accessed as `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block without converting it to a list. The `mgr_locs` attribute should provide a suitable comparison key alongside the dtype name for sorting. By fixing the `canonicalize` function, the comparison of blocks can proceed as intended.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Method
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to return the `mgr_locs` as it is, without converting it to a list, the comparison based on dtype name and manager locations should now work correctly, fixing the bug in the `equals` method.
