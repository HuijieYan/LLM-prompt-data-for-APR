The bug in the `equals` function is related to how the blocks are compared for equality between `self` and `other`. The comparison logic currently sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations before checking for equality. However, the comparison of the manager locations is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly compare the manager locations of the blocks. One way to achieve this is by converting the `mgr_locs` to a list before comparing. This change will ensure that the block manager locations are correctly compared when checking equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mgr_locs` of the blocks are properly compared by converting them to lists before creating tuples for sorting. This modification should address the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly with the failing test case provided.
