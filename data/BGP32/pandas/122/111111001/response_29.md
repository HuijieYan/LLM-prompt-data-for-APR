### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class to determine if they are equal. The function first checks the length of the axes of both instances, then consolidates them in place before comparing their blocks. The comparison of the blocks is done by sorting them based on their type name and manager locations.

The error occurs because the function is not correctly comparing the blocks due to how they are sorted. The function sorts the blocks based on the type name and manager locations but does not compare them accurately during the final step.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. The current implementation sorts the blocks based on the type name and manager locations but fails to compare them effectively during the equality check.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the sorted blocks is done correctly. We can achieve this by comparing each block pair from the sorted lists in a more reliable manner.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare the sorted blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

After making this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks by sorting them based on their type name and manager locations, then comparing them one by one to ensure correct equality checks.
