### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. It checks the equality of axes and blocks between the two objects.
2. The bug is likely in the comparison of blocks within the `equals` function.
3. When executing the failing test, the function fails because it mistakenly returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing `df1` and `df2`.
4. The issue on GitHub points out that the function should return `False` in this case, which implies that the current implementation is incorrect.
5. The comparison logic is flawed in the function, causing it to output incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function needs to be corrected to properly check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal.
2. A possible fix is to reevaluate how the blocks are compared for equality. Instead of comparing the blocks directly, a different comparison approach may be necessary.
3. The function should accurately determine the equality by iterating through the blocks and comparing them appropriately.
4. A strategy would be to compare the blocks element-wise or using another suitable technique based on the block content.
5. By adjusting the comparison approach and ensuring it follows the correct logic, the function can be fixed.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures proper comparison of `BlockManager` objects by addressing the issue in the block equality check.
