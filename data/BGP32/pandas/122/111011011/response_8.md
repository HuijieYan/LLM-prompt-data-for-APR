### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The bug occurs because the function is comparing blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects without considering the order of the blocks in the objects.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two `BlockManager` objects is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. The runtime values show that the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are of the same type but are in different order, leading to the incorrect comparison result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects considers the order of the blocks. 
One approach is to create a sorted list of blocks based on a unique identifier for each block that considers its type and location within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def block_identifier(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, str(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=block_identifier)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=block_identifier)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects will now consider the order based on a unique identifier for each block, ensuring the correct result.
