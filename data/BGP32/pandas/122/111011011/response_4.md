### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class, which compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug appears to be related to comparing blocks in a sorted manner without considering their actual content, leading to incorrect equality checks.
3. The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`. However, due to the sorting approach in the buggy function, it incorrectly returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to compare the content of the blocks directly instead of just sorting them based on their type and locations.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic within the `equals` function to check the equality of blocks based on their actual content instead of sorting them by type and locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

This correction directly compares the blocks' content in both instances, ensuring a proper equality check.

With this fix, the `equals` function should now return the correct result for the failing test case provided.
