### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is supposed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class. It compares the axes and blocks of the two instances for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is resulting in `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The issue from GitHub describes a similar scenario where the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
4. Looking at the runtime values, it is seen that the blocks are sorted by `canonicalize` function which combines dtype name and mgr_locs. The inconsistent sorting criteria can lead to equal blocks being compared in different order, causing the incorrect output.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises due to the inconsistency in sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs. The incorrect sorting order leads to the `equals` function returning `True` when the blocks are actually different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparing them in the `equals` function. The sorting should consider both dtype name and mgr_locs to maintain a reliable order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Ensuring consistent block order by sorting and comparing
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        # Check if the blocks are equal, handling potential inequality
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By sorting the blocks using a consistent `canonicalize` method based on both dtype name and mgr_locs, the corrected function ensures that blocks are compared in a reliable order, fixing the bug that led to incorrect equality comparisons.
