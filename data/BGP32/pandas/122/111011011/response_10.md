### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. It compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes, blocks, and blocks' locations.
2. The bug seems to be caused by the comparison of blocks in two `BlockManager` instances with different locations, resulting in a false equality check.
3. The failing test shows that two DataFrames are considered unequal due to different order of values within the blocks, but the `equals` function incorrectly returns `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when comparing blocks, we consider not just the block content but also their respective locations.
5. I will modify the `equals` function to include block locations in the comparison to ensure correct equality checking.

### To Fix the Bug:
1. Add the block locations to the `canonicalize` function for each block.
2. Update the comparison logic to also consider block locations while checking equality.
3. Return `False` if blocks are not equal in terms of content or location.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock) or block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist() != oblock.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist():
            return False
            
    return True
``` 

This corrected version should now handle the comparison of blocks with the same content but different locations correctly, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
