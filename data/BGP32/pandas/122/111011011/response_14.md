### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas` library. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The code attempts to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but the sorting method might not accurately represent the equality between blocks.
3. The failing test is checking the equality of two dataframes with the "equals" method, where the test expects `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic used for comparing the blocks in the `equals` method.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks. We will change the sorting criteria to consider the actual content of the blocks to determine equality.
2. Instead of comparing dtype name and `mgr_locs`, we will compare the values within each block.
3. This approach will ensure that blocks with the same content are considered equal, regardless of their location or dtype.
4. By updating the comparison logic, we can ensure that the `equals` method correctly identifies differences in block content between the two `BlockManager` objects.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` method:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: b.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: b.values.to_numpy().tobytes())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `equals` method now compares the content of blocks in the `BlockManager` objects to determine equality. This change ensures that the method correctly identifies differences between the blocks and returns the expected result in the failing test case provided in the GitHub issue.
