### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes, blocks, and block order.
2. The buggy function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects and then sorts and compares their blocks.
3. The failing test case provides two DataFrame objects with columns 'a' and 'b' having different data types and values.
4. The error message indicates that the comparison made by `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it erroneously returns `True`.
5. The bug is likely due to the comparison method used after sorting the blocks within the `equals` function.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the sorting of blocks is based on the dtype name and block locations. It doesn't consider the actual values contained in the blocks.
2. The `canonicalize` function in the buggy `equals` implementation sorts blocks only based on dtype and locations, leading to false positives in equality checks.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks based on values instead of just dtype and locations.
2. Ensure that the equality comparison considers the actual values within the blocks for a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block values in addition to dtype and locations, the `equals` function will now accurately compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
