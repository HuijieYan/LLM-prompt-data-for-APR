### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects and the blocks within them for equality. If they have different lengths or any of the axes are not equal, it returns `False`. However, the comparison of blocks is done by sorting them based on their data type name and locations to handle scenarios where unconsolidated blocks might exist.
   
2. The failing test provided compares two dataframes that have columns `'a'` and `'b'` but with different data types in each column. As a result, the `equals` function should return `False` in this case.

3. The error message indicates that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting logic inside the `equals` function when comparing the blocks based on their data type name and locations. Since the data types and locations are different in the provided test case, the comparison fails to identify the differences correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks to consider the actual block data values for comparison instead of just the data type name and locations. This way, identical blocks with different positions will still be considered unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include block data values for comparison
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values along with their locations, the comparison will correctly identify the differences between blocks with different data types and locations, ensuring that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
