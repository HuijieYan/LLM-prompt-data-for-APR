### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The error message suggests that the comparison returned `True` instead of the expected `False`, indicating a bug in the implementation. The issue on GitHub confirms this bug, stating that `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks using a canonicalization process based on dtype and block locations.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect comparison method for equal blocks with different locations. The function fails to account for block locations when checking for equality.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison process to consider both the block contents and their respective locations. This involves revising how the blocks are compared after sorting based on the canonicalization method.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare blocks considering both contents and locations
    return all(
        (block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By enhancing the comparison step to include checking block locations along with block contents, we ensure that the equality comparison accurately considers all necessary factors. This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and resolve the failing test case.
