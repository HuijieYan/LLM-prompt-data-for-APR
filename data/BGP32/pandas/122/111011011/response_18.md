### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of the class for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The issue arises because the method incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations, which should result in `False`.
3. The error message shows that the comparison between two dataframes returns `True` when it should have been `False`, leading to the failing test.
4. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their types and locations to enable a proper comparison.
5. The bug likely stems from the sorting mechanism that does not consider the location of the blocks correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the block's location information in the tuple for proper sorting.
2. This modification ensures that even if the blocks have the same type, they will be distinguished by their locations during comparison.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.to_list())  # Include block location for sorting

    # Sort blocks based on type and location
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Compare sorted blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### With this correction, the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class should now properly compare two instances of the class, considering both type and locations of the blocks for equality. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test now passes.
