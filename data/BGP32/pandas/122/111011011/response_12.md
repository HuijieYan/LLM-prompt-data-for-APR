### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects.
- The error occurs because the function fails to compare the blocks correctly due to different ordering.
- The function sorts the blocks by a combination of data type name and location, but the comparison is made based on the sorted order, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- The error message shows that the comparison results in `True is False`, which indicates the inconsistency in the logic of the function.
- The GitHub issue confirms that the expected output is `False`, indicating a bug in the comparison logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Here are the steps to address the issue:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple combining the data type name and data content to ensure consistent sorting.
2. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` instances using the updated `canonicalize` function.
3. Compare the blocks based on the sorted order.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then block contents to ensure consistent sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.values.to_list())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the changes mentioned above, the function will now compare `BlockManager` objects correctly, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
