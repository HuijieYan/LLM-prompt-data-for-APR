### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks inplace, sorts the blocks using a canonicalization function, and then compares each block for equality.
3. The error message points out that the comparison of the two `BlockManager` objects is returning `True` incorrectly.
4. The input parameters and relevant variables show that the comparison logic is incorrect and is not handling the block comparison accurately.
5. The GitHub issue also highlights the same problem with the `equals` method returning `True` instead of `False`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The bug results in `True` being returned incorrectly when comparing two `BlockManager` objects with blocks having different locations but the same values. The issue is due to blocks being compared in a non-canonical order, leading to incorrect comparisons.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly compare the blocks in a canonical order. This can be achieved by:
1. Canonicalizing the blocks based on type and manager locations.
2. Sorting the blocks using the canonicalization function.
3. Comparing the sorted blocks for equality.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks using the canonicalization function based on type and manager locations, the corrected version ensures that blocks are compared in a consistent and correct order, fixing the bug.
