### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two `BlockManager` objects, the function incorrectly returns `True` even when the blocks have identical values but are located differently in memory.

The bug occurs because the function does not take into account the order of the blocks when comparing them. The comparison is done purely based on the blocks themselves, without considering their actual locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` objects considers both the content of the blocks and their positions in memory. We can achieve this by sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that includes the block type and its memory location before comparing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block dtype and memory location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison now includes sorting the blocks based on their dtype and memory location before checking for equality. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
