### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances, checking if they are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison operation is returning `True` instead of `False` when the two `BlockManager` instances are not equal.
3. The function compares the axes of the two instances and then attempts to compare their blocks. The issue might arise due to an incorrect comparison in the block part.
4. Based on the runtime values provided, the axes comparison seems correct. The issue might be in the block comparison section.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances within the `equals` function. The function compares blocks based on their dtype and location using the `canonicalize` helper function. However, it doesn't correctly handle the case where blocks have the same dtype but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the block comparison logic to account for cases where blocks have the same dtype but different locations. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both dtype and the actual values within the block for a more accurate comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now accurately compare `BlockManager` instances based on both dtype and the actual values within the blocks, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
