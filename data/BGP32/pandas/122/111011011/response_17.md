### Bug Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is meant to check if two BlockManagers are equal. The bug arises when comparing the blocks within the BlockManagers. The issue is related to comparing blocks with the same data but at different positions.


### Error Cause
The bug occurs due to the comparison strategy in the `equals` function. Even if the data in the blocks within two BlockManagers is the same, because they might be organized differently (different manager locations), the comparison fails.


### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the data within the blocks regardless of their manager locations.


### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def get_block_data(block):
        if isinstance(block, ObjectBlock):
            return block.values
        else:
            return block.values.T.flatten()

    self_blocks = [get_block_data(block) for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks = [get_block_data(block) for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks, rather than their positions. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
