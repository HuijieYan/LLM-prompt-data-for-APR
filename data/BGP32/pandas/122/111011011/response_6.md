### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. It compares two instances of `BlockManager` by checking their axes and blocks for equality. The issue arises when comparing the blocks. The comparison mechanism does not consider the potential difference in block order, resulting in incorrect `True` return instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances without considering their order. Since the blocks are sorted differently before the comparison, even if the blocks contain the same data, the inexact order causes the function to return `True` erroneously.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the block comparison should be modified to consider the block order in a consistent way. Sorting the blocks based on a standard criterion (e.g., block index and content) before comparison can ensure accurate equality results.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check for equality while considering block order
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    return True
```

With the revised block comparison mechanism, the `equals` function will accurately determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances considering the block order.

This modification addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function now returns the correct result for the failing test.
