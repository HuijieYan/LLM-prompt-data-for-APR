### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two BlockManager instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The function first compares the lengths of the `axes` of both instances, then checks if all axes are equal using the `equals` method of each axis.
3. After that, it consolidates both instances in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` function and compares the lengths of their `blocks`.
4. Lastly, it sorts and compares each block within the two instances using the `equals` method of the blocks.

### Issue Cause:
1. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
2. The buggy function is not correctly comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances.
3. The block comparison logic using `sorted` and `equals` may return `True` even if the blocks have the same values but different locations, leading to incorrect equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison of blocks considers the equality of values and their positions to avoid false positives in equality checks.
2. Update the block comparison method to account for the block data integrity rather than just the sorted order.
3. Check if the `equals` method of the block object provides the necessary comparison logic. If not, update the comparison logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2) and block1.mgr_locs.equals(block2.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including a comparison of the `mgr_locs` attribute in the `compare_blocks` function, we ensure that not only the content but also the positions of the blocks are considered for equality, addressing the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
