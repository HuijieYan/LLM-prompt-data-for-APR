### Explanation:
The bug in the function `equals` is causing the test to fail. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks. It first checks if the lengths of the axes are different, if so, it returns False. Then, it iterates over the axes and compares them one by one. Next, it consolidates the internal structure of both `BlockManager` objects using `_consolidate_inplace` method, and finally, it compares the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

However, the bug lies in the comparison of blocks. The function is sorting the blocks based on a canonical key generated by combining the dtype name and the locations of the blocks. This can lead to misidentifying blocks as identical even if their content is different but their location in memory is same, resulting in a wrong return value.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared based on their actual values rather than their internal representation. We can achieve this by directly comparing the data within each block to determine their equality. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all((block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By directly comparing the values of the blocks using `(block.values == oblock.values).all()`, we are ensuring that the equality of the `BlockManager` objects is based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their internal representation. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
