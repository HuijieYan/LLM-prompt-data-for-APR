### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method defined in the `BlockManager` class. This method compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The bug is identified when the test `df1.equals(df2) is False` fails and returns `True is False`.
3. From the provided runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the comparison logic is correct, but the issue might arise from the way blocks are being compared.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the incorrect behavior of the `equals` method when dealing with identical blocks with different locations.
5. To fix the bug, the comparison logic and how the blocks are sorted and compared need to be reviewed.

### Fix:
To address the bug and correct the behavior of the `equals` method, we can modify how the blocks are sorted and compared. Instead of just comparing the blocks directly, we can compare their properties more thoroughly to ensure accurate equality checking.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sorting blocks based on dtype and values within blocks
    def sorted_key(block):
        if isinstance(block, (CategoricalBlock, ObjectBlock)):
            return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)
        else:
            return (block.dtype, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sorted_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sorted_key)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This updated version ensures that blocks are sorted based on both dtype and values for categorical or object blocks to account for different locations of identical blocks. This should resolve the issue and make the `equals` method work correctly for comparing `BlockManager` instances.
