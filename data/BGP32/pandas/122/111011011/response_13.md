### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method defined within the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file. The purpose of this function is to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality based on their axes and blocks.

2. Potential error locations can be identified in the comparison of `self_axes` and `other_axes` lengths, the comparison of each axis in the `self_axes` and `other_axes`, consolidation of self and other `BlockManager` instances, and the comparison of blocks in the two instances.

3. The cause of the bug is identified from the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function:
   - The buggy function mistakenly compares the internal blocks of the `BlockManager` instances in a loop without considering the order of blocks. This leads to incorrect outcomes when comparing equal blocks in different locations.

4. To fix the bug, we need to consider the order of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances while comparing. Sorting the blocks based on a canonical key before comparison will ensure that blocks in different locations are correctly identified as equal.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return len(self_blocks) == len(other_blocks) and all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By implementing sorting based on a canonical key before comparison, the corrected function will now correctly identify equal blocks even if they are in different locations within the `BlockManager` instances.
