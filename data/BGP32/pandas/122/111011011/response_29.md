### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. It checks the axes length, the equality of axes labels, consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager`, and then compares the blocks for equality.
   
2. The error message shows an assertion failure when comparing two `DataFrame` objects using the `equals` method, indicating that `True` is being returned when the expected result is `False`.
   
3. Looking at the runtime input/output values, the problem arises from the sorting mechanism used within the `equals` function when comparing blocks. The sorting logic is based on the combination of the dtype name and mgr_locs, which describe the type and location of blocks. However, in the provided execution data, the dtype name and mgr_locs (block's location) are not the actual attributes of the blocks, leading to incorrect block sorting.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a wrong comparison mechanism in the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method. The `canonicalize` function sorts blocks based on attributes (`dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`) that are not present in the blocks' structure.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks based on actual attributes present in the blocks: `dtype` and `items` (locations of blocks within the BlockManager).
2. Modify the sorting logic to use the correct block attributes to ensure consistent block comparison.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.items.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this corrected version, the blocks will be sorted based on actual block attributes, enabling a correct comparison of the `BlockManager` objects. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test as described in the GitHub issue.
