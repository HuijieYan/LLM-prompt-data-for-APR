### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by comparing their axes, blocks, and block locations.
2. The failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but the actual assertion fails, indicating that the buggy function is not handling the comparison correctly.
3. The `equals` function checks if the axes of `self` and `other` are equal, then consolidates both `BlockManager` instances in place, sorts the blocks based on their types and locations, and finally compares each block pairwise.
4. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly sorting and comparing the blocks, leading to `True` being returned instead of `False`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the sorting mechanism used for the blocks in the `equals` function. Since the blocks are sorted based on a tuple of type name and manager locations, if two blocks are identical in content but have different manager locations, they may still be considered equal after sorting.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the blocks as well when determining equality. This can be achieved by taking into account the actual values of the blocks in addition to their type and manager locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should correctly compare the `BlockManager` instances based on the actual content of the blocks, preventing the issue where identical blocks with different locations are incorrectly considered equal.
