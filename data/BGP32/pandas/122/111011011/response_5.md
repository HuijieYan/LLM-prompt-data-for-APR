### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `equals()` function compares two `BlockManager` instances and their blocks for equality.
- **Related Functions**: The function calls `_consolidate_inplace()` to consolidate the blocks before comparison.
- **Error Message**: The test fails because the expected result is `False`, but the function returns `True`.
- **Runtime Input/Output**:
  - The function compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
  - It sorts the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs for canonicalization before comparison.
  - The issue arises because the blocks are sorted differently.
- **GitHub Issue**: The issue reports a discrepancy in the `equals()` function where it should return `False` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the blocks are sorted differently when comparing two `BlockManager` instances, resulting in incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparison to avoid false positives in equality checks.
2. Modify the ordering of blocks for canonicalization to resolve the discrepancy.
3. Verify that the `equals()` function returns `False` as expected for the provided test case.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using dtype name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By consistently sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs for canonicalization before comparison, the corrected function ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as unequal.
