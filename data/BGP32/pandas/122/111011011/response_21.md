### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The comparison involves sorting the blocks based on their data type and manager locations, but it fails to consider the actual values within the blocks.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, which means the equality check is not working as intended.
4. To fix the bug, we need to include a comparison of the actual values within the blocks along with their data types and locations.
5. Providing a corrected version of the `equals` function below to address the bug.

### Fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.values,                 # Include block values in the comparison
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function now includes the actual block values in the comparison, ensuring that the equality check considers all aspects of the blocks. This change should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function work as expected.
