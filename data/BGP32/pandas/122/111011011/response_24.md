### Bug Analysis:
The bug is in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises from comparing blocks in different locations but with identical data content, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` as expected.

The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes, consolidating inplace, comparing the number of blocks, and finally comparing each block in a canonicalized order.

In the failing test scenario provided:
- `df1` and `df2` are two DataFrames with columns 'a' and 'b' but with different data content for each column.
- The `equals` function is expected to return `False` because the data content of `df1` and `df2` is different, hence the DataFrames are not equal.

The runtime values show the comparison between `df1` and `df2`, where the axes and blocks are correctly identified. However, the bug lies in comparing the actual block content without considering the block locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison mechanism for blocks in the `equals` function. Instead of comparing blocks directly, we can consider comparing the block content based on data content across different locations. By introducing a method to match block content correctly, we can address the bug effectively.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Match block content across different locations based on data content
    def match_block_content(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda b: canonicalize(b))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda b: canonicalize(b))
  
    # Compare blocks by matching block content based on data content
    return all(
        match_block_content(block, oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing the `match_block_content` function to compare block content based on data content rather than location, we can ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of DataFrames. This correction should resolve the bug reported in the failing test case.
