### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the function `equals` is comparing the blocks in the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects in a faulty way. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks by their type name and then their memory location, which can lead to incorrect results when the same type of block exists in both `BlockManager` objects but with different memory locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function. Instead of sorting the blocks by type name and memory location, we should compare them directly based on their content. This will ensure that the comparison is accurate regardless of the memory location of the blocks.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block._data.__dict__ == oblock._data.__dict__ for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version compares the blocks directly using their `_data` attributes to ensure that their content is compared rather than their memory location. This approach should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
