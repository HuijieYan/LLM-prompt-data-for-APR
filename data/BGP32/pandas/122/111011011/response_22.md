### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of self and other axes' length can raise an issue if they are not matching.
2. The comparison of each axis of self and other can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly handled.
3. Sorting self and other blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs might produce incorrect results.
4. Comparing each block of self to the corresponding block of other can result in a wrong outcome.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of axes lengths and contents between two BlockManager instances. Additionally, sorting the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs may not guarantee the correct equality check.

The failing test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it's currently returning `True`. This indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the differences between the two BlockManagers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that axes length comparison is accurate.
2. Validate the equality of each axis between self and other.
3. Review the sorting mechanism for blocks to ensure it correctly distinguishes blocks.
4. Confirm the equality check for each block to align with the expected outcome.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By making these changes, we ensure a more accurate comparison between the self and other BlockManagers, considering the axes, blocks, and their contents for equality checks.
