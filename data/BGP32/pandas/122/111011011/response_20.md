### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, consolidating them in place, and then comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager` object.
2. The error message indicates that the test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False` but it is incorrectly returning `True`.
3. Looking at the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, we can see that the blocks are being sorted before comparison based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the sorting mechanism used to compare the blocks, which is not reliable for distinguishing unconsolidated blocks.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the sorting mechanism in such a way that it takes into account the actual content of the blocks, rather than just their dtype and location.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort based on content of blocks, instead of dtype and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the `equals()` function will correctly compare the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects rather than relying solely on block dtype and locations for sorting. This should resolve the issue and make the function return the expected result.
