### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects without considering the order of the blocks. The function sorts the blocks before comparing them, but the sorting mechanism is flawed because it only uses the data type and the locations of the blocks, which might be the same for different blocks that should not be considered equal.

### Potential Issue:
1. The sorting mechanism based on data type and locations can lead to incorrect results for blocks that are actually different.
2. The comparison should consider the content of the blocks rather than just their data type and locations.
3. Since the sorting logic is not sufficient to guarantee correct comparison, it can lead to the function returning `True` incorrectly when the actual content is different.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement a comparison mechanism that considers the content of the blocks, not just their data type and location.
2. Update the sorting mechanism to use a more reliable way to distinguish between blocks, ensuring that identical blocks are always recognized correctly.

### Updated Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the block's values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.to_numpy().tobytes()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this implementation, we're using the actual values of the blocks to create a unique representation for each block, ensuring that identical blocks are correctly compared. This should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and return the expected result for the failing test.
