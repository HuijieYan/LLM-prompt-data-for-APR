### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the `equals` method, which is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error occurs in the test case due to the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method.
3. In the buggy function, it compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks in a sorted order. The bug arises from inconsistent comparison due to sorting based on dtype name and block location.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to correctly calculate the sorting keys for the blocks' comparison.
5. The corrected version of the `equals` method needs to ensure that the block comparison logic accurately checks for equivalency.
  
### Fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on location and block type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs, type(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the `equals` method compares blocks based on both their locations and types, fixing the bug that caused the failing test case.
