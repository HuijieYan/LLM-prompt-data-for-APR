The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing DataFrames with different column types. The bug occurs because the function does not handle cases where the column types are different, leading to a false positive when two DataFrames with different column types are considered equal.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` function to include the column names in the tuple returned. This modification will ensure that the comparison considers both the column types and names when sorting the blocks. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type, name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now handle cases where DataFrames have different column types and return the correct comparison result. The failing test provided should now pass with this corrected version.
