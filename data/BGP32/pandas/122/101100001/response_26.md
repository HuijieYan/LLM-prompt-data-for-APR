## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects using their axes and blocks. The bug occurs due to the incorrect comparison of blocks since the `canonicalize` function is not implemented correctly.

## Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The `mgr_locs` attribute is being accessed as an array, but it should be accessed as a property using `()`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute as a property.
- Update the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the modified `canonicalize` function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    # This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # fixed canonicalize function by accessing mgr_locs as a property
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By correcting the `canonicalize` function and updating the sorting in the `equals` function, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
