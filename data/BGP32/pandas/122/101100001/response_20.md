The bug in the provided function `equals` arises from the comparison between the dataframes `self` and `other` based on their columns. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly determine the equality of the dataframes leading to failing test cases.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Since the bug is in the comparison of the dataframes based on their columns, we need to focus on how these comparisons are made within the function.
2. We need to ensure that the comparison takes into account the values in the dataframes and their positions, not just the column names.
3. Update the comparison logic to compare the values in each block of the dataframe rather than just sorting the blocks by name.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adjusting the comparison logic within the `canonicalize` function to include the block values along with the manager locations, the function now correctly compares the dataframes based on their actual content rather than just their names. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
