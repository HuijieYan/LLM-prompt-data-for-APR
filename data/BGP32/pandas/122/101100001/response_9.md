## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the number of axes in both objects is the same, then it compares each axis using the `equals` method, and finally compares the blocks inside the objects.

## Bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function due to the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly in the `canonicalize` function, leading to an attribute error during sorting.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed within the `canonicalize` function to prevent the attribute error. We should use `block._mgr_locs` instead of `block.mgr_locs` in the `canonicalize` function to access the `_mgr_locs` attribute correctly.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `equals` function, it should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` in the `test_internals.py` file.
