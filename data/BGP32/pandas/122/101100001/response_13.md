## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking the equality of their axes, blocks, and block contents.
2. The function sorts the blocks based on their data type and manager locations to ensure consistent comparison.
3. The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with columns in different order and expects them to be unequal, which is correct.
4. The bug in the `equals` function is due to incorrect comparison of block contents. It fails to compare blocks correctly when the order of columns is different in each `BlockManager`, leading to incorrect equality check.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the use of sorting blocks based on their data type and manager locations without considering the column order in `DataFrame`. This results in incorrect comparison of blocks and wrong equality check.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to consider the order of columns when comparing blocks. By aligning the block order correctly based on column order, we can ensure that the comparison is accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order based on column order
        self_blocks = []
        other_blocks = []
        for i in range(len(self.axes[1])):
            self_blocks.append(self.blocks[self.axes[1][i]])
            other_blocks.append(other.blocks[other.axes[1][i]])

        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks based on the column order, ensuring that the equality check for `BlockManager` instances works as expected. The corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
