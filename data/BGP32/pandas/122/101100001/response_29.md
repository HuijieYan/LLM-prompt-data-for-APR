## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is used to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects.
2. The function compares various attributes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects to determine if they are equal.
3. The function iterates through the blocks of each `BlockManager` object and checks their equality.
4. The bug in the function is likely due to the comparison of blocks not returning the expected result.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when comparing blocks in the `equals` function, leading to incorrect equality evaluation of two `BlockManager` objects.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the equality comparison of blocks is done correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After applying the fix, the `equals` function should correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test.
