The bug in the `equals` function is causing it to incorrectly return True for two dataframes that are not equal. The issue stems from the way the function is comparing blocks within the dataframes. The bug is in the `canonicalize` function where it is using `block.dtype.name` to determine the type of the block. For comparing DataFrames, we need to check the block data directly rather than just the dtype name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block data itself rather than just the dtype name. We can achieve this by creating a tuple with both the dtype name and the block data. By comparing the block data directly, we can accurately determine if two blocks are equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly compare the blocks of the dataframes and return False if they are not equal, passing the provided failing test.
