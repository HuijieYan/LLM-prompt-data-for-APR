## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects and determine if they are equal.
2. The buggy function compares the axes of the two objects, consolidates them in place, and then compares the blocks within the objects.
3. The issue arises in the comparison of blocks where `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and manager locations. However, the data itself is not considered in this comparison, leading to incorrect results.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the data type and the actual data within the blocks.
   
## Proposed Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and data
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._get_values().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this fix, the `canonicalize` function now includes the actual data within the block when sorting, ensuring a more accurate comparison. This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
