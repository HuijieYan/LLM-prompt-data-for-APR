## Correction:

The bug in the provided `equals` function is due to comparing DataFrame objects using a wrong criterion. The DataFrame objects are being compared based on their values which lead to incorrect results because the order of columns matters.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the DataFrames based on the column names before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is based on the structure of the DataFrame rather than the order of its values.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort columns by name before comparison
    self_columns = sorted(self.columns)
    other_columns = sorted(other.columns)
    
    if self_columns != other_columns:
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the DataFrame objects will be sorted by column names before comparison, ensuring that the comparison is done based on the structure of the DataFrame rather than the values. This correction should fix the issue and make the test `test_dataframe_not_equal` pass successfully.
