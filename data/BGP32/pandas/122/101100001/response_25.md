## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks. 
2. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`.
3. It then iterates over the axes using a zip operation and checks if all corresponding axes are equal using the `equals` method of the axis objects.
4. After that, it consolidates both instances in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method.
5. Next, it checks if the number of blocks in both instances are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
6. Finally, it sorts and compares the blocks of both instances using a combination of block type and canonical location.

## Bug:
The bug in the provided function lies in the way it is comparing the contents of the blocks. The issue arises when comparing blocks with different data types, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

## Fix:
One way to fix this bug is to modify the `canonicalize` function to take into account the data type of the block along with its canonical locations for comparison. This change will ensure that blocks with different data types are not mistakenly considered equal.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After making the above changes, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances, taking into account their data types for correct equality comparison.
