## Correction:

The bug in the `equals` function is happening because it is not comparing the actual values in the DataFrames but rather the underlying data structures. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the actual data in the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._comparer,)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Explanation:
- The corrected version of the `equals` function now calls `.values` to compare the actual data within the blocks.
- We use the `==` or `.equals` methods of the pandas objects to compare the values.
- Sorting is done based on the `_comparer` attribute to ensure consistency in block ordering.

After making these corrections, the provided failing test function `test_dataframe_not_equal` should now pass as the corrected `equals` function now correctly compares the DataFrames based on their actual values.
