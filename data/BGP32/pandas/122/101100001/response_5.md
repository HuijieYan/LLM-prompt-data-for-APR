### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `equals` method inside the `BlockManager` class, which is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager`.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, which are being sorted differently for comparison.
- The failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two `DataFrame` instances with different column ordering to assert that `equals` method returns `False`, but it fails because the bug is in the comparison logic in the `equals` method.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` while comparing them in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted in the same way before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using block type and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Updated test:
After applying the corrected version of the `equals` method, the provided failing test should pass as expected.

```python
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    # see GH28839
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```
