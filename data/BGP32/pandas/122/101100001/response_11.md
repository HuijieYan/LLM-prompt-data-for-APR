## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares the axes, consolidates the blocks, and then compares the blocks themselves.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks.
4. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
5. The bug may arise in the comparison of blocks using `equals` method.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the buggy function `equals(self, other)` arises from incorrect comparison of blocks. It fails to correctly compare blocks due to incorrect sorting based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks is done correctly based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This will ensure that the comparison of the blocks is accurate and the function behaves as expected.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

After applying this corrected version to the `BlockManager` class, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within two instances of `BlockManager` and pass the failing test.
