The bug in the `equals` function arises from the way it compares the DataFrames. The function first checks if the axes of the two DataFrames are equal, which is correct. Then it consolidates both DataFrames in place, which could potentially modify the DataFrames. After that, it compares the number of blocks within the DataFrames, which is valid. However, when sorting the blocks, the function uses a key function `canonicalize` that returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, but the `as_array` method call is missing parentheses `as_array.tolist()`. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to call `tolist()` on an object that does not have the `tolist` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the call to `as_array` by adding parentheses. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
