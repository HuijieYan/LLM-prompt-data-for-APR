## Analysis:
The buggy function in this case is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. The purpose of this method is to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.

## Issues:
1. The method is missing the correct signature and implementation to compare two `BlockManager` instances.
2. It needs to check for equality based on the axes, blocks, and other relevant attributes of the `BlockManager` instances.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `equals` function, specifically in comparing the axes and blocks of the `BlockManager` instances. This leads to incorrect equality evaluation between instances.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `equals` method to properly compare the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sort the blocks based on their properties (e.g., dtype name and mgr_locs) to ensure consistent order for comparison.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self._get_axes(), other._get_axes()
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.to_list())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the `equals` method will now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks, passing the failing test provided.
