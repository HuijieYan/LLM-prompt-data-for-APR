The buggy function is `equals` within the `BlockManager` class. The function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their attributes such as axes, blocks, and their locations.

The bug in the current implementation occurs when sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting is incorrectly converting `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array`, which should be `as_array()` instead.

This incorrect conversion results in the bug where the equality check fails due to the comparison of unsorted block locations.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly convert `mgr_locs` to a list using `as_array()` method.
2. Ensure that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is based on the corrected `canonicalize` function.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` provided.
