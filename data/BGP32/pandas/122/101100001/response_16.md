The bug in the provided function BlockManager.equals() is due to the comparison of dataframes without considering the data types. The function is not correctly handling the data types of the columns in the dataframes while checking for equality.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the canonicalize function to also consider the data types of the blocks along with the mgr_locs. This way, when sorting the blocks based on canonicalize, it will take into account both the data type and location of the blocks. This change will ensure that dataframes with different data types in columns are correctly identified as not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function BlockManager.equals():

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # also consider data type in the canonicalization
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the canonicalize function to consider the data type along with the mgr_locs, the function now correctly handles the comparison of dataframes with different data types. The corrected version should pass the failing test test_dataframe_not_equal().
