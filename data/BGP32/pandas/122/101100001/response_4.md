## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is named `equals` and is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The buggy function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then consolidates them in place, and finally compares their blocks.
3. The buggy function fails to compare the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect equality results.
4. The bug is likely due to the way blocks are being compared or sorted before comparison. Ensuring that the blocks are properly compared should fix the issue.

## Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects and pass the failing test.
