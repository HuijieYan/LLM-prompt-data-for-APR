## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals` in the `BlockManager` class, which compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The function compares the axes of the two objects, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks, and finally checks if all blocks are equal.
3. The bug likely occurs when comparing the blocks. In the `canonicalize` function, `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be `block._mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the call to `mgr_locs` so that the locs are retrieved correctly for comparison.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
