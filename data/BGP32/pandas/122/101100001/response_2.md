The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the sorting of blocks based on `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is supposed to create a unique identifier for each block based on its dtype name and mgr_locs values. However, the line `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` should be replaced with `block.mgr_locs.values.tolist()` to access the `values` attribute correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This correction should address the issue with accessing the `values` attribute of `mgr_locs` correctly and ensure that the blocks are sorted based on the unique identifier created by the `canonicalize` function.

After applying this correction, the provided failing test case should pass successfully.
