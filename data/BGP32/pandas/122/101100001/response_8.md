### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The buggy function is comparing the axes, consolidating the objects, and then attempting to compare the blocks within the objects.
3. The bug appears to be in the sorting logic of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` which may not correctly represent the blocks for comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting logic correctly identifies blocks for comparison in a more robust manner.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of relying solely on `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` for sorting, we can potentially flatten the `block.values` to ensure a consistent structure for comparison.
2. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to concatenate the flattened values within the block to create a unique identifier for sorting.
3. By ensuring consistent sorting based on this unique identifier, we can fix the bug in the `equals` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a unique representation of block values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.flatten().tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the corrected version of the function provided above, the bug in the comparison logic based on block sorting should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
