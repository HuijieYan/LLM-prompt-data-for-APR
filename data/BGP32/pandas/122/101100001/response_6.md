## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects. The function first checks if the axes of both objects are of the same length and then proceeds to compare each block of data within the objects.

## Issues:
1. The bug is in the block comparison part of the function where it sorts the blocks of data based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, and then compares each block. This sorting can lead to incorrect results when blocks are not consolidated, as the comparison order may not be consistent.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the sorting mechanism used for blocks can lead to incorrect comparison results if the blocks are not consolidated in a consistent manner. This inconsistency in block order can cause `equals` function to return incorrect results even when the data within blocks is the same.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block comparison is done in a consistent order, regardless of the consolidation state of the blocks. One way to achieve this is by comparing blocks directly without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function now directly compares each block of data in a consistent order, without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. Thus, the function should now pass the failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal()` successfully.
