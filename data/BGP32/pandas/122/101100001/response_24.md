## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is checking for equality between two instances by comparing their axes, blocks, and individual blocks.
2. The reported failing test `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking if two DataFrames with different values are considered not equal by using the `equals` method, which is expected to return `False`.
3. The bug in the current implementation is that the sorting of blocks is not consistent, causing the method to incorrectly return `True` for non-equal DataFrames.
4. The inconsistency in block sorting can lead to comparing different blocks together, giving a false positive equality result.

## Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparing them in the `equals` method.
2. We can sort the blocks based on a unique key that combines the type name and the `mgr_locs` to make the block ordering deterministic and consistent.
3. By sorting the blocks in a consistent manner, we can guarantee that the comparison of blocks between two instances is accurate.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Define a function to create a unique sorting key for blocks
    def key_func(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=key_func)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=key_func)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

After making the above correction, the `equals` method should now sort the blocks consistently based on the unique key before comparing them. This correction should address the bug and make the method return the correct result for the failing test case.
