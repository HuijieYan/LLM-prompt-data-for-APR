The bug in the provided function arises from comparing dataframes with different types in the columns. The bug occurs because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class does not properly handle the comparison of dataframes with different column types, leading to a false equality result.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to account for the case where the column types are different between the two dataframes being compared. We can achieve this by adding an additional check to compare the column names and types before comparing the values.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Check if column names and types are the same
    if self.dtypes != other.dtypes:
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding the check for column names and types before comparing the values, the corrected function will now properly handle the case where dataframes have different column types. This fix will ensure that the `equals` function returns the correct result for dataframes with varying column types.
