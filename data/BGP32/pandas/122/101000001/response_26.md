The bug in the given function is related to the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises due to inconsistencies in sorting the blocks based on their types and locations. This inconsistency leads to false negatives in the comparison.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently across both `BlockManager` instances.
2. We should maintain a stable sorting order for the blocks during comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # Other functions in the class remain the same

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order using a stable sorting key
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.items), block.mgr_locs)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version:
1. We use a stable sorting key in the `canonicalize` function to sort blocks consistently.
2. The sorting key includes the block's data type name, items, and manager locations.
3. By sorting both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on this key, we ensure that they are compared correctly without false negatives.
