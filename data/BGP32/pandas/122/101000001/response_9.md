The bug in the provided function arises due to the comparison of the block order in the self and other BlockManager objects. The comparison relies on the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on data type name and manager locations. However, the `block` and `oblock` objects are not directly comparable using the `equals` function, as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `canonicalize` function to directly compare the blocks using their `equals` method. This way, we can ensure that the comparison is done correctly based on the content of the blocks rather than their attributes.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we compare the blocks directly using their `equals` method within the `canonicalize` function. This change ensures that the comparison is based on the content of the blocks, providing a reliable check for equality between the self and other BlockManager objects.
