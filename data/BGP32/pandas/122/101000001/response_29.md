The bug in the provided `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` class. The issue lies in the comparison of block types and locations, which can lead to incorrect results if the blocks are not in the same order.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared correctly. Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__array_interface__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use `block.get_values().__array_interface__` to extract the values from the block for comparison. This ensures that the blocks are sorted and compared consistently, fixing the bug in the original function.

By making these changes, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` class.
