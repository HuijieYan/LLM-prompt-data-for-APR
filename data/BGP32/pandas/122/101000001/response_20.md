The bug in the provided function is likely to occur due to the comparison of block objects in the `equals` function. When comparing two blocks for equality, the function should compare their contents or data, not the blocks objects themselves.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the data within the blocks instead of the block objects directly. We can achieve this by iterating over the data within each block and comparing them element-wise.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to compare data within blocks for equality
    def compare_block_data(block1, block2):
        return block1.values.equals(block2.values)
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        compare_block_data(block1, block2)
        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

In the corrected version, we compare the values within each block using the `equals` function from the Pandas library. This ensures that we are comparing the actual data contents of the blocks rather than the block objects themselves.
