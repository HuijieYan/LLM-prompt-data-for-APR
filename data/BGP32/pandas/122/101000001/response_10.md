The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison of blocks. The function is trying to compare whether the blocks in `self` and `other` are equal by sorting them based on their data types and memory locations. However, the `equals` method of the blocks is being called without checking if the blocks are of the same type before comparing them. This can lead to a comparison between different types of blocks, resulting in an error.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the blocks are of the same type before comparing them. We can do this by adding a condition to compare the types of the blocks before calling the `equals` method on them.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        isinstance(block, type(oblock)) and block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, before comparing the blocks using the `equals` method, we first check if the blocks are of the same type using the `isinstance` function. This ensures that only blocks of the same type are compared, preventing errors that could occur due to comparing different types of blocks.
