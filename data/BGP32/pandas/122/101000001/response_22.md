The bug in the provided function lies in the comparison of the block's data between two instances of the `BlockManager` class. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function is not called properly within the `equals` function.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function is used correctly to compare the blocks' data. We should call the `canonicalize` function on each block before comparing them in the `all` function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Corrected canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have added `()` to the `as_array` method call (`block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist()`) and ensure that the `canonicalize` function is called correctly during sorting and comparison of the blocks. This should fix the bug in the function.
