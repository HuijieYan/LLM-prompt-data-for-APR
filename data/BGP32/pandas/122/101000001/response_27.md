The buggy function in the `BlockManager` class is the second `equals` function. The issue with this function is that it is redefining the `equals` method, which was already defined earlier in the class. This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug:
1. Remove the redefinition of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class to avoid conflicts with the method that was defined earlier in the class.
2. Ensure that the logic within the redefined `equals` method is placed in a separate method or combine it with the existing `equals` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `BlockManager` class without the buggy `equals` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def _consolidate_inplace(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This is the original equals function in the class
    def equals(self, other):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
```

By removing the buggy redefined `equals` method from the `BlockManager` class, the potential conflict and confusion are avoided. The existing `equals` method in the class can be used for the desired functionality without any issues.
