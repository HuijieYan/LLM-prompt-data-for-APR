The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. The function aims to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their attributes. 

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The comparison of the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` may not be accurate if the axes are not in the same order in both instances.
2. The sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function may not work correctly due to potential differences in the ordering of blocks.

The cause of the bug stems from the assumption that comparing the lengths of axes and blocks directly can determine equality, which may not hold true in all cases due to variations in the order of axes and blocks.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to implement a more robust comparison method that considers the actual content of the axes and blocks rather than just their lengths and order. By deep diving into the equality comparison of axes and blocks, ensuring that the comparison considers all relevant attributes and metadata associated with them, a more accurate equality check can be performed.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def sort_key(block):
        return (block.values.data.nbytes, block.values.data.tobytes())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, each axis is individually compared to ensure proper equality. Additionally, the sorting of blocks is done based on a more comprehensive `sort_key` function to account for variations in block content. This approach enhances the accuracy of the equality check between two instances of `BlockManager`.
