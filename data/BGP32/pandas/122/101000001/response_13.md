The bug in the provided function lies in the way the blocks are sorted and compared for equality. The current implementation is sorting the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, which may not provide a consistent order for comparison.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider additional factors that uniquely identify each block.
2. We should include the actual block data in the sorting criteria to ensure a correct comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tostring())  # Include block data in sorting

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have included `block.values.tostring()` in the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the actual block data is considered during sorting. This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the blocks are compared correctly for equality.
