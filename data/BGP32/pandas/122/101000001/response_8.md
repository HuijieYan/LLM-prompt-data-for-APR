The bug in the provided function `equals` lies in the way the blocks are compared between `self` and `other`. The bug occurs because the blocks are sorted using `canonicalize` function, which sorts them based on the `dtype.name` and the `mgr_locs` of the blocks. This sorting might cause inconsistencies in the comparisons, especially if the blocks have the same type name and manager locations.

To fix the bug, we need to consider a more robust way of comparing the blocks. One possible solution is to compare the blocks directly based on their content. We can achieve this by iterating over each block in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` simultaneously and directly comparing them using the `equals` function provided. This way, we can ensure that the content of the blocks is compared accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # compare blocks directly based on content
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By comparing the blocks directly based on their content using the `equals` function provided, we ensure a more accurate comparison. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as intended.
