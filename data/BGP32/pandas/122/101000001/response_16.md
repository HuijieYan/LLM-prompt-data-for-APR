The bug in the provided function `equals` lies in the way it compares the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManager instances. The bug occurs when sorting the blocks using the `canonicalize` function, which compares the data types and manager locations of the blocks. 

The issue arises because the `as_array` method is being incorrectly accessed on `block.mgr_locs`, resulting in a `AttributeError`. The correct method to access the array representation of `mgr_locs` is `tolist()`, not `as_array.tolist()`.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the `canonicalize` function by updating the syntax to access the array representation correctly. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By fixing the `canonicalize` function to correctly access the array representation of `mgr_locs`, the bug in the `equals` function will be resolved, and the function will compare the BlockManager instances accurately.
