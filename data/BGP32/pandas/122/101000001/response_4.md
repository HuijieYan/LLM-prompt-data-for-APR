The bug in the provided function is due to the use of the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` methods. These methods are called before comparing the number of blocks in `self` and `other`, leading to an incorrect comparison if the two block managers are not already consolidated.

To fix this bug, the consolidation should be done before comparing the number of blocks. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Consolidate the block managers before comparison
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this modification, the consolidation of block managers is performed before comparing the number of blocks, ensuring that the comparison is correct even if the block managers were not consolidated initially.
