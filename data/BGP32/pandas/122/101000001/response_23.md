The bug in the given function `equals` is caused by the fact that the `canonicalize` function is attempting to call the `mgr_locs` attribute as an array and then a list, which is not the correct way to access the locations of blocks. This results in an AttributeError as the `mgr_locs` attribute does not have a `as_array` method.

To fix this bug, we need to access the `mgr_locs` attribute correctly to get the locations of the blocks. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using block type name and mgr_locs for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, we have fixed the bug by correctly accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block object without calling it as an array or a list. This should resolve the AttributeError and the function should now work as intended.
