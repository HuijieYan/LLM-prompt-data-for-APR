### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class compares two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The function checks the equality of `self.axes` and `other.axes`, then consolidates both instances in place.
3. It then compares the number of blocks in each instance and sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` before finally comparing each block for equality.

### Bug:
The bug in the given function arises from the fact that the comparison between blocks is done by sorting them using the `canonicalize` function and then comparing them sequentially. This approach can lead to incorrect results if the blocks are not sorted in the same order in each instance.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the order of blocks is consistent across both instances before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version directly compares each block in the same order, without sorting the blocks separately during the comparison.
