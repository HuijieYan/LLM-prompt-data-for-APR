## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two objects and check if they are equal based on specific conditions. The function compares the axes, consolidates the objects in place, and then compares the individual blocks within the objects. However, there is a potential bug in the function that may lead to incorrect comparison results.

## Bug Description:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to create tuples for sorting, but the `mgr_locs` attribute might not be available for all types of blocks. This can lead to errors during comparison and incorrect results.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks does not depend on attributes that might not be present for all types of blocks. Instead of relying on `mgr_locs`, we can consider using a different approach to sort and compare the blocks effectively.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.dtype.name)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the sorting criteria in `canonicalize` function with `block.dtype.name` for both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. This change ensures that the comparison of blocks is consistent and does not depend on attributes that might not be present for all blocks.
