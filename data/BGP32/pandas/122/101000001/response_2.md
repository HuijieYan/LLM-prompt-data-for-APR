The bug in the provided code stems from the fact that the `canonicalize` function is attempting to access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block object, which is not defined. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to call `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle the block objects without the `mgr_locs` attribute. One way to do this is to check if the attribute exists before trying to access it. If the attribute exists, then use it for canonicalization; otherwise, use a default value that allows comparison between the blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and block contents
    def canonicalize(block):
        if hasattr(block, 'mgr_locs'):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function checks if the `mgr_locs` attribute exists in the block. If the attribute is present, it uses it for canonicalization; otherwise, it falls back to using the block values directly. This modification ensures that the comparison between the blocks is done correctly and prevents the AttributeError from occurring.
