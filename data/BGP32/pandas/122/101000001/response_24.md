The buggy function is the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class. This function is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks. However, the bug occurs when trying to compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, as it does not handle the case when the number of blocks is different between the two objects.

The bug arises when comparing the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` directly without ensuring that the number of blocks is the same for both objects. If the number of blocks is different, the function should return `False` immediately, as the objects cannot be considered equal.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to compare the lengths of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` before attempting to iterate over them. If the lengths are different, we return `False` immediately. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By adding the check for the length of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, the function will now handle cases where the number of blocks is different between the two `BlockManager` objects and return `False` as expected.
