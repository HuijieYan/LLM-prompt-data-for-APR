## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` objects based on their attributes. The function aims to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and content. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

## Identification of Potential Error:
The bug might be caused by the comparison of blocks without considering their order or handling unconsolidated blocks appropriately. The sorting based on `canonicalize` function might not be correctly identifying equivalent blocks.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. There is a possibility that the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on `canonicalize` function may not accurately reflect the equality between the blocks.
2. Unconsolidated blocks might not be handled properly during the comparison, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement a more robust comparison logic that takes into account the equality of blocks based on their content and not just their order or other attributes.
2. Ensure proper handling of unconsolidated blocks during the comparison to avoid false negatives in the equality check.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Create sets of blocks for efficient comparison
    self_block_set = set([(block.dtype.name, block.to_list()) for block in self.blocks])
    other_block_set = set([(block.dtype.name, block.to_list()) for block in other.blocks])

    return self_block_set == other_block_set
```

In the corrected version, I have replaced the sorting mechanism with creating sets of blocks based on their content. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual block data and not on their order. The equality check now compares the block sets directly to determine if the `BlockManager` instances are equal. Additionally, it is essential to ensure proper handling of unconsolidated blocks within the comparison logic.
