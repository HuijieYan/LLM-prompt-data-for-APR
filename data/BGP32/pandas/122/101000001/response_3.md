## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions:

The buggy function is supposed to check if two BlockManager instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The function iterates over the axes and blocks of each BlockManager, checks their lengths, compares the axes, consolidates the blocks in place, and then compares the blocks using a canonicalization process.

The related `equals` function in the BlockManager class is calling other functions, `_consolidate_inplace` and `as_array`, which are internal helper functions.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. Comparison of axes length might be incorrect.
2. Comparison of axes content using the `equals` method could lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Block consolidation in place might not handle all corner cases, affecting the comparison.
4. Sorting and canonicalization of blocks could introduce a bug if done incorrectly.

## Explaining the cause of the bug:

The bug in the `equals` function could arise from incorrect comparisons of axes length, improper comparison of axes, issues with block consolidation, or errors in sorting and canonicalization of blocks. Any of these errors could cause the function to return incorrect results when checking the equality of two BlockManager instances.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the comparison of axes length is accurate and handles corner cases.
2. Verify that the comparison of axes content is done correctly, possibly by checking for equality in a more robust way.
3. Confirm that block consolidation in place is thorough and covers all necessary scenarios.
4. Review the sorting and canonicalization process for blocks to detect and fix any bugs related to their comparison.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: hash(block))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: hash(block))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with the original implementation, such as improved block sorting using hashing to ensure consistent ordering and comparison. Additionally, it retains the logic to compare axes and perform block consolidation to ensure a valid equality check between two BlockManager instances.
