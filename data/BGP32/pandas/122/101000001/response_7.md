The bug in the provided function arises from the fact that the `canonicalize` function is referencing `mgr_locs` attribute of the `block` objects, which does not exist. This leads to an AttributeError when trying to access `mgr_locs`.

To fix this bug, you should modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle `block` objects and extract the necessary information for comparison. Since `mgr_locs` does not exist in the blocks, we can modify `canonicalize` to include the block's `dtype` and its values.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order by including dtype and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.dtype)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should work correctly and compare the blocks based on their values and data types.
