## Analysis:
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances (`self` and `other`) of the same class. The function first checks if the lengths of the axes in `self` and `other` are equal. Then, it iterates over the axes and checks equality of each pair. Next, it consolidates the instances in place before comparing the number of blocks they contain. Finally, it attempts to canonicalize the blocks based on data type name and manager locations, sorting them, and then comparing each block pair for equality.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison of axis lengths `len(self_axes) != len(other_axes)` could lead to a false negative if the axes are unordered or not cleaned properly.
2. Sorting the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function might not provide the correct order for comparison.
3. The comparison of blocks at the end could fail if the sorting logic is incorrect or inconsistent.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the current implementation is likely due to the incorrect sorting strategy for blocks based on `canonicalize` function. If the `canonicalize` function does not consistently produce a unique and correct sorting order for the blocks, the equality comparison may fail even if the blocks are essentially the same.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting logic in the `canonicalize` function generates a reliable and consistent order for the blocks. This can be achieved by considering more attributes or properties of the blocks that uniquely identify them. Additionally, we should verify that the axes comparison and consolidation steps are valid and do not introduce errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Custom ordering function for blocks
    def order_blocks(block):
        return (block._typ, block._id)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=order_blocks)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=order_blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- The `order_blocks` function generates a unique sorting order based on the block type and identifier.
- This ensures a consistent and reliable sorting order for comparing blocks.
- The axes comparison and block consolidation steps remain intact to provide a valid comparison of the instances.

By implementing these changes, the buggy function `equals` should now correctly compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
