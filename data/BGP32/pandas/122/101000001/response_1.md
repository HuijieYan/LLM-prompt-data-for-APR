In the provided buggy function, the issue seems to arise from the way the `canonicalize` function is defined. The `canonicalize` function should be accessing the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks, but it is incorrectly using the method syntax `.as_array.tolist()` instead of accessing the attribute directly.

To fix this bug, you need to update the `canonicalize` function in the `equals` method as follows:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
```

By making this change, you ensure that the `mgr_locs` attribute is correctly accessed without calling any methods on it. This should resolve the bug in the `equals` method.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the fix included:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now work correctly without causing any errors related to the incorrect usage of the `mgr_locs` attribute.
