The bug in the provided function is likely to occur due to an incorrect comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are lists that contain block objects, and the comparison needs to be done on these individual block objects.

To fix the bug, we need to iterate over the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, compare each block object, and ensure that they are equal. The current implementation compares the entire lists of blocks directly, which may lead to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Check equality of each block in self_blocks and other_blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, each block from `self_blocks` is compared with the corresponding block from `other_blocks`. If at any point the blocks are not equal, the function will return `False`. If all blocks are equal, the function will return `True`.
