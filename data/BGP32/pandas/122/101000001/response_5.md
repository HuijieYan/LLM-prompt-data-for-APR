The bug in the provided function arises from the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function should be applied to the blocks before calling the `sorted` function to ensure consistent comparison. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to account for the actual block contents properly. We need to extract essential properties of the blocks that determine their equality and compare them correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `canonicalize` function and the buggy function:

```python
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.values, block.index, block.dtype)

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now properly extracts essential properties (`block.values`, `block.index`, `block.dtype`) that are crucial for comparing and sorting the blocks. This modification ensures a correct comparison and sorting of blocks in the `equals` function, resolving the bug.
