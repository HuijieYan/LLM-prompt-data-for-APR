### Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two BlockManager instances by first checking the length of their axes, then comparing each axis, and finally sorting and comparing the blocks based on their types and locations.
- The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`, leading to a failing assertion in the test case.
- The expected input includes two DataFrame instances `df1` and `df2` with columns swapped, which should result in the `equals` function returning `False`.
- The GitHub issue indicates that the function is failing to return the expected output in cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations.

### Error Location:
- The bug might be in the comparison of the blocks. If the blocks have identical contents but different locations, the comparison may fail.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug likely stems from the sorting and comparison of the blocks based on their types and locations. If two blocks have identical values but different locations, the comparison will incorrectly return `True`.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the comparison logic to consider the actual content of the blocks rather than just their types and locations. This change should ensure that blocks with the same contents are considered equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return tuple(block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version uses the actual content of the blocks to compare them, ensuring that blocks with identical values are correctly identified as equal.
