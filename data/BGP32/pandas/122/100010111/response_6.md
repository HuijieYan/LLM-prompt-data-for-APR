### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects containing blocks of different data types (int64 and object). It sorts the blocks based on their data type and locations before comparing them.
2. The failing test is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return False since the data types and values in the dataframes don't match. However, the buggy function is incorrectly returning True.
3. The bug occurs because the function is not comparing the blocks correctly due to the sorting method used based on data type and locations.
4. To fix the bug, we should compare the blocks directly without sorting since the ordering should not impact the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to compare the blocks directly without sorting them based on data type and locations.
2. Remove the `canonicalize` function and the sorting of blocks.
3. Update the return statement to directly compare the blocks without any sorting involved.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    # Compare the axes of both BlockManagers
    if len(self.axes) != len(other.axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self.axes, other.axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare the number of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # Compare each block in both BlockManagers without sorting
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly compare the blocks in the BlockManagers without sorting them based on data types and locations. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
