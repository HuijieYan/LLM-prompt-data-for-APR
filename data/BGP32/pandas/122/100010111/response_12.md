### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects in the `pandas` library.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` unexpectedly when it should return `False`.
3. The function compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects, then sorts and compares the blocks within them. The issue may arise from how the blocks are being sorted or compared.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and that the function returns the appropriate boolean value based on their equality.
5. The GitHub issue provides information about a specific test case that fails due to this bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to correctly identify and order the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` values.
2. Compare the sorted blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` to determine if they are equal.
3. Modify the function to return `False` if any of the comparisons fail.

### Correction:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly comparing and sorting the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects before determining their equality.
