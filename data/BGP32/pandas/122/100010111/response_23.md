### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, then it proceeds to compare the content of both `self_axes` and `other_axes`. Following that, it consolidates the blocks within `self` and `other` instances and continues to compare the length of blocks. Finally, it iterates over the blocks using a canonicalized order and checks if each block is equal in both instances.

### Identified issue:
The issue arises from comparing the dataframes `df1` and `df2` in the failing test case. The comparison is expected to return `False` since the data in `df1` and `df2` is not the same. However, the buggy function returns `True` instead.

### Bug cause:
1. The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison logic in the buggy function.
2. Even if the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` have different values in their blocks, the buggy function does not account for this in its comparison. It compares the blocks using the canonicalized order, which leads to incorrect results.
3. Due to these issues, the `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` assertion fails.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. The comparison logic should be updated to directly compare the blocks between `self` and `other` instances without using canonicalized order.
2. Each block within `self` and `other` should be compared directly to check for equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Now the corrected function directly compares the blocks within `self` and `other` instances, ensuring a proper comparison for equality. This should resolve the issue stated in the GitHub post and pass the failing test case.
