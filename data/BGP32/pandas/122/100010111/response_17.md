### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
- The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.
- The function compares the axes of `self` and `other` BlockManagers, the lengths of their blocks, and then iterates over the blocks to check if they are equal.
- The error arises from comparing blocks inconsistently due to different locations of identical blocks.
- The GitHub issue also highlights this bug and provides an expected output of `False`.
  
### Issue:
The bug is causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly when comparing two BlockManagers with identical blocks but different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks' equality comparison does not get affected by their locations. We can achieve this by comparing the blocks regardless of their locations while considering their dtype names.
  
### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in self.blocks}
    other_blocks = {canonicalize(block): block for block in other.blocks}

    if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
        return False

    for key in self_blocks.keys():
        if not self_blocks[key].equals(other_blocks[key]):
            return False

    return True
```

### Explanation:
1. Modified the `canonicalize` function to return only the dtype name of the block.
2. Created dictionaries `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` with dtype names as keys and blocks as values to avoid considering block locations.
3. Checked if the sets of keys in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are equal to ensure all unique blocks are present in both BlockManagers.
4. Compared the blocks for each shared dtype name, ensuring the blocks are equal regardless of their locations.
