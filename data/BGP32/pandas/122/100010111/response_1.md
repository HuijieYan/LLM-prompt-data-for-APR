### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two block managers by their axes, blocks, and block contents.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, meaning the function returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
3. The expected values and types provided indicate the correct comparison of axes and blocks.
4. The error is likely due to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` not considering the block order.
5. The GitHub issue details a similar problem where identical blocks with different locations were incorrectly evaluated as equal.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the block order in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` correctly when comparing them for equality. This leads to incorrect evaluation of dataframe equality.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a canonicalized key that includes the block type and location. This ensures that the function compares identical blocks correctly, regardless of their original order in the block manager.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly compare blocks within the block manager, considering their types and locations. This should resolve the issue with `equals` wrongly returning True when blocks have different locations.
