### Analysis:
- The buggy function compares two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes are the same, and then sorts and compares their blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs.
- The error message shows that the assertion failed with `assert True is False`, indicating that the buggy function returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.
- The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are provided to guide us in correcting the function.
- The GitHub issue highlighted a discrepancy in the `DataFrame.equals()` function's behavior, leading to incorrect return values.

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the buggy function, the comparison logic for the blocks is incorrect. It relies on sorting and comparing blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which can lead to issues when the location of the blocks is different.
- The expected input/output values show the correct structure that the function should maintain, which the buggy function fails to do.
- The GitHub issue further confirms that the `DataFrame.equals()` function wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks at different locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to adjust the comparison logic for the blocks to ensure that even if the blocks are in different locations, they are considered equal if their contents are the same.
- Instead of relying solely on dtype name and mgr_locs for sorting and comparison, we should compare the actual contents of the blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks directly to ensure equality
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
        
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks for equality without relying on sorting based on dtype and locations, the corrected version of the function should now return the correct results and pass the failing test.
