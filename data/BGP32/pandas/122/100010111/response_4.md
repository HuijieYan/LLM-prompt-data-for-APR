### Analyzing the buggy function

1. **Error Message**: The error message states that the assertion `True is False` failed. This indicates that the function `equals` is returning `True` incorrectly when it should return `False`.
   
2. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - The function `equals` receives two instances of `BlockManager` as `self` and `other`. It compares the axes and blocks of these instances to determine equality.
   - The expected output is `False` when the axes or blocks are not equal.

3. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue reports that the function `DataFrame.equals()` is returning `True` incorrectly for specific cases where the blocks have identical values but different locations.

### Potential Error Locations

1. Comparing axes lengths without considering their contents.
2. Sorting and comparing the blocks based on block order which might cause issues with unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Cause and Strategy for Fixing

The bug is likely caused by how the blocks are sorted and compared. If blocks are identical but have different locations, they should not be considered equal. To fix this, we need to ensure a more robust comparison based on block values rather than just locations.

A strategy for fixing this bug would be to modify the sorting mechanism to account for block values instead of just locations during comparison. This way, blocks with identical values but different locations will still be considered equal.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.mgr_locs)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version includes sorting blocks based on their locations using `mgr_locs` to ensure identical values are correctly compared even if they have different locations. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
