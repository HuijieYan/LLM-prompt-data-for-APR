### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes and blocks are equal. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Error Location
The bug is likely occurring in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks before comparison. This sorting based on dtype name and `mgr_locs` might not be handling the comparison properly.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the sorting function `canonicalize` not taking into account the actual values inside the blocks but rather focusing on the dtype and the block locations. This can lead to identical blocks being sorted differently, resulting in a false positive comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted based on their content values rather than just the dtype name and block locations. By considering the content of the blocks, the function can accurately determine if the DataFrames are equal.

### Code Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks based on their content values using `block.values`. This change ensures that the comparison between DataFrames considers the actual data within the blocks rather than just the data type and block locations.
