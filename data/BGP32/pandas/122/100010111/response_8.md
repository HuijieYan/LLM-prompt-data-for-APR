### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is meant to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` incorrectly.
3. The bug is occurring because the function is comparing the blocks in a way that does not account for differences in block locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider block locations in addition to block type.
5. The corrected version needs to account for block locations properly to ensure accurate DataFrame comparison.

### Correction:
```python
# Corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function to consider block type and block location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.block)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By revising the `canonicalize` function to also include the block location information, the comparison between blocks will now correctly account for different block positions, resolving the issue leading to incorrect results in DataFrame comparison.
