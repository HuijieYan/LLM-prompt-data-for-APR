### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The expected values for the input parameters and the expected behavior of the function have been provided.
4. The bug is likely related to how the blocks are being compared in the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `canonicalize` function not correctly distinguishing blocks based on the type name and manager locations. Due to this, identical blocks with different locations are considered equal, leading to the incorrect return value of `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to improve the `canonicalize` function so that it considers both the type name and the manager locations of blocks for accurately distinguishing them.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and the manager locations of blocks to distinguish them
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to use both the type name of the block and its manager locations for comparison, the corrected function should now be able to distinguish between identical blocks with different locations and return the correct result.
