### Analysis:
#### Issue:
The buggy function `equals` is not handling the comparison between two DataFrames correctly. In the failing test case, the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` is expected to return `False` because they have different values in corresponding positions. However, the buggy function is incorrectly returning `True`, leading to the test failure.

#### Bugs:
1. The bug occurs when comparing the `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` in the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The blocks are not properly matched.
2. The function is not correctly comparing the `self` and `other` DataFrames.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is primarily due to incorrect handling of block alignment and comparison. The `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks is not effectively distinguishing between blocks with the same values but different locations. This leads to incorrect equality checks between blocks.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct alignment and comparison of blocks by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider all relevant block attributes for differentiation.
2. Implement a robust comparison logic for ensuring the correct equality check between two DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare each block in a DataFrame after sorting them based on relevant attributes
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), str(block.mgr_locs)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (str(type(block)), str(block.mgr_locs)))

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if str(type(block)) != str(type(oblock)) or str(block.mgr_locs) != str(oblock.mgr_locs):
            return False
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

With the corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison between two DataFrames should now correctly handle the equality check for the blocks and return the expected `False` for the failing test case.
