### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `equals` method from the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas/core/internals/managers.py` file.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed with `assert True is False`.
3. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances, ensuring the axes are equal, consolidates the blocks, and compares the blocks with a canonicalized order.
4. The bug seems to lie in how the blocks are compared and ordered, leading to a false assertion when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
5. To fix the bug, the comparison logic for blocks needs to be adjusted to handle cases where identical blocks may have different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the comparison logic for blocks in the `equals` method. When sorting and comparing blocks for equality, the method only compares based on the block type and location. However, this does not account for cases where identical blocks are placed at different locations, leading to a false positive in the equality check.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the elements of each block as well. We should sort the blocks using a combination of block type, location, and values within the block. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly handled during the comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering block type, location, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method now includes the block values in the sorting process. By considering block values along with type and location, the method correctly handles cases where identical blocks may be located at different positions.
