### Analysis:
1. The `equals` method in the buggy function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks if the axes of both instances have the same length, and then proceeds to sort and compare their blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. It suggests that the comparison returned `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug seems to stem from the way the function compares blocks within the `BlockManager`. It might be comparing them incorrectly due to a mismatch in the block order or location.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly and that any difference in their order or location is taken into account.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Check for equality in the blocks
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By explicitly iterating over the sorted blocks of both `self` and `other`, the corrected version ensures that each block is correctly compared before returning the final result.
This correction should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected output.
