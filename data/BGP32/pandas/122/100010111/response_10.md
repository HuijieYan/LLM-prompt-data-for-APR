### Analysis:
1. The function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing their blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, meaning the function is returning `True` when comparing `df1` and `df2`.
3. The expected input/output values provided for the failing test show the expected values of relevant variables before the return of the function. There seems to be an issue with the comparison of `df1` and `df2` blocks.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the false result returned by `equals` method when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.
5. The issue seems to arise from the sorting of blocks based on type name and manager locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not incorrectly marked as equal.
2. The strategy would involve modifying the way blocks are compared and ensuring that the comparison considers the actual values within the blocks rather than just sorting based on type and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Update:
The corrected version above modifies the comparison of blocks directly without sorting them based on type and locations. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual values within the blocks, preventing the false equality issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
