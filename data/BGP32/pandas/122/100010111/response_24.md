### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`, which is unexpected. This issue has been reported on GitHub with the title "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations".

### Identified issue:
The issue seems to arise from the way blocks are sorted in the `canonicalize` function. The comparison between blocks should be based on their content rather than their locations. Due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations, the `equals` method is incorrectly returning `True`.  

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to return the actual content (values) of the blocks for comparison instead of their locations.
2. Update the comparison in the `equals` method to compare the sorted blocks based on their content.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare blocks based on their content, not their locations
    def canonicalize_data(block):
        return block.values.tolist()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize_data)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize_data)
    
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to extract the block values for comparison, the corrected `equals` method will now correctly check the equality of blocks based on their content. This modification should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
