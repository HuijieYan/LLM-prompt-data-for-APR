### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `assert` statement in the test is failing. The function in question is `equals` which is used to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. The issue reported on GitHub points out that the function wrongly returns `True` even when the blocks have different locations.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect comparison logic within the function.
2. Sorting of blocks based on block properties might not be effective.

### Bug Explanation:
The `equals` function is currently comparing the blocks in `self` and `other` based on block properties such as dtype and mgr_locs. However, the bug arises when the locations of blocks are different but the actual content is identical, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`. This is why the test fails with the assertion error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the actual content of the blocks in addition to their properties. This way, even if the blocks are located differently, the function will correctly return `False` if the actual content differs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    block_comp = [block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)]
    
    return all(block_comp) and len(block_comp) == len(self.blocks)
```

This corrected version of the function now ensures that the comparison is done based on the content of the blocks in addition to their properties. This change should address the bug and make the function return the expected outcomes as per the GitHub issue.
