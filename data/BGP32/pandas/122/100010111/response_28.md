### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two BlockManagers for equality based on various conditions.
2. The error message indicates that the test is failing because the function is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The expected input values are BlockManagers for both `self` and `other`, along with their axes and blocks. The expected output is a boolean indicating whether the BlockManagers are equal.
4. The cause of the bug might be related to how the function is comparing the blocks within the BlockManagers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the comparison of blocks in the BlockManagers. The function sorts the blocks based on `canonicalize` which uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This sorting may not be handling the case where blocks have different locations even if their content is the same.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic of the blocks should be improved to handle cases where the blocks have identical content but different locations. This may involve a more sophisticated comparison mechanism for the blocks.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Function to compare two blocks for equality
    def compare_blocks(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2)

    # Iterate over the blocks and compare them for equality
    return all(
        compare_blocks(block, oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

This updated version provides a new function `compare_blocks` to compare two blocks directly for equality. This change will enhance the block comparison mechanism and resolve the issue of returning `True` instead of `False` in the failing test.
