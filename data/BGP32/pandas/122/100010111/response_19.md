### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `managers.py` file is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` objects are equal. It compares the axes, consolidates them, compares the number of blocks, and then iterates over each block to check if they are equal.
   
2. The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is failing with the comparison `True is False`. This shows that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be `False`.
   
3. Based on the expected values provided, the bug seems to be related to incorrect comparison of blocks due to potentially different locations but similar contents. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` instead of `False`. The issue on GitHub also confirms this expectation.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the comparison between blocks without considering their locations. When two blocks have the same content but different locations, the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider both the dtype and the locations of the blocks. By ensuring that blocks with similar content but different locations are not incorrectly considered equal, the function should return the correct result.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the location information of the blocks and updating the comparison logic in the final return statement, the corrected function should now handle the comparison correctly and pass the failing test case.
