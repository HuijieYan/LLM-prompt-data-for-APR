### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is supposed to check if two BlockManagers are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. 
2. The error message indicates that there is a failure when comparing two DataFrames, which should result in False. However, the assertion fails because it is checking if True is False.
3. The bug seems to stem from how the comparison logic is implemented, specifically in how it handles the DataFrame blocks.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between the two DataFrames is done correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the comparison of the DataFrame blocks. The function incorrectly sorts and compares the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, leading to the incorrect comparison of the DataFrames. This causes the function to return True when it should return False.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic of comparing the blocks between the two DataFrames to accurately determine equality.
2. Consider revising the way blocks are sorted and compared to prevent the current issue.
3. Ensure that the comparison process correctly handles the blocks and specifically considers the values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on block items and values
    def canonicalize_blocks(blocks):
        return [(block.items, block.values) for block in blocks]

    self_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_blocks(other.blocks)

    return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

By updating the comparison logic to consider the items and values of the blocks directly, the corrected function should now accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal. This approach should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug while passing the failing test.
