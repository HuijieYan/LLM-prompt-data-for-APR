### Explanation:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises due to the incorrect comparison of columns in the DataFrames. The function sorts the blocks inside each `BlockManager` instance based on `canonicalize` function, which combines the block's data type name and location. However, this sorting does not consider the order of the columns within the DataFrames.

In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same columns 'a' and 'b', but the order is different, which leads to the function returning `True`, causing the assertion error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should also consider the order of the columns in the DataFrames during comparison. One approach is to sort the columns based on their names before comparison. This will ensure that identical DataFrames with different column orders are correctly identified as not equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_columns = sorted(self_axes[0])  # Sort columns of self DataFrame
    other_columns = sorted(other_axes[0])  # Sort columns of other DataFrame

    if self_columns != other_columns:  # Check if column orders match
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function includes sorting the columns of each DataFrame before comparison. This will ensure that DataFrames with the same elements but in different column orders are correctly identified as not equal.
