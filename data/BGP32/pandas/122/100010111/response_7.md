### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The function compares the axes of the two BlockManager objects `self` and `other`, stored in `self.axes` and `other.axes`.
2. If the lengths of the axes are not equal, it immediately returns False.
3. It then proceeds to compare each block within the BlockManager objects using the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and `mgr_locs`.

### Explain the cause of the bug
The bug likely arises from not comparing the actual data within the blocks of the DataFrame objects (`self` and `other`). The error message indicates that the equality comparison returns True when it is expected to return False, which suggests that the data within the blocks is not being compared effectively.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of the DataFrame objects includes the actual data within the blocks, not just the axes and block properties.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    # Check if axes are equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    # Check if axes content is equal
    for axis1, axis2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not axis1.equals(axis2):
            return False

    # Check if the actual data blocks are equal
    for idx, block in enumerate(self.blocks):
        if not block.equals(other.blocks[idx]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares the data within the blocks of the two BlockManager objects, ensuring that the equality check includes the actual content of the DataFrames.
