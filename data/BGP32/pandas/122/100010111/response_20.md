### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are equal, then the number of blocks they contain, and finally if all the blocks are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The bug may be caused by the mismatch in the data type of columns between `df1` and `df2`, leading to a false equality comparison.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison accounts for the data type difference.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the comparison logic to consider the columns' data types while checking for equality.
2. Ensure that the function handles cases where the columns contain data of different types appropriately to return the correct result.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.identifier(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function and including the block's identifier along with data type and locations, we can ensure that the function differentiates between blocks with similar data types but different locations. This change should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
