### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function is `equals`, and it is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when the expected output should be `False`. This error is identified in a specific test case related to DataFrame comparison.

### Error Location:
The error might be occurring due to the incorrect comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager`. The function sorts blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs`, which could lead to incorrect comparisons.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The function performs a comparison of `BlockManager` based on the order of blocks sorted by type name and `mgr_locs`.
- In the failing test case, the function improperly sorts the blocks according to their data types, causing the incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks within the `BlockManager` are compared correctly. Instead of sorting blocks based on type name and location, we should compare them based on their actual content, preventing this specific issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the sorting of blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`.
2. Updated the comparison operation to directly compare blocks within the `BlockManager` instead of sorting them based on specific properties.

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` and address the issue reported on GitHub.
