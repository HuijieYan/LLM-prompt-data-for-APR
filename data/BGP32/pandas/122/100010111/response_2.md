### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. The current implementation is failing the test case provided because it returns `True` instead of `False` when the two DataFrames have different values in the columns. The issue is related to how the block order is canonicalized, leading to incorrect results.

### Potential error locations:
1. Canonicalization of block order using `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. Comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` which might lead to the wrong answer.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the current implementation compares block equality based on the canonicalization of block order using `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This approach is not suitable for comparing DataFrames with different values in columns, leading to the incorrect results.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to consider the content of the blocks rather than the order derived from the canonicalization method. By iterating over the blocks and comparing them directly, we can ensure that the equality check considers the actual values within the blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

By directly comparing the blocks in the corrected version, we ensure that the function evaluates equality based on the actual content of the blocks rather than their canonicalized order. This should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected results for the given test case.
