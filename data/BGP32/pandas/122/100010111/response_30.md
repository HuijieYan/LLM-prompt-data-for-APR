### Analysis
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails.
3. The issue on GitHub reports that `equals` wrongly returns `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
4. The bug seems to stem from how the `canonicalize` function is used for sorting the blocks.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of blocks due to the flawed implementation of the `canonicalize` function in sorting the blocks. This leads to the function falsely returning `True` even when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to refine the `canonicalize` function to properly identify and distinguish between identical blocks with different locations. By addressing the sorting issue, we can ensure that the `equals` function correctly detects differences in block locations.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Update canonicalize function to handle block locations correctly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.data.tobytes(), block.dtype.str)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to compare block values and data types instead of just the block type and manager locations, the corrected function can accurately identify differences between blocks with the same content but different locations.
