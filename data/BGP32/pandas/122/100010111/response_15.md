### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two instances of `BlockManager` by their `axes` and `blocks` attributes.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is expecting `df1.equals(df2)` to return `False`, but it is actually returning `True`.
3. The expected input values are DataFrame objects with different data, so the `equals` method should return `False`.
4. The bug seems to arise from the comparison logic within the `canonicalize` function where block order and type are combined.
5. The comparison should treat the data itself and not the internal representation which is being affected by the order.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from the fact that the `canonicalize` function does not account for the actual data order when comparing blocks. It only considers the type of the blocks and their locations, which leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the data is the same but the locations are different.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the actual block values for comparison rather than just the block type and locations. This modification will ensure that the comparison checks the data itself without being affected by the internal representations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.to_numpy().tolist()  # Modify to compare the actual values instead

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to compare the actual block values using `to_numpy()`, the corrected version ensures that the comparison is based on the data content rather than internal representations. This fix will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
