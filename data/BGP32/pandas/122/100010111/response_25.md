### Analysis:
The `equals` method in the `block.py` file compares two BlockManager objects for equality. The error message indicates that the method is returning `True` incorrectly when two DataFrames are not equal. The main issue seems to be how the `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` are being sorted and compared.

The issue reported on GitHub highlights a similar problem where the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` in the scenario of identical blocks with different locations.

### Bug:
The bug lies in how the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are being sorted and compared. This results in the incorrect equality check and leads to the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are correctly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. This involves modifying how the block sorting and comparison is done.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice().start)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on dtype name and start location of mgr_locs. By doing this, we address the issue of incorrectly returning `True` when comparing different blocks with different locations.
