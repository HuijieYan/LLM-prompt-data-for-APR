### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. It compares the axes, consolidates both instances, sorts the blocks based on certain criteria, and then checks if the blocks are equal.
2. The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False`, but it is erroneously returning `True`.
3. The bug likely arises from how the comparison of blocks is handled after consolidating and sorting them.
4. To address the bug, a strategy could involve ensuring that the blocks are correctly consolidated and sorted before comparing them to provide accurate equality checks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by an incorrect comparison of blocks after consolidation and sorting, leading to a false positive result of equality even when the blocks are not equal.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the comparison between blocks after consolidation and sorting should be more robust to accurately determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.get_slice(slice(None)).tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

Applying this corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the comparison of `BlockManager` instances is done accurately.
