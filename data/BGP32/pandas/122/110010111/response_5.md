### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are equal and then checking each block for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the blocks within the `BlockManager` object have different locations but are actually equivalent, leading to a false positive result.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` method to consider the block values instead of just their locations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize` function to consider the content of the block rather than just the locations.
2. Instead of relying solely on the block locations for sorting, compare the block values directly.
3. Modify the comparison logic in the `equals` method to correctly compare the blocks between the two `BlockManager` instances.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Update the canonicalize function to consider block values
def canonicalize(block):
    return (block.get_values(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider block values and modifying the comparison logic in the `equals` method, the corrected version of the function should now produce the expected output and resolve the GitHub issue.
