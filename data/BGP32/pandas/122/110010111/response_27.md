### Identified issues in the buggy function:
1. The `canonicalize` function is missing, which leads to a NameError.
2. The `block` variable is not defined within the `canonicalize` function, causing a NameError.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs due to missing information related to the `canonicalize` function and the undefined `block` variable. This results in a failure to sort and compare blocks correctly within the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `canonicalize` function properly within the `BlockManager` class, including the necessary operations.
2. Ensure that the `block` variable is correctly defined within the `canonicalize` function to avoid any NameError.

### Corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: canonicalize(block))
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version defines the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method and ensures that the `block` variable is properly used within it to resolve the NameError issue.
