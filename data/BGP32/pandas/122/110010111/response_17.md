### Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function
1. Comparing the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
2. Comparing the equality of elements in `self_axes` and `other_axes`.
3. Sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because of a mismatch in the expected behavior of the `equals` method. The function is erroneously returning `True` when it should return `False` due to a misinterpretation in checking the equality of blocks between `self` and `other`.

The error message highlights that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed because it expected `True is False`. The issue arises from the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects using the `equals` method, resulting in a wrong evaluation of their equality.

To resolve this bug, we need to fix the comparison logic for `self` and `other` objects in the `equals` method.

### Suggestions for fixing the bug
We need to update the comparison logic in the `equals` method. Specifically, we should ensure that the comparison between the blocks in `self` and `other` is done correctly. This involves considering the ordering and datatype of the blocks to determine their equality accurately.

### Corrected Version of the function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to consider the block type and values for comparison, we can accurately determine the equality between `self` and `other` objects. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output.
