### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing each block within them.
2. The failing test is trying to assert that calling `equals` on two DataFrame instances should return `False`, but it wrongly returns `True`.
3. The bug could be in the comparison logic within the `equals` function where the blocks are being compared.
4. The bug was raised as a GitHub issue indicating an incorrect return for the `equals` method when comparing DataFrames.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the function arises from how the blocks are sorted and compared. The canonicalization of blocks based on dtype name and manager locations causes the wrong blocks to be compared.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are correctly compared while considering the unconsolidated blocks. One way to achieve this is to update the `canonicalize` function to handle unconsolidated blocks effectively.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, consider unconsolidated blocks
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, getattr(block, 'mgr_locs', None))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now handles unconsolidated blocks by checking if `mgr_locs` attribute is present. This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the blocks are compared correctly.
