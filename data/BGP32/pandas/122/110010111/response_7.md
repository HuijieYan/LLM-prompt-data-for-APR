### Error Analysis:
- The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is supposed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The error message indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` that have different values in the columns.
- The expected behavior is for the function to return `False` in this case.
- The bug occurs because the `equals` function does not correctly handle the case where the values in the block are different but the blocks themselves are equal.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function first compares the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. It then consolidates the blocks of both instances.
3. Next, it sorts the blocks using a `canonicalize` function that combines the dtype name of the block with its manager locations.
4. Finally, it compares each pair of blocks for equality.

The bug arises in the comparison step where it considers the blocks equal even when the values within them are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the block comparison logic to compare the actual values within the blocks rather than just the blocks themselves.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False

        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()

        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        return all(
            pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

By using `pd.testing.assert_frame_equal`, we can compare the actual values inside each block for equality. This correction ensures that the function correctly checks for equality based on the block values, satisfying the expected behavior and addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
