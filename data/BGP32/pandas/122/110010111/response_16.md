### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` to check for equality.
   
2. **Error**: The function is failing to correctly identify that two dataframes are not equal, leading to the test assertion error `assert True is False`.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The bug is likely caused by the comparison logic not properly handling the equality check between two `BlockManager` instances with differing block order.
   - The `equals` method first compares the axes of both instances and then attempts to compare individual blocks. However, if the block order is not consistent, the comparison would fail.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Modify the comparison logic to consider the order of the blocks when checking for equality.
   - Ensure that the comparison includes a step to sort the blocks before comparing them.
  
### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Sort blocks by type name and manager location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), str(block.mgr_locs))
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now properly compare two `BlockManager` instances considering the block order as well, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
