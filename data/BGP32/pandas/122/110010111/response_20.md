### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `equals(self, other)` within the `BlockManager` class. This function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` objects (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals()` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The bug occurs because the equality comparison is not handling the case where identical blocks exist but with different locations. This results in a false evaluation of equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals()` function to account for block order differences that might exist due to unconsolidated blocks.
5. The corrected version of the `equals()` function should compare the blocks considering their content, rather than just the order of the blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Sort the blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances based on a canonical form that incorporates the block's type name and the manager's locations.
2. Then compare the sorted blocks for equality. This will ensure that identical blocks with different locations are still recognized as equal.

### Corrected Version of the `equals()` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals()` method should correctly return `False`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
