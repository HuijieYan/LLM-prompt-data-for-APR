### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**: The `equals` function is part of the `BlockManager` class, which is an internal data structure for implementing DataFrame and Series.
   
2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - Comparison of axes lengths
   - Iteration and comparison of blocks
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug arises due to the comparison logic implemented in the `equals` function. The function checks the lengths of axes, compares them, and then proceeds to sort and compare the blocks. If any of these comparisons fail, the function returns `False`.
   - In this specific case, the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` instead of `False` when trying to compare two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` with different values in the columns. The issue lies in how the DataFrame blocks are being sorted and compared, leading to incorrect outputs.
   - The error message shows that the assertion failed because `True is False`, indicating that the function wrongly returned `True`.
  
4. **Fixing Strategy**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to correct the in-place consolidation step and the comparison of blocks in the `equals` function. The key change required is in how the blocks are sorted and compared.
   - We need to ensure that the axes lengths are correctly compared and subsequent block comparisons are carried out accurately to reflect the actual equality or inequality of the DataFrames.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By introducing the correct sorting with `block.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tostring()`, we can ensure that the blocks are compared correctly when checking for equality between two DataFrames. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test while satisfying the expected input/output values.
