### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing their blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is incorrect, leading to a failed test case.
3. The expected input values for the buggy function are two `BlockManager` instances with the same shape and data but potentially different block locations.
4. The bug likely arises from the comparison of the `BlockManager` blocks without considering the potential variation in block locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to account for different block locations within the `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `equals` function not accounting for the variation in block locations when comparing two `BlockManager` instances. The current comparison method may incorrectly return `True` even if the block locations are different, leading to the failed test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the comparison logic in the `equals` function to compare blocks considering their content and location.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the blocks in the `BlockManager` instances have different locations but contain the same data.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values,)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, the comparison of `BlockManager` instances should correctly handle cases where blocks have different locations but contain the same data. This update should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
