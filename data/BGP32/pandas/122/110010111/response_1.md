### Identification of potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might be causing issues.
2. Sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` using the `canonicalize` function might not correctly handle the block comparison.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is due to the fact that the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not handle the block comparison correctly. This leads to incorrect comparison results and the function returning `True` instead of `False`. The issue lies in the sorting order determined by `canonicalize`, which does not fully consider the content of the blocks.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the sorting mechanism needs to be adjusted in a way that properly handles the comparison of blocks. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block data itself for sorting, ensuring a more accurate comparison between blocks.

### Corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.items)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by sorting the blocks based on their content rather than just their names and locations. This should ensure that the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` is done correctly, fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
