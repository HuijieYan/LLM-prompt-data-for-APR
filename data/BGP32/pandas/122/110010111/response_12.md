### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison fails and returns `True` incorrectly.
3. The expected behavior is that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` should evaluate to `True`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic in the `equals` method, which fails to handle the case where the blocks have the same data but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks does not consider the actual data in the blocks, only their dtype and mgr_locs.
2. When two blocks have the same data but different locations, they are not considered equal by the comparison logic.
3. This results in the `equals` method returning `True` incorrectly since it expects all blocks to be in exactly the same order.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include the actual data values contained in the blocks in addition to dtype and mgr_locs.
2. This change will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal during the comparison process in the `equals` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixed version of the equals method
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        # Include actual block values along with dtype and mgr_locs in the tuple
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` method should now properly handle the comparison of blocks with the same data values but different locations, ensuring that the comparison process reflects the actual equality of the `BlockManager` instances.
