### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between the two `DataFrame` objects `df1` and `df2` fails when calling the `equals` function.
3. The expected input values for the buggy function involve the axes and blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects.
4. The bug seems to be happening when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, which could be due to an incorrect sorting method.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the problem where `DataFrame.equals` returns `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames with identical blocks but different locations.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the incorrect ordering of blocks when comparing two `BlockManager` objects. The sorting method used does not consider the order of blocks correctly, leading to a false comparison result.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects are sorted in a way that considers block type and locations accurately. This will enable a proper comparison between the blocks and return the correct result.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using block info representation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version adds a `canonicalize` function to define the sorting key based on block type and locations. Then, it sorts the blocks of both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects using this function to ensure a proper comparison.
