### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates an assertion failure where `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` but is returning `True`.
3. The buggy function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects and their blocks to determine equality.
4. A possible cause of the bug is the comparison of blocks in the `canonicalize` function which may not handle the comparison correctly.
5. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their dtype name and locations which may not be a reliable way to distinguish blocks.
6. A strategy to fix the bug involves ensuring that the comparison of blocks is done in a more accurate manner.

### Correction:
```python
def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # Check if the blocks are equal
        def blocks_equal(block1, block2):
            return block1.equals(block2)
        
        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False

        return all(blocks_equal(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the `equals` function explicitly compares the `BlockManager` blocks using the `equals` method of each block, ensuring a reliable check for equality.
