### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed. The expected output is `False`, but the actual output is `True`, leading to the assertion error.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the data blocks are being compared within the `equals` function. The function compares the blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations. However, due to incorrect ordering or inconsistencies, the comparison fails, resulting in a wrong output.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered and compared within the `equals` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Order the blocks based on a consistent criterion to ensure that the comparison is accurate.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider the order and content of the blocks for equality.
3. Make sure to consolidate the blocks before performing the comparison to avoid issues with unconsolidated blocks.
4. Refactor the `canonicalize` function to properly handle the blocks and their locations for comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Order blocks based on dtype name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By making the above corrections to the `equals` function, we should address the bug and ensure that the comparison between `BlockManager` instances works correctly, passing the failing test case.
