### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality, based on various attributes like axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to comparing the existing blocks in different orders rather than the actual content.

### Identified bug:
The bug seems to be in the sorting of blocks before comparison. The order of blocks' elements might be different, resulting in returning incorrect results.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by sorting the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function that sorts by `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This approach can lead to different blocks being treated as unequal due to their sorting order.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should sort the blocks based on a more reliable indicator of equality, such as comparing the content directly, rather than relying on sorting criteria that might cause discrepancies.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    # Ensure the blocks have the same order before comparison
    self_blocks = sorted(self_blocks, key=lambda block: block._block._insert_order)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_blocks, key=lambda oblock: oblock._block._insert_order)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we are directly comparing the blocks' content for equality after sorting them based on a more reliable indicator (insert order) rather than relying on a custom sorting function that might lead to discrepancies.
