### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality. 
2. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails with `assert True is False`, indicating that the function incorrectly returns `True` for equal dataframes.
3. The bug seems to be related to comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects based on their types and locations.
4. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem where `equals` incorrectly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
   
### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is identified in the `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks by their type and location. Since the block's location is considered during sorting, blocks with the same data but different locations could mistakenly be considered unequal, causing the incorrect result in the `equals` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism in the `equals` function to only consider the block's type when comparing blocks for equality.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function only considers the block's dtype during sorting, ensuring that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as equal. This version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
