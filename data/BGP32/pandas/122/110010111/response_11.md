### Bug Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
   
2. **Error Location**: The function is not properly comparing the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The function currently sorts the blocks based on their type and locations but then compares them in a one-to-one manner without considering the locations.
   - The error message indicates that the comparison results in `True` when it should be `False`, meaning the function is not correctly identifying the unequal blocks.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Update the comparison logic to consider the actual values within each block rather than just their type and location.
   - Modify the function to loop through the blocks and compare them individually to ensure equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks individually
    for block_name in self.blocks.keys():
        self_block = self.blocks[block_name]
        other_block = other.blocks[block_name]
        
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By comparing each block individually, the corrected function ensures that the content within the blocks is compared correctly. This fix should address the issue raised on GitHub.
