### Identification of potential error locations:
1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` function could be incorrect.
2. The sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` might not be done properly.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. When comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method, it wrongly returns `True` instead of `False` even if the blocks have identical values but are located differently.

In the failing test case, the two DataFrames have identical blocks but are located differently in memory. Due to this difference in block locations, the comparison leads to a false positive, implying that the DataFrames are equal when they are not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of relying on the block locations, compare the contents of the blocks directly.
2. Modify the comparison logic to check if the blocks are equal based on their values, not their memory locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Comparison based on block values
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the values of the blocks instead of their memory locations, this corrected version will provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test case.

This change will ensure that DataFrames with identical values but different block locations are correctly identified as not equal.
