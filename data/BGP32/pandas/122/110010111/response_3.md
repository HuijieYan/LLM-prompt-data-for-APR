### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the `pandas.core.internals.managers` module.
2. The error message indicates that the `df1.equals(df2)` assertion is failing.
3. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. In this case, the comparison fails due to different axis values and block order.
4. The bug causes the function to return `True` instead of `False` when comparing two `BlockManager` instances with identical blocks in a different order.
5. The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to sort the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparing them.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation before comparison, the bug in the `equals` function has been fixed. This correction ensures that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances considers identical blocks with different locations as unequal.
