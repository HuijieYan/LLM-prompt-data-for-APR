### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The issue arises if there are identical blocks in different locations within the two dataframes being compared. Due to the comparison method not accounting for different block locations, the method prematurely returns True instead of False.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function compares the blocks within the two dataframes using a sorting method without considering the blocks' actual locations. This leads to the function returning True in cases where the blocks are the same but located differently. The input dataframes provided in the failing test `df1` and `df2` are structured in a way that will trigger this bug and cause the assert statement to fail.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the comparison of blocks between the two dataframes should be refined to account for the actual block locations. This refinement will prevent the premature True return and accurately compare the dataframes based on their content.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize_and_sort(blocks):
        return sorted(blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    self_blocks = canonicalize_and_sort(self.blocks)
    other_blocks = canonicalize_and_sort(other.blocks)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the sorting mechanism within the `canonicalize_and_sort` function, the corrected `equals` method ensures that blocks are compared accurately even if they are located differently, thus fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
