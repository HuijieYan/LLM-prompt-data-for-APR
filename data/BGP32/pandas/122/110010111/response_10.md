### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` in the `BlockManager` class is used to check equality between two `BlockManager` instances by comparing their attributes like `axes` and `blocks`.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that when comparing two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` function, the actual output is `True` instead of the expected `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly comparing the blocks based on their order. In the provided example, the order of the blocks inside the DataFrames is different but the content is the same, leading to a false outcome.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the way the blocks are compared so that the content is compared properly, regardless of their order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use a different method to compare the blocks inside the `BlockManager` instances.
2. Instead of relying on the order while comparing the blocks, we can compare the blocks based on their content to ensure correct equality checking.
3. Implement a better comparison strategy that considers identical blocks with different orders as equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Corrected version of the equals function
    def equals(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, BlockManager):
            return False
        
        # Check equality of axes
        if self.axes != other.axes:
            return False
        
        # Consolidate blocks before comparison
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        # Compare blocks based on content, not order
        self_blocks = {block.dtype.name: block.values for block in self.blocks}
        other_blocks = {block.dtype.name: block.values for block in other.blocks}
        
        # Check if the blocks are equal
        return self_blocks == other_blocks
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will properly compare the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances to determine equality, instead of relying on the order of the blocks. This approach ensures that identical blocks with different orders are considered equal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
