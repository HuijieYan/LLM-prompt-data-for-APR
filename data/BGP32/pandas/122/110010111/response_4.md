### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function is the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class. This method is used to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The `equals` method checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` objects are the same, then consolidates them in place and proceeds to compare the blocks within the objects.

The provided error message indicates that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method returns `True` when it should have returned `False`. This issue was also reported on GitHub as a bug where the `equals` method wrongly returns `True` when there are identical blocks with different locations.

### Identifying potential error locations

1. The comparison logic inside the `equals` method may not be handling the case of blocks with different locations correctly.
2. The consolidation of blocks in-place might have unexpected side effects.

### Cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the `equals` method is not correctly handling the case where blocks have the same content but different locations. This leads to the comparison returning `True` incorrectly even when the blocks are not equal. The issue arises during the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their types and locations.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects considers both the type of content and the locations of the blocks. Additionally, we need to review the in-place consolidation process to prevent unwanted side effects.

### Corrected version of the `equals` method

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self_copy = self.copy(deep=False)
    other_copy = other.copy(deep=False)

    self_copy._consolidate_inplace()
    other_copy._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self_copy.blocks) != len(other_copy.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.__class__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other_copy.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
1. We create copies of `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances to avoid modifying the original objects during consolidation.
2. We sort the blocks based on both the type of data and the locations to ensure a proper comparison.
3. We compare the sorted blocks to determine equality.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the `equals` method return the expected results, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
