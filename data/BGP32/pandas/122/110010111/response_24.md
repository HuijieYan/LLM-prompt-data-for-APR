### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for comparing two instances of `BlockManager` for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should return `False`.
3. The bug likely occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
4. The issue on GitHub specifies the problem where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in the case of identical blocks with different locations.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Sort the blocks based on their content to ensure proper comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to compare the sorted blocks.
3. Ensure that the axes and blocks are correctly compared for equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is done correctly by sorting the blocks based on content before comparison.
