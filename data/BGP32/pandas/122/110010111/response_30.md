### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` within the `BlockManager` class is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False` for two DataFrame objects that are expected to be not equal.
3. The function compares the attributes `axes` and `blocks` of the two `BlockManager` objects. If any of these attributes differ, the function should return `False`.
4. The comparison involves checking the axes for equality and then sorting and comparing the blocks using a specific order.
5. The error occurs in the final `return all(...)` statement where the blocks are compared, as it seems to be incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely within the comparison and sorting of the blocks in the `equals` function, specifically in the `return all(...)` statement where the blocks are being compared.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks in the `equals` function. The sorting mechanism used to sort the blocks before comparison may not be robust enough to correctly identify when the two `BlockManager` objects are not equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic for the blocks in the `equals` function is correctly identifying differences between the two `BlockManager` objects. This may involve revising the way the blocks are sorted and compared to guarantee an accurate equality check.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version adjusts the `canonicalize` function to include `block.values` in the sorting process for the blocks. This modification should lead to a more accurate comparison of the blocks and ultimately fix the bug.
