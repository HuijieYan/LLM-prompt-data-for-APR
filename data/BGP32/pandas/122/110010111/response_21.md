### Error Analysis:
- The `equals()` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on the equality of their axes and blocks. However, the comparison logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
- The failing test case is checking if `df1.equals(df2)` returns `False` as expected. In this case, `df1` and `df2` are DataFrames with different data types in columns `a` and `b`, so they should not be equal.
- The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` instead of `False`, leading to the assertion failure.
- The bug seems to be related to not considering the actual data content when determining equality.

### Bug Cause:
- The `equals()` function wrongly assumes that the equality of axes and blocks is sufficient to determine equality between `BlockManager` instances. However, the comparison should also consider the actual data stored within the blocks.
- Since the equality comparison is done directly on the blocks without considering their content, the function mistakenly concludes that the blocks are equal even when their data differs.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `equals()` function to compare the actual data content within the blocks in addition to comparing axes and block structures.
- Update the comparison logic to iterate through the blocks and check the equality of their contents instead of directly comparing the block instances.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        (block.values == oblock.values).all() for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By incorporating the data content comparison in the `equals()` function, the corrected version should address the bug and correctly determine the equality of two `BlockManager` instances based on their actual data values.
