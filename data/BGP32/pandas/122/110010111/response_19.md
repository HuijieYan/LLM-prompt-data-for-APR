### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class, specifically in the comparison of blocks and their ordering.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is happening because when comparing the blocks between two `BlockManager` instances, the ordering of the blocks is not consistent. This inconsistency leads to the `equals` method returning `True` erroneously.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently before comparing them. This can be achieved by creating a canonical representation of the blocks based on their type name and locations, and then sorting them before comparing.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version sorts the blocks within `BlockManager` instances based on their type names and locations before comparing them.
