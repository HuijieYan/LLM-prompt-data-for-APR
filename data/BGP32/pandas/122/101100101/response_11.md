To fix the buggy function, we need to address the issue with the comparison of blocks between two BlockManager instances. The bug occurs due to the comparison of blocks not being done correctly. To resolve this, we need to compare the block values directly instead of just using `equals` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: tuple(x.values()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: tuple(x.values()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By directly comparing the block values in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, we ensure that the correct comparison is made between blocks for equality.

This corrected version should now correctly compare the blocks of two BlockManager instances and pass the failing test provided.
