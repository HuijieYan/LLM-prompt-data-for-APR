The bug in the provided function `equals()` is due to the use of the `canonicalize()` function which returns a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` to compare blocks for equality. The issue arises because `block.dtype.name` is not sufficient to uniquely identify and compare blocks. Additionally, the `mgr_locs` attribute is accessed incorrectly causing a failure.

To fix the bug, we should update the `canonicalize()` function to include more information for block comparison. We can modify it to return a tuple of block's data type, data shape, and data values. This will ensure a comprehensive check for block equality.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals()` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or any(ax1 != ax2 for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on data type, shape, and values
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.values.shape, block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will correctly compare the blocks based on their data type, shape, and values, ensuring a proper check for block equality.

This updated version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
