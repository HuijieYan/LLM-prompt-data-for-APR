The bug in the provided function arises from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The sorting mechanism applied to both blocks does not consider the underlying data and instead only relies on the block's type and manager locations. In cases where the block types are the same but the underlying data is different, the function erroneously returns True.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the actual block data within each block as well. We can achieve this by enhancing the `canonicalize` function to include the block data along with the type and manager locations. This way, we ensure that blocks are compared based on both their metadata and underlying data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that comparisons between blocks take into account both their metadata and data contents, thus fixing the bug.

With this correction, the function should now pass the provided failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal`.
