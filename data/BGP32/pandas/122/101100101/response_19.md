The bug in the provided `equals` function stems from how the `canonicalize` function is sorting the blocks based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The `mgr_locs` attribute is not accessible directly from the block object. 

To fix this bug:
1. We can modify the `canonicalize` function to include block type and shape information for comparison purposes.
2. Modify the sorting logic to sort the blocks based on the revised `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.shape, block.get_values())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function includes a modified `canonicalize` function that considers the block type, shape, and values for comparison. The blocks are then sorted based on this information before performing the comparison.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
