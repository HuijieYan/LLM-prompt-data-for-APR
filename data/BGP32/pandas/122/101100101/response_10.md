The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the way blocks are being compared and sorted. The bug occurs due to incorrect canonicalization of blocks based on their data type name and memory location. This leads to unequal blocks being considered as equal, causing the function to incorrectly return True when the blocks are not actually equal.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the data values of the blocks for comparison. By including the data values in the canonicalization process, we can ensure that blocks with different data values are not incorrectly identified as equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values.tolist())  # Include data values for comparison

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the data values of the blocks in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with different data values are correctly identified as unequal. This corrected version of the `equals` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
