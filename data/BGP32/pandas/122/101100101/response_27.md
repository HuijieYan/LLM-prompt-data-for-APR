## Analysis
The buggy function in the provided code is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. This method is meant to check the equality of two instances of `BlockManager` by comparing their axes and blocks.

The bug in the current implementation lies in the `canonicalize` function used to sort the blocks before comparison. The issue is that `mgr_locs` is accessed incorrectly in the `canonicalize` function. The correct way to access `mgr_locs` is by calling the `get_locs` method on the block instance, not by directly accessing it as an attribute.

## Bug Explanation
In the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method, the incorrect attribute access of `mgr_locs` using `as_array` is causing the bug. This attribute access should be replaced with `get_locs().to_array`. The incorrect access is leading to a `AttributeError` because the `mgr_locs` attribute does not exist directly on the `block` instance, which is evident in the failing test where the function is trying to call `tolist()` on a non-existent attribute.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, update the `canonicalize` function to correctly retrieve the locations of the block by calling `get_locs().to_array()` on each block instance.

## Updated Corrected Version
```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Existing methods
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.get_locs().to_array().tolist())
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

After applying this fix, the `equals` method should now correctly compare two instances of `BlockManager` and pass the failing test provided.
