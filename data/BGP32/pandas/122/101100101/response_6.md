### Analysis:
- The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking their axes, consolidating them, and then comparing their blocks. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks.
- The bug is likely due to inconsistency in sorting or comparing blocks.
- The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` fails because it expects two DataFrames with columns `a` and `b` but in reversed order.

### Bug:
The bug is likely in the sorting mechanism of blocks inside the `equals` function. Due to this sorting, the comparison between two `BlockManager` instances is incorrect.

### Fix:
We need to ensure that the blocks are sorted correctly before comparing them. One way to fix this is to sort the blocks based on a combination of their data type name and manager locations, ensuring a consistent sorting order.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
    
        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
        # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
        # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
        # the iteration order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(block.dtype), str(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

Now, the corrected version of the `equals` function should handle the block sorting correctly, satisfying the failing test case and expected input/output values.
