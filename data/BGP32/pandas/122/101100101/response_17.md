## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the use of the `self._consolidate_inplace()` and `other._consolidate_inplace()` calls. These calls modify the internal state of the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects, which can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing the blocks later in the function. 

Additionally, the sorting of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function can yield incorrect results if the same block appears in different positions due to unconsolidated blocks that have not been properly distinguished.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should avoid modifying the internal state of the `BlockManager` objects during the comparison process. We should also improve the block sorting mechanism to ensure consistency in the comparison.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    # Other methods from the class...
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self_blocks = tuple(self.blocks)
        other_blocks = tuple(other.blocks)
        
        if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.tolist())
        
        self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other_blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted)
        )
```

With this correction, we ensure that the internal state of the `BlockManager` objects is not modified during the comparison, and we address the sorting issue to provide a consistent comparison mechanism.
