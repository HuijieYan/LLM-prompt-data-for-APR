## Analysis
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects for equality. The function first checks if the axes of the two objects are equal in length and content. Then, it consolidates the blocks within each `BlockManager` object. After consolidation, the function compares the blocks of the two objects by sorting them based on the type name and location of the blocks.

The bug occurs when comparing the blocks because the comparison logic is incorrect. The comparison should not rely on the order of blocks but rather on the content of the blocks themselves.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the use of `sorted` to order the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a comparison function `canonicalize`. This function orders the blocks based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. This ordering is problematic because two blocks may be semantically equal even if they have different `mgr_locs`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should directly compare the blocks in a pairwise manner rather than sorting them. We should iterate over the blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects and check for equality between corresponding blocks.

## Corrected Version
```python
def equals_fixed(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block1.equals(block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

Now, the `equals_fixed` function directly compares the blocks without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This new implementation should pass the failing test case.
