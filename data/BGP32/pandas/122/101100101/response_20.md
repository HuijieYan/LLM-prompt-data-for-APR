The bug in the given function arises from the improper comparison of the self.blocks and other.blocks variables. The function is attempting to compare these tuple values directly, which leads to incorrect results. Instead, we need to compare the individual blocks within the tuples.

To fix this bug, we need to iterate through the blocks in each tuple individually and compare them.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/internals/managers.py

class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block order
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        
        # Compare each block individually
        for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not self_block.equals(other_block):
                return False
        
        return True
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided and satisfy all the expected input/output variable values.
