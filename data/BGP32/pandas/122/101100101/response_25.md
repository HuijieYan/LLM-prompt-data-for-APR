The bug in the provided function is likely due to the way it sorts and compares the blocks in the BlockManager. The function sorts the blocks based on a canonicalization function, but it seems that the compare logic might be flawed. The function should compare the blocks directly for equality instead of comparing the sorted blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version directly compares the blocks within the BlockManager for equality without sorting them. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case provided.
