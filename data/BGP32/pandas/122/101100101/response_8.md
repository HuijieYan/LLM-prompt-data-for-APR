The bug in the provided function `equals` is that it fails to compare the blocks correctly due to non-matching block order and inconsistent data types. When comparing the blocks, it should consider both the data type name and the block locations. The `canonicalize` function aims to standardize the comparison by creating a tuple of data type name and block locations for sorting.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently based on the data type name and block locations before comparing them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array().tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort both `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` before comparing them in the final step. This ensures that the block comparison considers both the data type name and block locations, fixing the inconsistency issue.
