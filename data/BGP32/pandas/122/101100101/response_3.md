The bug in the provided `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function is intended to create a unique identifier for each block based on its dtype name and manager locations. However, the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block is being accessed incorrectly as a method with `as_array` and `tolist()` calls. This causes a `'Block' object has no attribute 'as_array'` error.

To fix the bug, the `canonicalize` function should correctly access the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block object without calling non-existent methods. Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the dtype name and manager locations
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version of the function accesses the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks directly without any method calls. This modification should fix the bug and allow the function to run without errors. The function should now pass the failing test case provided.
