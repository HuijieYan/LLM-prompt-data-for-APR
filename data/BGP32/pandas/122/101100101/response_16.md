The bug in the provided `equals` function is that it does not correctly compare the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. The function incorrectly sorts the blocks before comparing them, which can lead to a false negative comparison result.

To fix this bug, we should compare the blocks directly without sorting them. Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # other functions remain the same

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks)
        )
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with its corresponding block in `other.blocks`. This approach ensures that the blocks are compared correctly without sorting them, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
