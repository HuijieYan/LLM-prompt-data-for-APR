The bug in the `equals` method stems from how the `canonicalize` function is being used to sort the blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The bug causes the comparison of the blocks to fail even if the content of the blocks is the same, due to how the blocks are sorted based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
- Instead of sorting the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we can directly compare the blocks in the same order they appear in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version directly compares each block in `self.blocks` with the corresponding block in `other.blocks` without sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This way, it ensures that the comparison is based on block content rather than arbitrary sorting criteria.
