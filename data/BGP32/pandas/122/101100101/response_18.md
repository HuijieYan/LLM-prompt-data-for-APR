The bug in the `equals` function lies in the way it compares the blocks in `self` and `other` BlockManagers. The bug causes the function to incorrectly determine the equality of DataFrames.

The bug stems from the sorting of the blocks using the `canonicalize` function. The sorting is based on the `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` of the blocks. However, the comparison is performed by the `equals` method of each block. Since the blocks are sorted differently than how they are compared, the function may return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting criteria match the equality comparison. Instead of sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`, we can directly compare the blocks before sorting them.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the individual blocks of `self` and `other` BlockManagers and return the expected results for the failing test case provided.
