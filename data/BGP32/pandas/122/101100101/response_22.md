The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the canonicalization and sorting of blocks before comparison. The function `canonicalize(block)` is used to create a tuple of block type and locations for comparison, but it seems to be missing a critical step in the tuple creation.

The issue lies in the line:
```python
return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
```

This line should also include the block's values for proper comparison. Adding `block.values.tolist()` to the tuple creation will ensure that the block values are considered during the comparison process.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name, values, and then mgr_locs for proper comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.tolist(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes the block values in the tuple used for comparison, ensuring that the comparison process is comprehensive. With this fix, the provided test case should pass successfully.
