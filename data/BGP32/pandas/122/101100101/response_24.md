The identified bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly comparing the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The issue arises from the way the `canonicalize` function is defined to sort the blocks in the BlockManager objects for comparison. The comparison logic needs to be adjusted to correctly compare the blocks based on their data and positions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly extract the necessary information for comparison. We can update the `canonicalize` function to consider the data and positions of the blocks when sorting them for comparison. 

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the equals function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function will properly compare the blocks within the BlockManager objects based on their values and positions. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test case provided.

Please replace the buggy function with the corrected version in the `managers.py` file and run the failing test case to verify the fix.
