### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` in the `BlockManager` class compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality. It checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on a canonical representation, and finally compares each block for equality using their `equals` method.

The failing test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` creates two DataFrames with different column data types and checks if they are equal, expecting `False`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the fact that the buggy function does not handle DataFrames with different column data types correctly. When comparing data blocks of different data types (e.g., int64 and object), the comparison incorrectly considers them different, leading to a false inequality result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include the data type information for each block. This modification will ensure that blocks of different data types are treated separately during the comparison, preventing false inequalities.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected code includes the data type along with the block's type and mgr_locs in the `canonicalize` function. This modification ensures that blocks with different data types are treated as distinct entities during the comparison.
