### Bug Explanation
The bug in the provided function arises due to an issue with comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The function attempts to sort the blocks of each `BlockManager` by their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute, but there is an error in the code that leads to incorrect comparison results. This results in the function incorrectly returning `True` when it should actually return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects is done correctly. This can be achieved by properly comparing the blocks based on their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute. Additionally, we need to align the logic of the block order comparison to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After fixing the bug in the `equals` function, it should now correctly compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects based on their type name and `mgr_locs` attribute. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
