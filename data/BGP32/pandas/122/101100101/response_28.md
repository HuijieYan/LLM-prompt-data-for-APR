## Analysis
The buggy function is supposed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. It checks if the axes are the same, then consolidates the blocks within each BlockManager, sorts them, and finally compares them for equality.

The bug is likely due to not considering the order of the blocks when comparing them. The function sorts the blocks in both BlockManagers based on a canonicalization function, but then directly compares each corresponding pair of blocks. This can lead to a false negative if the blocks are not sorted the same way in both BlockManagers.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when comparing the blocks in the BlockManagers. The function sorts the blocks with a canonicalize function, but then directly compares them without taking their order into account. This can lead to a false negative even if the blocks are the same but have different orders.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we compare the blocks in a consistent order after sorting them. We can modify the comparison logic to iterate over the sorted blocks and compare them one by one in order.

## Corrected Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the comparisons are made on the sorted blocks, ensuring that the order of the blocks does not affect the equality check.
