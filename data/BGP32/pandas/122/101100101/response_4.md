### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function fails to correctly compare the blocks due to a lack of canonicalization based on block type and locations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared in a canonicalized manner based on their type and locations. This involves sorting the blocks before comparing them to guarantee a consistent and accurate evaluation.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected version introduces `canonicalize` function to sort the blocks before comparing them. This ensures a consistent and accurate comparison, resolving the bug in the original function.
