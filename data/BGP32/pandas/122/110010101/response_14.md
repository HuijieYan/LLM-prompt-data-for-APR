### Analysis
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is designed to check for equality between two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks. 
2. The function compares the axes of the two instances, then consolidates them in place, sorts the blocks based on their types and locations, and finally compares each block from both instances.
3. The error message indicates that for a specific test case, `df1.equals(df2)` is evaluating to `True` when it should be `False`.
4. The cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect comparison order or the sorting of blocks.
   
### Bug Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between the two `BlockManager` instances is conducted correctly. This involves checking the axes equality first, then consolidating and comparing the blocks in the correct order to guarantee the validity of the equality check.

With this corrected version, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the axes and blocks of the two `BlockManager` instances for equality. This should resolve the issue in the failing test case.
