### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is implemented within the `BlockManager` class.
2. The function compares two `BlockManager` instances for equality.
3. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method resulted in an unexpected `True` value.
4. The function sorts the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances for comparison. The bug likely stems from the sorting mechanism or the comparison logic inside the `equals` function.
   
### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `equals` function tries to compare two `BlockManager` instances based on the sorted blocks. The comparison logic may not correctly handle the content of the blocks, leading to an incorrect equality determination.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly compared for equality. This may involve checking the actual values stored in the blocks within each `BlockManager` instance to determine if they are equal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.get_values())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_values, other_values) for (_, block_values), (_, other_values) in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the actual values in each block by calling `block.get_values()`. This ensures that the equality comparison is based on the content of the blocks rather than their properties.
