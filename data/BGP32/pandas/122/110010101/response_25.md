### Analysis
The buggy function is `equals` inside the `BlockManager` class. The function aims to compare two instances of `BlockManager` based on their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the equality comparison failed when comparing two DataFrames.

### Identified Issue
The issue lies in how the comparison is being made in the `equals` function. The comparison of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` based on their `dtype` is not sufficient to identify equality between `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the current implementation of `canonicalize` function is only considering the `dtype` of blocks to compare equality. However, this is not a robust way to determine equality between `BlockManager` instances as there can be cases where different blocks with the same dtype need to be considered separately.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to implement a more comprehensive equality check for `BlockManager` instances. This can involve comparing the content of each block within the `BlockManager` and ensuring that corresponding blocks are equal.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: str(x))
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with sorting blocks directly inside the `equals` function using `str(x)`. This ensures a more precise comparison between the blocks and will help in identifying the equality between different `BlockManager` instances.
