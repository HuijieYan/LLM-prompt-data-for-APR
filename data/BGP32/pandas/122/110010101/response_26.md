### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals()` compares two BlockManager objects for equality by checking if their axes and blocks are equal.
2. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True`, causing the assertion failure.
3. The expected behavior is for the comparison to return `False` when the axes or blocks are not equal.
4. The bug is likely due to the sorting mechanism based on `canonicalize()` not handling the case where blocks have different types (e.g., int vs. object).
5. We need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to handle different block types when sorting.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `canonicalize()` function to consider both the dtype name and the block type to properly distinguish different block types.
2. Ensure that the sorting mechanism considers the block type along with the dtype name when comparing blocks.
3. This modification should address the bug and make the comparison more robust.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order by including dtype name and block type
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By incorporating the block type into the sorting criteria, the corrected version of the function should now handle different block types properly and pass the failing test.
