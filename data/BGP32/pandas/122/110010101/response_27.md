### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function within the `BlockManager` class is responsible for checking if two `BlockManager` instances are equal. It compares their axes and blocks for equality.
2. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` incorrectly when it should be returning `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of the blocks. The function attempts to sort the blocks in a canonical order but fails to properly compare them for equality.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly compared for equality without sorting them. We can iterate over each block and directly compare them with the corresponding block in the other `BlockManager`.
5. The corrected `equals` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for self_block, other_block in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False
    
    return True
```

By directly comparing each block within the `BlockManager`, we ensure that the function correctly checks for equality without sorting the blocks. This corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
