### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` instances by checking if they have the same axes and blocks. It seems to be comparing based on internal representations of the blocks.
   
2. The error is likely due to how the function compares and sorts the blocks. It's trying to canonicalize blocks for comparison but might be encountering an issue with mixed types in columns.
   
3. The error message states that the assertion of `df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, meaning the function is returning `True` when it should be `False`. This suggests that the equality check is not correctly handling the mixed-type columns in the input DataFrames `df1` and `df2`.
   
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the mixed-type columns appropriately during comparison. We should consider each block's data type and content more carefully in the sorting process.
   
### Correction:
```python
# Fixing the buggy function
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.values.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we modified the `canonicalize` function to include the block's dtype as a string and its values converted to bytes for comparison. This change should help in properly handling the mixed-type columns in the comparison process.
