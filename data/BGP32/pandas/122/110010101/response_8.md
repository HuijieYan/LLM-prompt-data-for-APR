### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is within the `BlockManager` class, which manages labeled 2D mixed-type ndarrays for DataFrame and Series manipulation.
2. The function compares the internal structure of two `BlockManager` objects (`self` and `other`) to determine if they are equal.
3. The failing test indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using `df1.equals(df2)` resulted in an incorrect output.
4. The failure is due to the comparison logic within the `equals` function, which sorts blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, leading to a mismatch with the expected behavior of comparing DataFrames.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is comparing the internal representation of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, which is not intended for DataFrame comparison. This results in `df1.equals(df2)` returning `True is False`, leading to test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `equals` function to compare the data directly instead of sorting blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs.
2. Implement a comparison of the values within the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects to determine equality.
3. Modify the comparison logic to compare the content of DataFrames appropriately.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self_data = self.get_bool_data()  # Retrieve bool data for comparison
    other_data = other.get_bool_data() 
    
    return self_data.equals(other_data)
```

In the corrected version of the `equals` function, the approach has been simplified to compare the actual data values of the two `BlockManager` objects directly. This addresses the issue of incorrectly comparing blocks based on dtype and mgr_locs.
