### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals` is comparing two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
3. The expected input values for the failing test are two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` with different data types in the columns.
4. The bug is likely caused by not handling the case where the data types of corresponding columns are different between `self` and `other`.
5. We need to modify the comparison logic to account for different data types in corresponding columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the comparison logic to include checking for the equality of `object` columns between `self` and `other`.
2. Implement a check for the data type of each column during comparison to ensure correct behavior.
3. Modify the canonicalization function to handle different data types in the blocks.
4. Ensure that the comparison considers different data types without throwing errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, including dtype in the key
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

Now, the corrected function should handle the case where columns have different data types and compare the `BlockManager` instances correctly.
