### Analysis
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is used to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison between two dataframes (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` function is returning `True` unexpectedly.

### Potential Error Location
1. Comparison of axis lengths.
2. Comparison of axes using `equals` method.
3. Sorting and comparing blocks.

### Bug Explanation
The bug seems to be caused by the mismatch in the order of values in the `df1` and `df2` dataframes. The error message shows that the comparison between `df1` and `df2` failed, resulting in an unexpected `True` return.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the axes of both `BlockManager` instances are the same.
2. Check the ordering of the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
3. Adjust the comparison logic during the block comparison step.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
        if not ax1.equals(ax2):
            return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the axes to compare them one by one. Instead of converting `mgr_locs` to a list, we use `as_slice()` to ensure consistent comparisons. Finally, we sort the blocks based on a canonicalize function before comparing them pairwise.
