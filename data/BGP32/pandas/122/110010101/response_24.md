### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects. It checks whether the axes and blocks of the two objects match. The function uses the `equals` method of each block to compare the blocks.
   
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames fails. This failure suggests that the `equals` method of the BlockManager is not functioning correctly.

3. The bug is likely related to how the function compares the individual blocks. If the data types or contents of the blocks are not aligned properly, the comparison will fail. This issue may arise due to blocks being sorted in a way that doesn't match between the two BlockManager objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug fix should focus on ensuring that the blocks are sorted and compared in a consistent manner between the two BlockManager objects.
2. By verifying the sorting order and the structure of each block, we can align the blocks before comparison and resolve the inconsistency causing the failure.
 
### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # For consistent sorting and comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.shape, block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, we ensure that the blocks are sorted consistently based on their shape and values before comparing, which should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
