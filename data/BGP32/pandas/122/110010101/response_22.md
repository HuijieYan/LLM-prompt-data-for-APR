### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is meant to compare two instances of `BlockManager` for equality based on their axes and blocks.
2. The error message is indicating that during the test, the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` is failing, showing that `True` is being returned when it should be `False`.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison logic in the `equals` function. It should compare axes and blocks between two `BlockManager` instances.
4. The cause of the bug is likely due to the comparison of the blocks not being done correctly, possibly due to improper sorting or comparison logic.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of both axes and blocks is done correctly. We can sort the blocks based on a canonical ordering before comparing them. 

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_slice())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on the block's dtype and mgr_locs, allowing for a consistent comparison. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct comparison is made between two `BlockManager` instances.
