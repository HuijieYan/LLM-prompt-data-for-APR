### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking their axes and blocks.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed.
3. The expected input parameters include two `BlockManager` objects with specific axes and blocks, highlighting the order of blocks.
4. The bug seems to be related to block order comparison, where `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` types might not align correctly causing the failure.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that blocks are sorted and compared correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the unsorted order of blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables which leads to incorrect comparisons and subsequent failures.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted before comparison based on a tuple combining the type name and the block's locations.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
