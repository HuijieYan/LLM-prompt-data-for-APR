### Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is used to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class to check if they are equal. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances fails, suggesting an issue with the equality comparison logic in the `equals` function.

The function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` instances and all the blocks within them. However, the bug seems to be related to the way blocks are being sorted and compared because the expected and actual dataframes are different, leading to a failed test.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the fact that the function incorrectly sorts the blocks in both `self` and `other` using a key that combines the dtype name and the mgr_locs. This sorting is problematic because it might not be the most suitable way to differentiate between blocks, especially when comparing two different dataframes.

In the failing test, the two dataframes have different data types in their columns, causing the sorted blocks based on dtype name to lead to false inequality when comparing the blocks.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should rethink the logic of how blocks are sorted before comparison. Instead of using dtype name as the primary criterion, we can consider comparing the block data directly to ensure that the data within the blocks match, irrespective of the dtype name. This change in sorting logic should account for the difference in data types in the columns of the dataframes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

In the corrected version, we removed the sorting of blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs before comparison. This change allows for a direct comparison of the blocks' data within the `BlockManager` instances. This approach should solve the bug and ensure that the equality comparison works correctly for dataframes with different column data types.
