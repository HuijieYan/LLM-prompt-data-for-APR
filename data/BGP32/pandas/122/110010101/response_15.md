### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class. The function is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking their axes and blocks. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`, leading to the test failure.

#### Error Location
1. Comparing the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances.
2. Sorting the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance based on a canonical key for comparison.

#### Bug Cause
1. The bug is likely caused by incorrect sorting of the blocks since the comparison starts returning the incorrect result.
2. It seems that the comparison is not handling the case where the values of the blocks are different.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the comparison between axes of two `BlockManager` instances is accurate.
2. Implement a robust method to compare the blocks considering the data in each block.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.get_values().__str__(), block.dtype.__str__())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.get_values().equals(oblock.get_values()) and block.dtype == oblock.dtype
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that both axes and blocks are properly compared for equality. The blocks' values and data types are considered for equality comparison.
