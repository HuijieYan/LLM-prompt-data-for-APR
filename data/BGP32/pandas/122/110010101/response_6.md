### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is likely caused by incorrect comparison and sorting of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The function is sorting the blocks based on a custom `canonicalize` function that is not comparing the actual block values, leading to incorrect comparisons between two `BlockManager` instances.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the block values directly instead of just sorting based on their types and locations. We should iterate over the blocks in both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances and compare their values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
        
    return True
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function correctly compares the blocks in the two `BlockManager` instances and returns `True` only if all the blocks are equal.
