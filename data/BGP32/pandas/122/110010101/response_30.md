### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes and blocks. The error message suggests that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) failed, indicating there is a bug in the implementation of the `equals` function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug occurs when comparing the axes of two `BlockManager` instances. The implementation compares the axes based on the `equals` method. In this case, although the axes contain the same labels ('a', 'b'), the order of the labels differs between `self` and `other` instances.
   
2. The comparison of blocks is also problematic. The function relies on a sorting mechanism to canonicalize the blocks based on their type name and locations. If the blocks are not consolidated before the comparison, there might be inconsistencies in the block order due to unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the axes comparison considers the order of labels. Additionally, before comparing blocks, we should consolidate the blocks to ensure a consistent block order.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order after consolidation
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_slice(), block.mgr_locs.is_consolidated)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By ensuring the axes comparison accounts for the order of labels and consolidating the blocks before comparison, this corrected version of the `equals` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
