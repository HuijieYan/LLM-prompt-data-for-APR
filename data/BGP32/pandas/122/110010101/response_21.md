### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two instances of the `BlockManager` class for equality. It first checks if the axes of the two instances are equal, then it consolidates the blocks within both instances and compares each block for equality based on data type and locations.
   
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two `DataFrame` instances (`df1` and `df2`) fails, which is caused by an incorrect implementation in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class.

3. The bug causing the failure is likely due to the improper comparison of block elements within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. Specifically, the blocks in the `self` instance and the `other` instance are being consolidated and sorted based on a canonicalization function, but the actual comparison of the blocks is not correctly implemented.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison between blocks in `self` and `other` instances is done correctly. This involves comparing each block in a sorted manner based on data type and locations.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.dtype.name, x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks in both instances are sorted based on data type and locations before performing the comparison. This should resolve the bug and make the `equals` function work correctly.

Now, the corrected function should pass the failing test case provided.
