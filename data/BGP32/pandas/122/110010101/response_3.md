### Bug Analysis
- The `equals()` function is comparing two BlockManager objects based on their axes and blocks. The expected behavior is to check if the axes and blocks of both BlockManager objects are equal.
- The function first compares the lengths of the axes of both objects. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
- Then, it attempts to compare the axes of both objects element-wise using a generator expression with `all()`. If any pair of axes are not equal, it returns `False`.
- After that, it consolidates both BlockManager objects in-place. 
- Next, it compares the lengths of the blocks of both objects. If they are not equal, it returns `False`.
- Finally, it sorts the blocks of both objects based on a canonical order, considering the type name and the manager locations of the blocks. Then it checks if all the blocks are equal using another generator expression with `all()`.

### Bug Explanation
- The failing test is asserting that `df1.equals(df2) is False`, but the assertion fails because the buggy function implementation returns `True` instead of `False`.
- The issue lies in the `canonicalize()` function used to sort the blocks. The way it is sorting the blocks and the subsequent comparison using `all()` is not correct.
- The buggy function fails because it incorrectly compares the blocks of the two BlockManagers after a flawed sorting based on the `canonicalize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Instead of sorting the blocks indiscriminately using a custom canonicalization technique, we should restructure the logic of comparing the blocks directly without relying on sorting.
- We can iterate over the blocks of each BlockManager and compare them one by one without the need for sorting.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

With this corrected version, the function directly compares the blocks of both BlockManagers without sorting, ensuring a correct comparison check.
