### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function Description**: The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality by checking if their axes, blocks, and block types match.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug seems to be in the comparison logic inside the `equals` function where it checks if all blocks are equal. Since the dtype of one block is 'int64' and the other is 'object', the equality check fails incorrectly.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The `canonicalize` function used to sort blocks by type and manager locations generates a tuple of `(dtype name, mgr_locs)` as criteria for sorting.
   - When comparing blocks, the function only considers the block type name and not the specific dtype within the block.
   - Due to this, blocks of different datatypes but with the same type name (e.g., 'object') are wrongly considered equal.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Update the `canonicalize` function to take both dtype name and dtype into account for sorting the blocks.
   - Include the dtype in the tuple criteria for sorting, ensuring blocks with different dtypes are not wrongly considered equal.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on both dtype name and manager locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block.values` (data within the block) in the criteria for sorting, the corrected version should properly handle cases where blocks have the same dtype names but different actual dtypes. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
