### Identified bug:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to the comparison being made between the two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, where the column `a` in `df1` is integers, while the column `a` in `df2` is strings. This causes the equality check to fail, resulting in the assertion error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly compare the values within the DataFrames. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we need to compare the values within the blocks.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]
    
    return all((self_data[i] == other_data[i]).all() for i in range(len(self_data)))
```

This corrected version of the function compares the values within the blocks instead of directly comparing the blocks themselves.
