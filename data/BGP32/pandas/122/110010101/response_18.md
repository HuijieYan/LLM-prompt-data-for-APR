### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class arises from how the function compares the blocks of two `BlockManager` instances. When sorting the blocks, it uses a `canonicalize` function that relies on `block.dtype.name` to sort the blocks. However, in the provided failing test case, the function is called on DataFrame objects that have different column types. This results in comparing blocks of different types, leading to the equality check failing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the type of the column as well. By including the column type along with the block type, we can ensure that the blocks are compared correctly, taking into account the data type as well.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._block_type)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the `equals` function will sort the blocks based on both the data type name and the block type, ensuring that blocks of the same type are compared. This modification should address the bug and allow the function to correctly compare `BlockManager` instances.
