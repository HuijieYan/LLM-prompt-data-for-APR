### Error Analysis
The buggy function `equals()` is used to compare two `BlockManager` instances for equality. The function first compares the axes of the two instances and then compares the blocks. The error message shows that the comparison failed even though the two `DataFrame` instances `df1` and `df2` are different.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks before comparison. The bug causes the function to use the wrong sorting criteria, leading to incorrect comparison results. The error message shows that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`, indicating a failed test for unequal `DataFrame` instances.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to use the correct sorting criteria. The sorting should be based on the block's data rather than the dtype name. By changing the `canonicalize` function to sort based on the block's values, the comparison will be accurate and should return the correct result.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on values rather than dtype name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By sorting the blocks based on values instead of dtype name, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
