### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two BlockManagers for equality. It first checks if the dimensions of the two block managers are equal by comparing the number of axes. Then, it iterates over each axis to check if they are equal. Finally, it compares the blocks within each manager to see if they are equal.

The error occurs because the function uses the `equals` method on the axes, blocks, and individual blocks themselves. This method is used for comparing the values within the objects, not the objects themselves. In the failing test case, the data in `df1` and `df2` are different, and the expected behavior is for the comparison to return `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic to appropriately compare the axes and blocks of the BlockManager objects. We need to introduce a custom comparison function for axes and blocks that considers the structure of the objects, rather than the values.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly compares the block manager's axes and blocks, focusing on the structure of the objects rather than the values within them. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test.
