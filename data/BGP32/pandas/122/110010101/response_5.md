### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if their axes have the same length and if each axis is equal, then proceeds to check if the blocks within the managers are equal based on a custom sorting mechanism.
2. The error message indicates that `df1.equals(df2)` is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to comparing the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances. The issue might be due to comparing the blocks in an incorrect order or dealing with different data types in the blocks.
4. One potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the sorting and comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances are done consistently. Additionally, handling different data types within the blocks should be considered.
5. To correct the bug, the comparison of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances should be revised. Proper sorting based on type and location within the block should be maintained while comparing the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
       
    for i, (self_ax, other_ax) in enumerate(zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        if not self_ax.equals(other_ax):
            return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Custom sorting mechanism for blocks
    def sort_key(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=sort_key)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=sort_key)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

This corrected version ensures that axes are compared properly and that the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances are sorted and compared based on a consistent mechanism.
