### Error Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. The function compares the axis labels and the blocks within the `BlockManager`.
2. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, which means the function returned `True` instead of `False` for an unequal comparison.
3. The cause of the bug is likely related to the comparison between the blocks. The function sorts the blocks based on the dtype name and then compares them. In this case, the sorting and comparison logic for blocks may not be handling the comparison of different data types correctly.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic for blocks handles different data types correctly. We can modify the sorting and comparison process to account for varying data types within blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By converting the `dtype` to a string and comparing it during sorting, we ensure that blocks with different data types are compared correctly. This modification should fix the bug and make the function return the expected values.
