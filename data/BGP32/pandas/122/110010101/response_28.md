### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects to check if they are equal. It first compares the axes of both objects and then compares the blocks. The bug appears to be in the block comparison part.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to how block equality is determined by sorting the blocks based on their dtype names and `mgr_locs`.

3. The error message indicates that for a case where the dataframes are not equal, the assertion fails because it is expecting `True` to be `False`. This discrepancy occurs due to a mistake in the implementation of the `equals` function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `Block` objects within the `BlockManager` are correctly compared for equality. We can use a different approach to compare the blocks, possibly comparing their contents instead of sorting based on dtype names and mgr_locs.

### Fixing the Bug:
We can address the bug in the `equals` function by modifying the block comparison method. Instead of sorting the blocks using dtype names and mgr_locs, we can directly compare the contents of the blocks to determine equality.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the function directly compares the individual blocks for equality without sorting them based on dtype names and mgr_locs. This should resolve the bug and make the function operate correctly.
