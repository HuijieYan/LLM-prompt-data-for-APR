### Potential Error Locations:
1. The comparison logic between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` seems to be incorrect, possibly due to the sorting mechanism.
2. The `canonicalize` function might not be handling the blocks correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug seems to be related to the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The issue might arise from the sorting done using the `canonicalize` function. If the sorting doesn't align correctly with the block contents, the comparison will fail. Additionally, the incorrect block order or unconsolidated blocks might lead to unexpected outcomes in the comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to ensure proper block identification for sorting.
2. Verify that the block sorting mechanism accounts for all relevant block attributes to avoid inconsistencies.
3. Check if any unconsolidated blocks impact the comparison and address them accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
        
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # Compare blocks based on specified attributes
    if set(map(type, self.blocks)) != set(map(type, other.blocks)):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x), x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (type(x), x.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues with the sorting mechanism and comparison logic between blocks, ensuring a successful comparison based on block attributes.
