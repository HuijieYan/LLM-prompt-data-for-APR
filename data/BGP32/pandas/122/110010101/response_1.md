### Analysis
1. The buggy function `equals(self, other)` compares two `BlockManager` objects in pandas by checking if their axes are equal and then comparing each block individually. 
2. The error message indicates that the comparison between two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `equals` method is assuming that the order of the blocks within each `BlockManager` is consistent, which may not be the case when comparing DataFrames. This results in the incorrect comparison outcome.
4. To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks within each `BlockManager` before comparing them to ensure a consistent order.
5. We need to modify the `equals` method by sorting the blocks using a canonicalization function before comparing them.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks within each `BlockManager` based on the defined canonicalization function, we ensure that the comparison between two `BlockManager` objects is consistent and correct. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
