The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the block order comparison between `self` and `other` BlockManagers. This comparison is done based on the block's dtype name and manager locations, but the bug stems from the fact that the dtype comparison does not handle the case when the dtypes are different.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns of different dtypes and values, leading to a failed equality comparison.
- The buggy function incorrectly assumes that the blocks can be compared solely based on the dtype and manager locations, leading to the incorrect result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to consider comparing blocks based on both dtype and the actual values they hold. 
- We should update the `canonicalize` function within the `equals` method to properly handle comparisons between different dtypes by including the actual block values in the comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected version of the `equals` function, it should now properly compare blocks based on both the dtype, values, and manager locations, addressing the bug highlighted by the failing test case.
