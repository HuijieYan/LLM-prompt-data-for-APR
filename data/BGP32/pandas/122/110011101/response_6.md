### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function stems from comparing `self.blocks` with `other.blocks` without considering the order of blocks. The function first sorts `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which creates a tuple with the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`. The issue arises when the dtype of blocks is different despite the contents being the same, leading to a false comparison.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the block's actual content rather than just the dtype. This change will ensure that blocks with the same content but different dtypes are recognized as equal.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected function properly compares the contents of blocks, ensuring correct equality evaluation.
