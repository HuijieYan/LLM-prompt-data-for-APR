### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is intended to check if two instances of `BlockManager` are equal by comparing their axes and blocks.
2. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks in the `BlockManager`. The error message indicates that the comparison is returning `True` when it should be `False`.
3. The issue likely arises from how the blocks are being sorted and compared without considering different types within each block.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly taking into account the types of the blocks.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the type of the block as well. This will ensure that blocks of different types are not incorrectly considered equal. Additionally, we need to update the comparison logic to compare blocks by their content as well as their type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
