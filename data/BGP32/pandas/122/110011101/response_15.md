### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between two DataFrame objects (`self` and `other`) at a block-level. The issue occurs when the blocks within the DataFrames are not in the correct order for comparison.

The bug is evident from the error message, where the expected output is `False` but the function returns `True`, indicating a false positive comparison result.

In the buggy function, the blocks within `self` and `other` DataFrames are sorted based on a `canonicalize` function which uses the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. If the block order within the DataFrames is different (e.g., due to different data types or locations), the comparison will fail incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the block order within the DataFrames (`self` and `other`) is consistent before comparing them. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks in a deterministic way that does not depend on block-specific attributes such as dtype or location.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks by their index values
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values.to_list())
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on their index values using the `values.to_list()` method to ensure a consistent block order for comparison. This approach should fix the bug and make the comparison between DataFrames more reliable.
