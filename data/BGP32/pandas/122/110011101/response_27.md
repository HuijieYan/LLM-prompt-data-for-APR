### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other`. The current implementation fails to correctly compare the blocks due to differences in their order, resulting in the assertion error.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to compare blocks without ensuring that they are ordered in a canonical way for comparison. This leads to different block orders between `self` and `other`, causing the `equals` function to return `True` incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared in a consistent order before making the comparison. This involves creating a stable sorting mechanism based on block characteristics.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this corrected function, the comparison now sorts blocks in a consistent order based on block type and locations. This ensures that the blocks are validly compared and the `equals` function can correctly determine if `self` and `other` are equal.
