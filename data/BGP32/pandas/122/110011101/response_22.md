The bug in the `equals` function arises from the inconsistency in comparing the data blocks between two `BlockManager` instances. The function checks the equality of data blocks using the `equals` method, but the `Block` object doesn't have an `equals` method implemented, leading to the AssertionError.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the block values directly within the `canonicalize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    
    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
        
        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            np.array_equal(block.values, oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected version, we use `np.array_equal` to compare the values of `Block` objects directly. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data within the blocks rather than using an undefined `equals` method. This change should fix the bug and make the function work as expected.
