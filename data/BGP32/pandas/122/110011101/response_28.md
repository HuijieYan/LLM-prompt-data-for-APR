### Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is due to a mismatch in the data values between `self` and `other` objects. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` failed, implying that the function is returning `True` even when the two objects are not equal.

Looking at the buggy function, the issue arises when comparing the blocks of `self` and `other`. The function first checks the equality of axes and then proceeds to compare individual blocks. However, the sorting of blocks using a custom function (`canonicalize`) may lead to misordering, causing incorrect comparisons.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are correctly sorted and compared. One approach could be to directly compare the blocks without sorting them. This eliminates the potential for incorrect comparisons due to sorting issues.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Directly compare the blocks without sorting
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, we ensure a consistent and correct comparison between the blocks of `self` and `other`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
