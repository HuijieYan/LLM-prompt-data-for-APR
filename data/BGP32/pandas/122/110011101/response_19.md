The bug in the provided `equals` function seems to stem from a mismatch in the comparison of columns between two `BlockManager` instances. The function is comparing the columns in the wrong order, leading to the assertion error in the failing test.

The expected behavior is that the function compares the columns in the correct order between the two `BlockManager` instances. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the columns are compared in the expected order.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.mgr_locs)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on `mgr_locs`, which helps in comparing the blocks correctly. This should resolve the issue with the failing test.
