### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises because the comparison between the data frames `df1` and `df2` is expected to result in False, indicating that the two data frames are not equal. However, the assertion fails due to unexpected behavior within the `equals` method.

The bug occurs because the implementation of the `BlockManager.equals` method does not properly handle the comparison of blocks within the data frames. The comparison logic currently sorts the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`, which can lead to incorrect results when comparing different data frames.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class should be updated to correctly compare the blocks in a more reliable manner. One approach to fix this bug is to iterate over the blocks in order and compare block by block, ensuring that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the block sorting order.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
        if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over blocks in the corrected code, we can ensure that each block is compared properly, leading to a correct comparison result between data frames.
