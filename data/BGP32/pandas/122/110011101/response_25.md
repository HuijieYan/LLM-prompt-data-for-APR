### Analysis:
The `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class is designed to compare two instances of `BlockManager`. It checks if the axes, blocks, and block content of the two instances are equal. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the correct result when comparing two different DataFrames.

### Issues:
1. The function is comparing the axes but then directly proceeds to compare the blocks. It should consolidate the axes before moving on to block comparison.
2. The canonicalization function is sorting the blocks by their dtype name and `mgr_locs`, but it fails to consider the content of the blocks for equality check.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Consolidate axes before block comparison to ensure proper alignment.
2. Include the block content comparison in the canonicalization function.
3. Compare the sorted blocks after considering dtype and block content for equality.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes) or not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version ensures that axes are consolidated before comparison and includes block content in the canonicalization function for proper block comparison.
