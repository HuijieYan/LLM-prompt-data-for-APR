### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method is caused by the comparison of the block order between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The comparison is based on sorting the blocks of each `BlockManager` instance by `canonicalize` function which is using `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. Since the dtype and mgr_locs may vary even if the actual data is the same due to different block arrangements, the comparison fails.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the comparison should be made based on the actual data in the blocks rather than sorting by dtype and mgr_locs. We can achieve this by comparing the values within each block directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    for block_label in self.blocks.keys():
        if block_label not in other.blocks:
            return False
        if not self.blocks[block_label].equals(other.blocks[block_label]):
            return False
            
    return True
```

With this corrected version, the comparison will now be made directly on the data within each block, ensuring that the `equals` method correctly checks if two `BlockManager` instances are equivalent.
