The bug in the `equals` function stems from the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison is based on the `equals` method, which checks for equality by comparing reference values instead of the actual contents. This leads to the function wrongly returning `True` even when the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` is done correctly by comparing the contents of each block instead of their references.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the blocks by their contents, ensuring that the function returns `False` when the DataFrames are different, passing the failing test.
