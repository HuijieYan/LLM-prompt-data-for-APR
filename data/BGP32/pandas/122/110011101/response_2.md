The issue in the buggy function is related to the comparison of DataFrame blocks within the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, which means that the function is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

The bug seems to be caused by incorrectly sorting and comparing the blocks. The function is not handling the comparison of the blocks correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared properly. We can use a different approach to sort and compare the blocks in a way that ensures accurate equality comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort and compare blocks
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values.dtype.name, x.values))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: (x.values.dtype.name, x.values))

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on the data type name and values before comparing them. This should address the issue with incorrect equality comparison and make the function return the expected result.
