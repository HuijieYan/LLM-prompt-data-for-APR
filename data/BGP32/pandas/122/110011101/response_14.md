The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between two DataFrames, where the column data types are not matching between `self` and `other`, leading to a False assertion even though the actual comparison is intended to be True.

### Bug in the Code:
The function compares the blocks of `self` and `other` directly, assuming that the order of blocks and their contents is the same in both DataFrames. If the column order or data types differ between `self` and `other`, the comparison will fail even if the actual data contents are equivalent.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to compare the DataFrames element-wise, ensuring that the data in corresponding positions is equivalent, regardless of the order of the blocks or the data types.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False
    
    if not self.axes.equals(other.axes):
        return False
    
    for self_col, other_col in self.iteritems():
        if not other[self_col].equals(other_col):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version compares the shape and axes of the DataFrames first. Then, it iterates through each column in `self` and compares it with the corresponding column in `other`. This ensures that the comparison is done element-wise, providing a more accurate check for DataFrame equality.
