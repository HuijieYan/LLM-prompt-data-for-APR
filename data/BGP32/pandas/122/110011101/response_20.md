### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The current buggy function is comparing two BlockManagers based on their axes and blocks, but the comparison logic is incorrect.
2. The bug occurs when comparing the blocks within the BlockManagers. Since the blocks may be unconsolidated, they need to be compared differently.
3. We need to handle the comparison of blocks more effectively, considering their unique characteristics.
4. To fix the bug, we should update the comparison logic inside the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks within the BlockManagers.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.dtype), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.values.equals(oblock.values) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version:
- We are now comparing the values within the blocks using the `values.equals` method to handle unconsolidated blocks properly.
- The `canonicalize` function now converts the block dtype to a string for comparison.
- The comparison in the `all` function has been updated to compare block values instead of the blocks themselves.

With these changes, the `equals` function should now properly compare two BlockManagers and pass the failing test.
