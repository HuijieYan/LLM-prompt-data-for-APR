The bug in the `equals` function is causing the assertion error in the failing test. The error occurs because the function is not correctly comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function checks if the lengths of `self_axes` and `other_axes` are equal, which is correct as they should have the same number of axes.
2. Next, it compares each axis in `self_axes` with the corresponding axis in `other_axes` using the `.equals` method. If any pair of axes are not equal, the function returns `False`.
3. After that, the function consolidates the blocks in `self` and `other` in place.
4. It then checks if the number of blocks in `self` is equal to the number of blocks in `other`. If not, it returns `False`.
5. The problematic part is when the function tries to canonicalize the blocks in `self` and `other` by sorting them. It uses a tuple combining the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block for comparison.
6. If any block in `self` does not exist in the same position in `other` based on the canonicalization criteria, the function incorrectly returns `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks between `self` and `other` is done correctly. Instead of relying on the `mgr_locs` for block comparison, we should compare the blocks based on their contents. This can be achieved by comparing the types and values of the blocks directly.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By comparing the blocks directly based on their types and values, the corrected function should pass the failing test and correctly check for equality between two `BlockManager` objects.
