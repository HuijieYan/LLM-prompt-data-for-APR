### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing the blocks within `self` and `other` instances. When comparing the blocks, the code is using the `equals` method on the blocks directly without considering the type information associated with the blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly compare the blocks based on their type and locations.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include the type information of the block, we can ensure that blocks of different types are not considered equal. This change will make the comparison more accurate and resolve the bug.
