### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` method stems from the comparison of block values in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The sorted blocks are currently compared directly using the `equals` method, but the comparison does not account for the block order in the lists, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison approach of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. One way to ensure correct comparison is to iterate over the blocks in order and compare them individually.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare blocks one by one to maintain order
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
``` 

The corrected version ensures that the blocks are compared in the order they appear in the sorted lists, providing a correct comparison result.
