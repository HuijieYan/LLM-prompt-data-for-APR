### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of the block order between two BlockManagers. It is comparing the blocks sorted by the dtype name and manager locations, but the dtype name is not an appropriate identifier of block similarity in this context.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Instead of comparing the blocks based on their dtype name, we should compare them based on their content.
2. We can achieve this by comparing the actual values within each block to determine equality between the two BlockManagers.
3. Once the blocks are sorted, we should iterate over the blocks and compare them element-wise to ensure their equality.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
This corrected version compares the blocks based on their actual values inside the blocks instead of using the dtype name, ensuring accurate block equality comparison.
