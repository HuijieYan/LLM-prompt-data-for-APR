### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch in the comparison of the blocks between two `BlockManager` objects. The function compares the blocks in self and other `BlockManager` objects without considering the order of blocks. This leads to incorrect results when comparing blocks of different types or unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `equals` function, we need to properly compare the blocks between two `BlockManager` objects considering the block type and the block locations. Sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that includes both the block type and block locations will ensure a consistent and correct comparison.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on a canonical representation that includes the block type and block locations, the corrected version of the `equals` function ensures a consistent and accurate comparison between two `BlockManager` objects.
