### Bug Explanation
In the `equals` function of the `BlockManager` class, the bug occurs due to a comparison mismatch between the two DataFrame objects, `self` and `other`. The issue arises because the function seeks to compare the underlying blocks of the DataFrame objects directly, leading to erroneous results.

1. The function compares the axes of the two DataFrame objects (`self` and `other`) first. If the lengths of the axes do not match, it returns `False`.
2. Next, it consolidates the blocks of both DataFrame objects in place.
3. Then, it compares the number of blocks in the two DataFrame objects. If the numbers do not match, it returns `False`.
4. It then sorts the blocks in both DataFrame objects based on a canonicalization function that combines the block's dtype name and `mgr_locs`.
5. Finally, it iterates over the sorted blocks of both DataFrame objects and checks if each block is equal.

The bug occurs because the function is comparing the blocks directly without considering the values of the blocks. In the failing test case, the expectation is that the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal, but the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the values within the blocks of the DataFrame objects rather than comparing the blocks themselves. By comparing the actual data values, we ensure a more accurate and meaningful comparison between the two DataFrames.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the values within the blocks instead of comparing the blocks directly
    equal_blocks = []
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        equal_blocks.append(block.values.equals(oblock.values))
    
    return all(equal_blocks)
```

By making this change, the corrected `equals` function now compares the values within the blocks of the DataFrame objects instead of comparing the blocks directly. This modification ensures that the function accurately determines the equality of the two DataFrames based on their actual data values.
