### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from comparing blocks in a non-consolidated state. The function first checks if the axes of the two `BlockManager` instances are equal, then proceeds to compare the blocks within them. However, before comparing the blocks, the function should first consolidate them to ensure that they are in a comparable state.

The error message indicates that the comparison between the blocks is incorrect, likely due to their elements not being correctly ordered for comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both `self` and `other` `BlockManager` instances are consolidated before comparing the blocks. This consolidation will align the internal data structures for comparison, resolving the issue with the equality check.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By calling `_consolidate_inplace()` on both `self` and `other` before comparing the blocks, we ensure that the blocks are aligned for comparison, resolving the bug and allowing the function to correctly determine equality between two `BlockManager` instances.
