### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between the blocks in the `self` and `other` instances of `BlockManager`. The comparison logic is incorrect when it comes to sorting and comparing the blocks. The blocks are being sorted based on their dtype names and manager locations, however, this logic is flawed and is causing the assertion to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `equals` function to sort the blocks correctly and compare them based on their contents rather than their dtype names and manager locations.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

By omitting the sorting and using the block order directly from `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly based on the block contents. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
