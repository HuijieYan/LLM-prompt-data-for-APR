### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison between two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` which have different data types in their columns. The comparison fails because the function is expecting the data types of the columns to match exactly in addition to the values. This discrepancy in data types causes the assertion error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to compare the values in each column regardless of their data types. We will compare the values of each column between the two DataFrames and return `False` if any of the columns do not match. By focusing on values rather than data types, we can ensure a successful comparison.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_data = self.get_data()
    other_data = other.get_data()
    
    return self_data.equals(other_data)
    
def get_data(self):
    data = []
    for block in self.blocks:
        data.append(block.values)
    return pd.concat(data, axis=1)
```

In the corrected version, we added a new method `get_data` to extract the values of each block in the `BlockManager`. Then, in the `equals` method, we compare the extracted data from both `self` and `other` objects to perform a value-based comparison. This change ensures that the comparison focuses on the values without being affected by the data types, resolving the bug causing the failed test.
