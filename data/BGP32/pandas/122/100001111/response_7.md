### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances to check if they are equal. However, the issue arises when identical blocks have different locations, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.

### Identified error locations:
1. The function compares block order using a tuple combining the type name and then `mgr_locs`. If there are unconsolidated blocks, they may have different locations, leading to false positives in the equality comparison.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the comparison logic based on block properties that may vary even for identical blocks due to different locations. This causes the function to incorrectly return `True` for instances that should be considered unequal.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to consider only the data contents of the blocks, ignoring the block locations.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    # Check if axes are equal
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    # Check if number of blocks is equal
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare block data without considering block locations
    self_blocks_data = [block.values for block in self.blocks]
    other_blocks_data = [block.values for block in other.blocks]

    return all(
        np.array_equal(block_data, other_data) 
        for block_data, other_data in zip(self_blocks_data, other_blocks_data)
    )
```

This corrected version focuses on comparing the actual values in the blocks rather than the blocks themselves, ensuring that the comparison is based on the contents of the blocks and not their locations.
