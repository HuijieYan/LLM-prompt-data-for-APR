### Analysis:
The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances to determine if they are equal. It first checks the equality of the axes (self_axes and other_axes), then consolidates inplace, compares the number of blocks, and finally iterates through the blocks while sorting them based on dtype and mgr_locs.

### Error location:
The issue arises in the `canonicalize` function, specifically in `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The `block.mgr_locs` datatype does not have an `as_array` attribute, leading to a runtime error.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function fails to handle the `block.mgr_locs` attribute correctly due to an invalid attribute access (`as_array`). This causes the function to crash and not return the expected result.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `block.mgr_locs` has an `as_array` attribute.
2. If not, handle `block.mgr_locs` properly to extract the necessary information for sorting.
3. Ensure that the comparison logic is intact after fixing the `canonicalize` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, str(block.mgr_locs))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version of the function handles the `block.mgr_locs` attribute properly by converting it to a string for sorting in the `canonicalize` function. This approach resolves the issue caused by the incorrect attribute access.
