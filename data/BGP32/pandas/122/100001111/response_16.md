### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise.
2. The function first checks if the number of axes in `self` and `other` is the same. Then, it iterates through each axis and invokes the `equals` method.
3. There are potential issues in collecting and comparing the blocks due to the incorrect implementation of `canonicalize` function, resulting in the function wrongly returning `True`.
4. In the given GitHub issue, the user expects the `equals` method to return `False` for two DataFrames with columns swapped, but the current implementation doesn't meet this expectation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to make sure the `canonicalize` function correctly captures the characteristics of each block for proper comparison.
2. Ensure that the function returns `False` when the blocks are not equal despite potential order differences.
3. Implement the fix while maintaining the functionality and expected behavior of the function.

### Bug Fixed Code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)  # Include block values for proper comparison
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to include block values along with location information, we ensure that even if the blocks have different locations, the equality check will consider the actual content of the blocks, addressing the issue specified in the GitHub report.
