### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function due to the comparison of `BlockManager` objects. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on type name and `mgr_locs`, leading to potential issues when comparing blocks. The sorting is done based on a custom key function `canonicalize`, but this may not accurately reflect the equality of blocks.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly. We should compare blocks based on their content rather than their type name and locations. This can be achieved by directly comparing the blocks without sorting them beforehand.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version directly compares the blocks in `self` and `other`, avoiding any sorting based on the type name or locations. This ensures that the comparison is done accurately based on block content.
