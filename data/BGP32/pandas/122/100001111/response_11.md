### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes, blocks, and block order. The issue arises when comparing blocks with different locations, which should not be considered equal. 

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `equals` function when comparing blocks using the `canonicalize` function which sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When sorting the blocks using `canonicalize`, the function only considers dtype name and manager locations, neglecting the actual data within the blocks.
2. Due to this sorting based solely on dtype and location, blocks with similar dtype but different data are considered equal, leading to incorrect results.
3. As a result, the function wrongly returns `True` in cases where blocks with different data but similar attributes are present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `canonicalize` function such that it considers the actual data within the blocks for sorting. This adjustment will ensure that blocks with different data are not incorrectly deemed equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())  # Sorting based on block values
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider the block values in addition to manager locations for sorting, the corrected function ensures that blocks with different data are correctly compared. This fix aligns with the expected behavior explained in the GitHub issue, resolving the bug in the `equals` function.
