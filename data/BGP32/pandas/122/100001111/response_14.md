The bug in the provided function `equals` needs to be fixed to address the issue where `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returns `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations. The buggy function compares different components of two `BlockManger` instances and returns `True` under certain conditions, leading to incorrect results.

### Error Locations:
1. The function compares the blocks of `self` and `other` instances directly without considering the block locations.
2. Sorting the blocks based on `dtype` and `mgr_locs` may not differentiate between blocks with different locations.
3. The `canonicalize` function used for sorting may not effectively handle unconsolidated blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the comparison of blocks without considering their actual positions within the data, leading to false positives in equality checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic to handle block locations effectively and ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are not treated as equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_slice())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and block.mgr_locs.equals(oblock.mgr_locs)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we sort the blocks based on `dtype`, `shape`, and `mgr_locs.as_slice()` to ensure a proper comparison that considers block locations. Additionally, we check both block equality and `mgr_locs` equality to handle any differences in block positions effectively.
