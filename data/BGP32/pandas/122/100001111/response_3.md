### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.
2. The comparison includes ensuring the length of axes matches, then comparing each axis, consolidating the objects, and finally comparing the blocks.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
4. From the provided runtime and expected values, the bug seems to originate from the comparison of blocks where the block order is not properly handled.

### Bug:
The bug arises from how the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which can result in incorrect sorting and subsequent comparison of blocks.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the sorting of blocks should consider individual elements for comparison instead of tuples. By sorting based on `dtype.name` first and then sorting based on `mgr_locs`, the function can correctly handle the comparison of blocks with different locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sorting blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs for correct comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By revising the `canonicalize` function to return a tuple consisting of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` directly without converting to a list, the corrected function should properly handle the comparison of blocks and resolve the bug reported on GitHub.
