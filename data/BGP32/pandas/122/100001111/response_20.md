### Analysis:
The `equals` function is comparing two instances of BlockManager and should return True only if the two BlockManagers have the exact same contents and layout. The current implementation has a sorting step using a `canonicalize` function that might not be preserving the correct order for comparing blocks. This leads to incorrect equality checks.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the use of the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This sorting might not preserve the correct order for comparing the blocks. As a result, even if the blocks are identical, the function returns False due to the ordering mismatch.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should remove the canonicalization step and directly compare the blocks without any reordering. This change will ensure that the equal blocks are correctly identified and will address the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing the sorting step and directly comparing the blocks, the corrected function will be able to accurately identify equal BlockManagers as intended.
