### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two `BlockManager` objects and return `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

### Error Locations:
1. The function constructs `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` by sorting the blocks based on `canonicalize`, which uses `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`. The bug could potentially be in the sorting mechanism or in the `canonicalize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, we see that the constructed `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` might have the wrong order due to the sorting mechanism. This discrepancy results in the `equals` function returning `False` even for identical blocks with different locations, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks is done correctly even when the blocks have different locations. The sorting mechanism should consider the content of the blocks rather than their locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # Compare the blocks within the BlockManager
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks based on content for comparison
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block[0].dtype.name, block[0].block.values.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(enumerate(self_blocks), key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(enumerate(other_blocks), key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block[1].equals(other_blocks[idx][1]) for idx, block in self_blocks
    )
```

In the corrected version, we compare the blocks directly using their content rather than their locations. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `equals` function behaves as expected.
