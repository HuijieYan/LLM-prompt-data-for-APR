### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is supposed to compare two instances of `BlockManager` (self and other) by their axes and blocks. The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.

#### Error Location:
The issue may be occurring in the comparison of blocks within `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from the ordering or location of blocks in `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`, resulting in false positives during the comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared accurately regardless of their ordering or locations within the `BlockManager`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.values.view(), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) 
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version includes a new `canonicalize` function that considers the block's dtype, values, and locations when sorting `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. This approach aims to address the incorrect comparison issues related to block ordering and locations specified in the GitHub issue.
