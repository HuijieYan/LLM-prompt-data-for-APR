### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is meant to compare two `BlockManager` instances. The issue arises from the comparison logic used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The comparison is based on the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs`. If two blocks have the same type but different locations, the function incorrectly returns `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function does not consider the block's actual content for equality comparison. It only considers the block's type name and `mgr_locs` for sorting, leading to false positives when blocks have identical types but different locations.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison logic should factor in the content of the blocks for equality. The sorting should be based on the block's actual values, not just the type and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def block_equals(block1, block2):
        if not block1.__class__.__name__ == block2.__class__.__name__:
            return False
        if not np.array_equal(block1.values, block2.values):
            return False
        return True
    
    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(block_equals(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

With this corrected version, the comparison of blocks now takes into account the actual content of the blocks, ensuring a more accurate assessment of equality.
