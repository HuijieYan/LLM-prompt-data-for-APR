### Analysis:
1. The `equals` function is comparing two `BlockManager` objects by checking if their axes are identical and then comparing each block within the managers.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison of blocks where the order matters due to the inconsistency in the location of blocks if the indices are not consolidated. This results in `True` being incorrectly returned when comparing managers with identical blocks but different locations.
3. The issue on GitHub describes a similar case where `equals` wrongly returns `True` for identical blocks with different locations.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure the blocks are sorted in a consistent order before performing the comparison.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort blocks using canonicalize function to ensure consistent order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks before comparing them, we ensure a consistent order based on the block's type and locations, preventing the bug where identical blocks with different locations would incorrectly return as equal.
