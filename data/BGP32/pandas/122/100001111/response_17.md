The bug in the `equals` function arises from the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, where the block's `mgr_locs` are converted to a list using `as_array.tolist()` method. This conversion to list leads to a loss of information regarding the block's actual location, causing the function to incorrectly return `True` for blocks with the same content but different locations.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider the `BlockPlacement` object `mgr_locs` rather than converting it to a list. By comparing the `mgr_locs` directly, we can ensure that blocks with the same content and the same location are considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order using dtype names and mgr_locs directly
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the block's locations are correctly considered in determining equality, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub report where blocks with different locations but identical contents were incorrectly marked as equal.
