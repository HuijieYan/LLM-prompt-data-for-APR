### Analysis
The buggy function `equals(self, other)` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects by checking their axes and blocks for equality. However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly return True for cases where identical blocks have different locations. This issue was reported on GitHub with a specific example where `df3.equals(df4)` erroneously returned True. 

### Identified Error
The bug occurs when comparing blocks based on their dtype name and manager locations, causing the function to return True incorrectly.

### Bug Cause
The bug originates from the sorting and comparison of blocks within the function. The function misidentifies blocks as equal when they have the same dtype but different manager locations. This results in incorrect equality assessment for BlockManager objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks within the `equals(self, other)` function. Instead of solely relying on dtype name and manager locations, we should ensure that identical blocks have matching content and positions.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def content_equals(block1, block2):
        return block1.equals(block2) and block1.mgr_locs == block2.mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()))
    
    return all(content_equals(block1, block2) for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

The corrected version of the `equals` function enhances the comparison logic for blocks by ensuring both dtype equality and identical manager locations. This modification addresses the bug reported on GitHub and ensures that the function accurately determines the equality of BlockManager objects.
