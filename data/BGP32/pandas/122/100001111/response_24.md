The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of blocks based on their locations. The function incorrectly returns `True` when comparing blocks with identical content but different locations. To fix this issue, we need to revise the comparison logic to ensure that blocks are compared accurately without considering their locations.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def sorted_block_values(blocks):
        return [block.values for block in blocks]

    self_block_values = sorted(sorted_block_values(self.blocks))
    other_block_values = sorted(sorted_block_values(other.blocks))

    return self_block_values == other_block_values
```

In the corrected version:
- We compare block values directly, without considering locations, by sorting the block values and then comparing them.
- This change ensures that the `equals` function accurately compares DataFrame blocks based on their contents rather than their locations, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

By implementing this correction, the `equals` function will now correctly return `False` when comparing blocks with the same content but different locations.
