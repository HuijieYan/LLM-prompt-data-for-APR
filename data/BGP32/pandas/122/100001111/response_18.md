### Analysis:
- The function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` instances based on their axes and blocks.
- The bug seems to be related to the comparison of blocks where different `BlockManager`s with identical blocks and different locations are incorrectly considered equal.

### Identified Error:
- The bug arises when sorting `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on a tuple of dtype name and manager locations.
- This sorting method can lead to blocks with identical data but different locations being considered unequal.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort blocks based on dtype name and manager locations.
2. If two blocks with identical data but different locations are encountered, they are considered different due to the sorting.
3. This results in the `equals` function returning `False` even when the blocks are conceptually equal.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Remove the sorting step based on dtype and locations to prevent the bug when comparing blocks.
- Directly compare the blocks without enforcing a specific order based on dtype and locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

### Changes Made:
- Removed the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on dtype name and manager locations.
- Directly compare blocks without enforcing a particular order.

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure the expected output in the failing test case.
