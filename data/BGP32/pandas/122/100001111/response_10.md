### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function compares two objects `self` and `other` based on their axes, blocks, and block contents. The bug arises from the sorting approach within the `canonicalize` function. This function sorts the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` values. When the dtype is identical, and only the location distinguishes the blocks, this comparison could lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to improve the `canonicalize` method to consider the block data itself in addition to `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. By including the block data in the comparison, we ensure that blocks with the same content but different locations are not incorrectly flagged as different.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding `block.values` to the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are now correctly identified as equal. This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and return the expected output.
