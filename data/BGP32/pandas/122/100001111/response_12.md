The bug in the provided function lies in the `canonicalize` function since it doesn't correctly handle comparing blocks with different locations. This results in the function `equals` wrongly returning `True` in cases where identical blocks have different locations.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to consider both the block dtype name and the block's content when comparing blocks. By using the `equals` method on `mgr_locs`, we can ensure that blocks with different locations but identical data are still considered equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, considering dtype and content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report and accurately compare blocks based on their dtype name and content.
