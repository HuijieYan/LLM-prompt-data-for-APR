### Bug Analysis:
1. The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` objects by checking their axes and blocks for equality.
2. The comparison logic involves sorting blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, and then checking for equality between corresponding blocks.
3. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False` for identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The issue might arise when comparing the blocks between `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects, particularly with unconsolidated blocks like Categorical.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug could occur due to the sorting based on `dtype name` and `mgr_locs`, which may not handle the unconsolidated blocks' differences adequately.
2. Unconsolidated blocks, like Categorical, might have identical content but different locations, leading to a false equality comparison.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the comparison logic to handle unconsolidated blocks more robustly, distinguishing based on content rather than locations.
2. Check for any additional conditions or factors that might impact the equality comparison between blocks.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x._validate_dtype().name)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x._validate_dtype().name)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if self_block.make_block_same_type(other_block).equals(other_block):
            continue
        return False

    return True
```

This corrected version focuses on handling unconsolidated blocks more effectively by comparing their content instead of relying solely on dtype name and mgr_locs.
