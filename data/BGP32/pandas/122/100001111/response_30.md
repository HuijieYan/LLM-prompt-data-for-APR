### Analysis:
- The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by comparing their axes and blocks.
- The bug seems to occur in the comparison of blocks where the function utilizes `canonicalize` to sort the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.
- The buggy behavior causes the function to return `True` even when blocks with different locations are identical, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by sorting the blocks solely based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, overlooking the actual content comparison of the blocks.
- The function does not consider comparing block data between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` includes comparing the actual block data in addition to sorting based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Sort self and other blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    # Compare sorted blocks based on dtype.name and mgr_locs
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By adding the actual comparison of block data in the corrected version, we ensure that the function correctly evaluates the equality of `BlockManager` objects even when blocks have different locations.
