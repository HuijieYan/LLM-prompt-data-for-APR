### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is incorrectly comparing the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. The issue arises when the blocks of the two objects have the same content but different locations. As per the GitHub issue mentioned, the expected behavior is for the function to return `False` in this case, but it erroneously returns `True`.

### Error Locations:
The bug is likely occurring due to the usage of the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on type name and `mgr_locs`. If the blocks have the same content but different locations, they will not be considered equal after sorting, leading to a false positive comparison.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function `canonicalize` sorts the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()`.
2. When two blocks have the same content but different locations, the sorting based on locations causes the comparison to be incorrect.
3. As a result, the function wrongly returns `True` even when the blocks are not truly equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the issue reported in GitHub, you can modify the comparison of blocks to consider their content rather than their locations. By ensuring that the content of the blocks is compared accurately, the function will return the correct result.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)  # Comparison based on block content
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)  # Comparison based on block content

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are now sorted based on the block values, ensuring that content comparison determines block equality. This modification addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
