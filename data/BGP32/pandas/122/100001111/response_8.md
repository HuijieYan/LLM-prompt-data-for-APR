### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The buggy function `equals` compares the axes, blocks, and their contents of two BlockManager objects. The issue arises when identical blocks exist in different locations, causing incorrect equality checks.
2. The bug occurs because the function does not consider the locations of the blocks when comparing them, leading to false positives in equality checks.
3. In the failed test scenario, the function incorrectly returns `True` for `df3.equals(df4)` when it should return `False`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to include block locations in the comparison process to ensure that identical blocks in different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `canonicalize` function to include block locations in the tuple used for block comparison.
2. Update the comparison logic to consider block locations while comparing blocks to ensure correct equality checks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Updated canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (
            block.dtype.name,
            block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(),
            hash(tuple(block.values.ravel()))
        )

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including block locations in the `canonicalize` function and updating the comparison logic, the corrected function now accurately identifies blocks with identical content but different locations as unequal, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
