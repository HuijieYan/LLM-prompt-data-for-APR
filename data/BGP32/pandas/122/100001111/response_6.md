### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `equals` is designed to compare two `BlockManager` objects for equality by checking if their axes are equal, then consolidating them and comparing their blocks. The bug seems to arise from sorting the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, which causes identical blocks with different locations to be incorrectly recognized as unequal.

### Error Location
The error likely stems from the `canonicalize` function where the blocks are sorted.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided runtime values, the `self` and `other` `BlockManager` objects have the same axes and blocks but with different block locations. Since the blocks are sorted based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, even though the contents are equal, the sorting order causes the function to incorrectly detect them as unequal.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the issue, we need to modify the comparison logic for the blocks. Instead of sorting them based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`, we can directly compare the blocks without altering their order.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By directly comparing the blocks without sorting, we ensure that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal. This corrected version should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
