### Analysis:
- The `equals` function compares two `BlockManager` instances by checking if their axes are of the same length, and then iterates through their blocks to check if they are equal.
- The bug seems to be related to comparing blocks with different locations even if their data is the same.
- The provided tests show that two identical DataFrames with blocks in different locations are wrongly returning `True` for equality.

### Error Location:
- The bug is likely in the comparison of the blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function is used to sort the blocks based on type names and locations, but the location comparison may be causing the incorrect equality results.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because different DataFrames with their blocks in different locations are considered equal due to the sorting of blocks based on type names and locations.
- The sorting algorithm is not distinguishing similar blocks in different locations, leading to incorrect equality comparison.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, instead of sorting based on block locations, it would be better to compare blocks directly without considering their locations.
- We should modify the sorting logic to only consider the type names while comparing blocks for equality.
- This will ensure that blocks with the same data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.dtype.name

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By removing the consideration of block locations in the sorting logic, the corrected version focuses only on comparing blocks based on their type names. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
