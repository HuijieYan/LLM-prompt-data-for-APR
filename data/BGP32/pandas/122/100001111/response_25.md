### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` is comparing two BlockManager instances by checking their axes and blocks for equality. The issue arises when consolidating the blocks by sorting and comparing them using the `equals` method. In the failing test case, the function incorrectly returns True when it should return False due to identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the comparison of blocks. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their data types and locations, but it fails to consider the actual block data.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function only considers column names and block locations, not the actual block data. Due to this oversight, blocks with different data but similar names and locations are considered equal, leading to an incorrect result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to include the block data in the comparison process. Instead of solely relying on dtype and mgr_locs, we should compare the block data as well. This will ensure that blocks with identical data but different locations are correctly identified as unequal.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the `block.values` in the `canonicalize` function, we ensure that the comparison includes the actual block data. This modification addresses the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensures that blocks with different data are correctly identified as unequal.
