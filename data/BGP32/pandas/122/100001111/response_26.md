### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` compares two BlockManager objects by iterating over their axes and blocks. The issue arises when it compares the blocks within the BlockManager. It fails to correctly identify blocks with identical data but different locations due to using a sorting approach that doesn't consider the actual data equivalence.

### The Bug:
The bug occurs in the sorting step where it sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This sorting method undermines the comparison of blocks based on their actual data content, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism to prioritize comparing the actual data values in the blocks rather than their specific locations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tobytes()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, we use the `tobytes()` method to create a unique representation of the block's data, allowing proper comparison of blocks based on their content. This change ensures that identical blocks with different locations are correctly identified as equal.
