### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals` compares two `BlockManager` objects by sorting their blocks based on the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. The bug is causing the function to return incorrect results when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `canonicalize` function that sorts the blocks based on `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs`. This approach might not correctly handle blocks with the same content but different locations.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `equals` function to incorrectly return `True` when comparing `BlockManager` objects with identical blocks but different locations, violating the expected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to refine the comparison mechanism between blocks. Instead of using `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` for sorting, we should directly compare the content of the blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

This corrected version eliminates the unnecessary sorting based on block properties and directly compares the blocks' content, ensuring a more accurate comparison.
