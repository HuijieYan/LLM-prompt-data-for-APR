### Analysis:
The buggy function `equals()` is intended to compare two BlockManager objects by checking if their axes, blocks, and block contents are equal. However, the bug occurs when the function incorrectly returns True even when the blocks have the same content but different locations.

### Identified Bug:
The bug arises in the canonicalization process within the function. The `canonicalize()` function uses the block's dtype name and mgr_locs, which can be problematic if blocks have the same content but different locations due to unconsolidated blocks.

### Bug Cause:
In the provided test case, both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` have the same content but are located differently. The function fails to handle this case correctly due to the sorting based on dtype name and mgr_locs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize()` function to consider the content of the blocks rather than just their dtype name and locations. By ensuring that block equality is determined based on the block content rather than their locations, we can fix the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, `canonicalize()` now returns the block's values instead of dtype name and mgr_locs. This change allows the function to correctly compare blocks based on their content, resolving the issue of returning True for identical blocks with different locations.
