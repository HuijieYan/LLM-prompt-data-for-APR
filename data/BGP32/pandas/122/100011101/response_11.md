The bug in the function `equals` is causing the assertion error in the failing test. The error message indicates that the comparison between two dataframes `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is returning `True` when it should be `False`.

### Analysis:
1. The function compares the axes of two BlockManager instances (`self` and `other`). If the lengths of the axes are different, it returns `False`, which seems correct.
2. The function then iterates over the blocks of the two BlockManagers in a specific order defined by the `canonicalize` function and compares each pair of blocks. The error likely occurs during this comparison.

### Bug in the code:
The bug lies in how the function compares the blocks. It is sorting the blocks based on the `canonicalize` function, which considers the block's data type and manager locations. However, this sorting doesn't take into account the actual data within the block, resulting in incorrect comparisons.

### Fix strategy:
We need to modify the comparison logic to consider the actual data within the blocks when checking for equality.

### Corrected code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes

    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def compare_blocks(block, oblock):
        if block.shape != oblock.shape:
            return False
        if block.values.equals(oblock.values):
            return True
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(compare_blocks(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the corrected code, a new `compare_blocks` function is introduced to compare the actual values within the blocks. It checks if the shapes match and then compares the values. This ensures that the equality comparison correctly considers the data within the blocks.

By making this change, the function should now correctly determine if two BlockManagers are equal based on their axes and block values.
