The buggy function is the `equals` method in the `BlockManager` class. The function is intended to check if two `BlockManager` instances are equal by comparing their axes, blocks, and block contents.

The error message in the failing test asserts that `df1.equals(df2)` should return `False` but instead is evaluating to `True`.

After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, we can see that the function is correctly comparing the axes and the number of blocks in the `BlockManager` instances (`self` and `other`). However, the comparison of the individual blocks is flawed. The function sorts the blocks using a custom `canonicalize` function that compares the block's dtype name and manager locations. This sorting is done for both `self` and `other` blocks, and then each pair is compared using the `equals` method of the blocks.

The bug seems to arise from the fact that the function is comparing blocks directly after sorting them, which may lead to incorrect comparisons due to different sorting orders. This can be seen in the failing test where the block contents are actually different, but due to incorrect block sorting, the function thinks they are equal.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly. One way to achieve this is to sort the blocks using a consistent method and then iterate over them while comparing. We should not solely rely on sorting based on dtype name and manager locations as it might not guarantee the correct order for comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks_sorted = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block._index)
    other_blocks_sorted = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block._index)
    
    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks_sorted, other_blocks_sorted))
```

In this corrected version, we sort the blocks based on a consistent key (`block._index`), ensuring a deterministic order for comparison. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the blocks are compared correctly.
