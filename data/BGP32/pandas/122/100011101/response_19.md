### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the assertion error in the failing test. The error message shows that `True` is being compared against `False`, which indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`.

The buggy function compares the axes of two `BlockManager` objects and then proceeds to compare the blocks within those managers. The bug occurs in the comparison of blocks because the method `canonicalize` is defining a tuple based on the block's dtype.name and mgr_locs.

The bug arises from the fact that the dataframe df1 and df2 in the failing test have columns in a different order, which results in categorized blocks switching places. This leads to a mismatch in the order of blocks during the comparison.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are compared correctly even if their order is different. One way to achieve this is by sorting the blocks based on the block's values rather than the dtype and mgr_locs. By sorting the blocks based on their actual values, we can ensure that the comparison is valid even if the order of blocks changes.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on values for proper sorting
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on their values in the corrected version, the function should now correctly compare the dataframes even if the blocks are in different order, hence passing the failing test.
