### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the comparison of the two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` using the `.equals()` method. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` when it should have returned `False`. This occurs because the `df1` and `df2` DataFrames have the same columns (['a', 'b']) but the values in the columns are in a different order.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the values in each block along with the block dtype and mgr_locs. By including the actual values along with dtype and mgr_locs, we can ensure that even if the order of values in the columns is different, the comparison will still correctly identify the DataFrames as not equal.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using the block values, dtype name, and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values.tolist(), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the block comparison considers the values within the blocks along with dtype and mgr_locs, allowing for correct identification of inequality even if the values are in a different order.
