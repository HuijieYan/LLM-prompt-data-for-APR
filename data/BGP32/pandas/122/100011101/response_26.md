### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function defined within the `equals` method is not comparing the blocks correctly. The issue lies in how the `block` and `oblock` variables are used in the comparison. The `block` and `oblock` variables are extracted from sorted `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, respectively, using `zip` function. However, the extraction doesn't match the correct order of blocks because the `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their type name and then manager locations. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should modify the `canonicalize` function to return the type name and manager locations for comparison correctly. This way, the blocks will be sorted and compared in the correct order.

### Corrected Code
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By correcting the `canonicalize` function to return the type name and manager locations, we ensure that the blocks are sorted and compared in the correct order, fixing the bug.
