### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function arises from incorrectly comparing the content of two `DataFrame` objects. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` are two `DataFrame` objects with columns 'a' and 'b' containing different data types. These two `DataFrame` objects are being compared using the `equals` method, which should return `False` as their content is not the same.

However, due to the bug in the function, it is not properly handling the comparison of different data types in the columns. It assumes that the two `DataFrame` objects should be considered equal based on the order of columns, which is incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `equals` function to properly handle the comparison of columns with different data types in `DataFrame` objects. We should compare each row of the `DataFrame` objects to determine their equality, ensuring that the comparison also accounts for differences in data types of columns.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    if self.shape != other.shape:
        return False

    # Compare the values of each cell in the DataFrames
    for col in self.columns:
        if not self[col].equals(other[col]):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected function compares the shapes of the two `DataFrame` objects first to check if they are equal. Then, it iterates over each column and compares the values in all rows to determine if the `DataFrame` objects are equal.

This should fix the bug and make the function handle the comparison of `DataFrame` objects with different data types correctly.
