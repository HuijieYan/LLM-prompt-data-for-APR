### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `equals` method is being called on the DataFrame itself (`df1.equals(df2)`), which compares the whole DataFrame object as a single unit, rather than comparing the contents column-wise. This results in the assertion error where `True` is compared to `False`. The error message highlights that the comparison is happening on the whole DataFrame object, not the contents.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the columns of the DataFrames instead of comparing the DataFrames as a whole. This can be achieved by comparing the columns one by one.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    for column in self:
        if not self[column].equals(other[column]):
            return False
    
    return True
```

This corrected version iterates through each column in `self` and compares it to the corresponding column in `other`. It returns `False` immediately if any column is not equal, and `True` only if all columns are equal. This approach aligns with comparing the DataFrame contents correctly.
