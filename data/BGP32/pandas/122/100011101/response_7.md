### Bug Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` instead of `False` when comparing two DataFrames that are not equal. This likely occurs due to incorrect comparison or sorting within the function.

The function compares the axes of two BlockManagers first, then checks if all blocks are equal between them. However, the sorting logic for blocks to be compared may be incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the axes of both BlockManagers are compared correctly.
2. Verify that the blocks within the BlockManagers are sorted consistently for comparison.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block._merge_locs())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By ensuring proper sorting of blocks using `_merge_locs()` and comparing the axes correctly, the corrected function should now return the expected result.
