The bug in the provided function `equals` is likely due to the incorrect comparison of values between `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`. The function attempts to sort `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function, which includes the block's dtype name and manager locations. However, the issue arises because the dtype names are being compared without regard for their actual values. In the failing test case, due to the differing data types in the DataFrame columns between `df1` and `df2`, the function erroneously concludes that the DataFrames are equal when they are not.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to also consider the values within the blocks for comparison. By incorporating the block's data into the sorting logic, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies differences in DataFrames with various data types.

Here is the corrected version of the function `equals`:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the block's values in the `canonicalize` function for sorting, the function should now correctly compare the DataFrames even when the columns have different data types. This correction should address the issue and make the function behave as expected.
