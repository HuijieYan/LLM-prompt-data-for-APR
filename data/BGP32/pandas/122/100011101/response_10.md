### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is the `equals` method of a class that compares two instances of BlockManager. The error message indicates that the comparison `df1.equals(df2)` unexpectedly returned `True` instead of `False`. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the comparison logic for the two BlockManager objects.

The function compares the axes of two BlockManager instances and then compares the blocks within each BlockManager. The issue arises when sorting the blocks based on a 'canonicalize' function that combines the type name and the locations. If the blocks are not correctly sorted, the comparison may fail even if the BlockManager instances are logically equivalent.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are sorted properly before comparing them. One approach is to compare the block lengths first and then sort and compare the blocks based on their content. Additionally, we need to make sure that the comparison logic considers all aspects of the BlockManager instances to determine equality accurately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()

    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False

    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the blocks are sorted based on their values before being compared. Additionally, it compares the lengths of the blocks to confirm that they are equal before verifying each block's equivalence. This approach should address the issue and pass the failing test case.
