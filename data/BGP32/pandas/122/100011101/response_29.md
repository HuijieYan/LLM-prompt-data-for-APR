### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the function `equals` when comparing two DataFrames using the `equals` method. The error message indicates that the comparison returns `True` instead of the expected `False`. This occurs because the method fails to correctly compare the two DataFrames due to column swapping in the input DataFrames.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the comparison step where it checks if the blocks are equal between the two DataFrames after sorting the blocks based on `block.dtype.name` and `block.mgr_locs`.

### Bug Explanation:
- The input DataFrames `df1` and `df2` contain the same data but with column swapping. This results in the sorted blocks within the function to be different from each other.
- The comparison step fails to account for the column swapping, leading to incorrect results. This causes the function to return `True` instead of the expected `False`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to consider the column order when comparing the blocks of the DataFrames. One possible strategy is to use the column names as keys for sorting the blocks, ensuring that columns are matched correctly during comparison.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the column name
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.mgr_locs

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on the column order represented by `block.mgr_locs`, the corrected code ensures that the comparison is done correctly, considering the correct mapping between columns of the two DataFrames.
