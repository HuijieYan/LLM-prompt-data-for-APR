### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from how the `canonicalize` function is used to sort `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The `canonicalize` function currently returns a tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())`. This approach can lead to incorrect sorting because `block.dtype.name` is not unique for different types of blocks like `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to include more unique identifiers that differentiate between different block types. One way to accomplish this is by generating a unique ID for each block based on its type and location.

### Corrected Version
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # updated canonicalize function to provide a better sorting key
    def canonicalize(block):
        block_type = type(block).__name__
        mgr_locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()
        return (block_type, mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to use the block type along with a unique identifier like `mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes()`, we ensure a more accurate sorting mechanism that can handle different block types correctly. This approach should address the sorting issue and fix the bug in the `equals` function.
