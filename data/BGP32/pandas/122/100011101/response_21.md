### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `equals()` is designed to compare two BlockManager objects for equality. However, the bug arises from the comparison logic within the function. The function compares the blocks of the two BlockManagers based on their order and data types, which may result in incorrect comparisons in certain cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic within the function. Instead of relying on the order of blocks and data types, we should compare the actual data in each block to determine equality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not self_block.equals(other_block):
            return False

    return True
```

By iterating over the blocks of the BlockManagers and comparing each block's content directly, we ensure a more accurate comparison for equality. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
