### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises when comparing two DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) using the `equals` method. The error message shows that the assertion `assert df1.equals(df2) is False` fails, indicating that the method is returning `True` when it should return `False`.

The buggy function compares the axes of the two DataFrames, then consolidates and sorts the blocks within each DataFrame before comparing them. The bug likely stems from the sorting process, as it uses a custom key function `canonicalize` that combines the type name and `mgr_locs` of each block. This can lead to incorrect block order comparison, causing the method to return `True` erroneously.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the blocks are sorted in the `canonicalize` function. Instead of relying on a combination of type name and `mgr_locs`, we should prioritize comparing the actual data within the blocks. By properly comparing the data stored in the blocks, the `equals` method should return the correct result.

### Corrected Version of the `equals` Function

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order based on their actual data content
    def canonicalize(block):
        return block.values.tostring()

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By using the `values` attribute of each block to compare the actual data content instead of a mixture of type name and location, the corrected version of the `equals` function should now return the correct result when comparing the DataFrames.
