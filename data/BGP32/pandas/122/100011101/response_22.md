### Analysis:
The buggy function is the `equals` method for comparing two instances of `BlockManager`. The error message shows the test case where the method fails to correctly determine that two DataFrames are not equal.

The function compares the axes of the two BlockManagers and then proceeds to compare the blocks in a sorted manner. The bug seems to stem from the comparison of blocks, causing the function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

### Bug:
The bug arises from the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function. This sorting does not correctly compare the content of the blocks, leading to the function erroneously concluding that the two BlockManagers are equal.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the content of the blocks is compared properly rather than just relying on sorting. We can modify the `equals` method to directly compare the blocks without sorting by using the original order of blocks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By comparing the blocks without sorting, we ensure that the content is properly evaluated for equality, addressing the issue and passing the failing test case.
