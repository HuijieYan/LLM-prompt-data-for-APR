### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function used for sorting the blocks is not properly handling blocks with different types (int64 and object). This causes a mismatch in block ordering between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, leading to the function incorrectly returning `True` when comparing the two dataframes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to properly handle blocks with different types. One possible strategy is to include the block type in the tuple for sorting to ensure consistent ordering.

### Corrected Version

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs to handle different block types
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the `canonicalize` function to include the block type in the sorting tuple, the corrected version ensures consistent block ordering, fixing the bug that caused the failing test.
