### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison of DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method. The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the assertion that `df1.equals(df2)` should be `False` failed, leading to the failed test.

The buggy function `equals` compares the internal structures of two BlockManager objects representing DataFrames. However, it does not correctly compare the values within each block of the DataFrames. In this specific case, the DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` have different values which are not being properly compared by the `equals` function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `equals` function compares the actual values within each block of the DataFrames, rather than just the structure. We can modify the comparison logic to iterate over the actual data values instead of comparing the blocks directly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare the actual values within each block
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.values_equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected version, we iterate over the blocks and compare the actual data values using a new method `values_equals` which should compare the values within the blocks.

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly compare the DataFrames and pass the failing test.
