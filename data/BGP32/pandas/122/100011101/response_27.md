### Bug Explanation:
The buggy `equals` function fails because it compares the columns of two DataFrames in a way that does not consider the order of the columns. In the failing test case, `df1` and `df2` have the same columns ('a' and 'b') but in a different order. The function does not account for this difference and incorrectly returns `True` instead of `False`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the columns in `self` and `other` DataFrames are equal regardless of their order. One way to achieve this is to first sort the columns before comparing them.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = sorted(self.axes), sorted(other.axes)
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

After applying this correction, the `equals` function will properly compare DataFrames regardless of the order of their columns, and the failing test should pass successfully.
