### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from the comparison of two DataFrames (`self` and `other`) using the `equals` method. In the failing test case, the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` have columns with different data types but similar column names. However, the `equals` method does not account for columns with different data types.

The error message `assert True is False` indicates that the function incorrectly returns `True` when it should return `False` due to the data type mismatch in the columns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `equals` method to compare the columns while considering their data types as well. Instead of directly comparing the columns, we should compare the column names first and then check if the data types are the same before comparing the values.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: x.get_values().dtype)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: x.get_values().dtype)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected version will now compare the blocks based on their data types while ensuring that the columns are compared correctly, accounting for the data type differences between columns.
