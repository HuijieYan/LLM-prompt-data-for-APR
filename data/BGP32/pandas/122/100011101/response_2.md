### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `equals` function is causing the assertion error because the function is incorrectly comparing two DataFrames based on their column values. The issue arises from the fact that the function is comparing the columns directly without considering the column order. The function uses the `all` method with `zip` to iterate over the blocks and check if they are equal. However, this comparison does not take into account the order of columns in the DataFrames, which leads to a false assertion even though the DataFrames are different only in column order.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider the columns' order and compare the DataFrames correctly. One way to solve this is to sort the columns before comparison.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

With this correction, the function will properly sort the blocks based on type and location information, ensuring that the comparison between DataFrames considers the column order as well. This should resolve the assertion error and make the function behave correctly when comparing DataFrames.
