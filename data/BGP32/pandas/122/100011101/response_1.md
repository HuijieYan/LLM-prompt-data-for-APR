The buggy function `equals` is comparing two instances of `BlockManager` but has an issue with handling the comparison of the blocks within each `BlockManager`. The comparison is intended to be based on the blocks within the `BlockManager` instance, but the function is mistakenly comparing the order of the blocks between the two instances.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert True is False` is failing, which implies that the comparison result is unexpectedly True when it should be False. This error scenario is triggered because the function is not correctly comparing the content of the blocks inside the `BlockManager` instances.

To fix this bug, we should refactor the `equals` function to compare the content of the blocks within the `BlockManager` instances instead of their order. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: hash(tuple(block.values)))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: hash(tuple(block.values)))
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected version, the blocks are sorted based on the hash of their values, ensuring that the comparison is focused on the content of the blocks. This approach should address the bug and make the function compare the blocks' content correctly.

Please test the corrected function with the failing test case to verify if it now passes successfully. Let me know if you encounter any issues.
