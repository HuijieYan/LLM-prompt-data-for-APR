### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `equals` function arises from a mismatch between the actual behavior of comparing two DataFrames and the expected behavior. The function is comparing the DataFrames based on their columns and blocks without taking into account the data types of the columns. This results in an erroneous comparison and the function returning `True` when it should return `False`, leading to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic in the `equals` function to consider not only the column names but also the data types of the columns. We should compare the data types of corresponding columns in addition to the column names to determine if two DataFrames are equal.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # compare dataframes by column names and data types
    if set(self.columns) != set(other.columns):
        return False
    for col in self.columns:
        if self[col].dtype != other[col].dtype:
            return False
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By including the comparison of column data types along with column names in the corrected version of the function, it should now accurately determine if two DataFrames are equal.
