The bug in the provided function is related to how the blocks are sorted and compared for equality. The function is currently sorting the blocks based on dtype name and manager locations. This approach is incorrect for comparing dataframes since the order of columns matters.

To fix the bug, we need to sort the blocks based on the column names before comparing them for equality. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # sort blocks based on column names
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda x: list(x.mgr_locs.index))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda x: list(x.mgr_locs.index))

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By sorting the blocks based on column names, we ensure that the comparison is done correctly. This fix should address the failing test case provided.
