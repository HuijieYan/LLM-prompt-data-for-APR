The bug in the provided function is that it is comparing blocks in a way that is not robust. The error message indicates that the comparison of DataFrame objects `df1` and `df2` using the `equals` method is not returning the expected value.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function `equals` arises from the comparison of blocks in `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. The comparison is based on the order of blocks sorted by `canonicalize` function which combines the data type name and `mgr_locs`. This can lead to incorrect comparison results since the order might not necessarily align with actual data comparison.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic to compare blocks directly without relying on their order. We can iterate over both `self.blocks` and `other.blocks` simultaneously and compare corresponding blocks for equality.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Compare blocks one by one
    for block, oblock in zip(self.blocks, other.blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

By directly comparing corresponding blocks without relying on the order of blocks, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test scenario and provide the expected output.
