### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function is attempting to check the equality of two BlockManager objects by comparing their axes and blocks. However, in the comparison of the blocks, the function is using a sorting mechanism that does not account for the actual values within the blocks. As a result, the comparison may fail even when the contents of the blocks are equal.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the sorting mechanism used for comparing the blocks. Instead of sorting based on dtype.name and mgr_locs, we should aim to compare the actual values within the blocks.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = self.blocks
    other_blocks = other.blocks
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
``` 

By making this change, we compare the actual values within the blocks directly, ensuring that the equality check is based on the content of the blocks rather than their types or locations. This corrected version should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
