### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function attempts to convert NaT values (Not-a-Time values) of datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype to an integer, which is not allowed.
- The error message indicates that the function should raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer," but it fails to do so.
- The relevant GitHub issue mentions a similar scenario where converting categorical data with NaN values to integers resulted in unexpected negative integers.

### Error Location
- The bug occurs when the function encounters NaT values in the input array of datetime64 or timedelta64 dtype and tries to cast them to int64 dtype.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the missing check for NaT values in the input array of datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype before attempting to cast them to integer types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Add a check to verify if the input array contains NaT values before attempting to cast them to integer types.
- Raise a ValueError with an appropriate message if NaT values are encountered during the conversion.

### Corrected Function
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same
```

- By adding a check for NaT values in datetime64 and timedelta64 arrays, we prevent the function from attempting an invalid conversion, fixing the bug and aligning the behavior with the expected output.
- This corrected version should address the issue raised in the failing test and potentially resolve the problem described in the GitHub issue related to converting categorical data with NaN values to integers.
