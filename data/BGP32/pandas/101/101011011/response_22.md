### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` has an issue when trying to convert NaN values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types to integers, which is resulting in a `ValueError` in the failing tests.

The specific cases causing the failure are when `arr` contains NaN values of datetime64 or timedelta64 types and is attempted to be cast to `np.int64`. The function is not handling this scenario correctly and is leading to the error.

### Bug Location:
The bug arises in the logic block handling the conversion of datetime64 and timedelta64 types. When NaN values are encountered, the function attempts to convert them to integers, causing the `ValueError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The initial value in the failing tests for `val` is `numpy.datetime64('NaT')` and `numpy.timedelta64('NaT')`, both representing the NaT (Not a Time) value. The goal is to convert these NaT values to the integer type `np.int64`. However, the function lacks the necessary logic to handle this scenario, resulting in the error message indicating the inability to convert NaN values to integer.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check for NaN values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types and handle them appropriately instead of trying to convert them directly to `np.int64`. We can modify the logic inside the function to first handle these special cases before proceeding with the casting.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if isna(arr):
        if is_datetime64_dtype(arr):
            if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
                return np.nan

        if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
            if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
                return np.nan

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

By adding the conditional checks for NaN values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types at the beginning of the function, we can correctly handle these cases and avoid the `ValueError`.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test and the related GitHub issues regarding the conversion of NaN values to integers.
