### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to safely cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The function checks the dtype and array types to handle datetime, timedelta, object, and other data types properly.
   
2. The failing test is trying to cast a `NaT` value with type `datetime64` or `timedelta64` to an integer, which results in an incorrect negative value instead of raising a `ValueError` as expected.

3. The buggy function incorrectly handles the case when trying to convert `NaT` values to an integer, resulting in unexpected negative integer values. This issue is directly related to the failing test.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the function to properly handle the case when trying to convert `NaT` values to an integer.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of `NaT` values when trying to convert them to an integer. The buggy function attempts to convert `NaT` values to integer but doesn't raise an error, leading to unexpected negative integer values.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to properly raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert `NaT` values to an integer. By raising a `ValueError` in this case, the function will behave as expected and pass the failing tests.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if pd.isnull(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding the condition to raise a `ValueError` if `NaT` values are encountered during conversion, the function will now handle this case correctly and pass the failing tests.
