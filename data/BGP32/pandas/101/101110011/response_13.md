### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It checks for various conditions based on the dtype and handles the casting accordingly.
2. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` is testing the conversion of `NaT` values (Not a Time, represents missing values in datetime and timedelta) to an integer. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to a failure in the test.
3. The error occurs because the function does not properly account for the case where `NaT` values need to be converted to integer type. This results in a failure to raise a `ValueError` as expected in the test.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `NaT` values are involved and need to be converted to integer type.
5. In this corrected version, we will specifically handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integer type correctly.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs import lib, tslib
from .common import _INT64_DTYPE, _TD_DTYPE, ensure_object, is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        mask = tslib.is_missing(arr)
        result = np.empty(arr.shape, dtype=dtype)
        result[~mask] = arr[~mask].astype(dtype)
        result[mask] = np.nan
        return result

    return arr.astype(dtype, copy=copy, errors='raise')

```

This corrected version handles the conversion of `NaT` values to integer type for datetime and timedelta arrays correctly. It uses `tslib.is_missing` to identify missing values like `NaT` and then assigns them as `np.nan` in the result. Other values are cast to the required dtype.

By implementing this correction, the function should now correctly handle the scenario where `NaT` values need to be converted to an integer type for datetime and timedelta arrays.
