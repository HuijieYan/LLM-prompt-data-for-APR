The bug in the provided function `astype_nansafe` is related to the check for being an extension dtype after the dtype is converted to a pandas dtype. This check should be done before the dtype conversion.

1. Analyzing the potential error locations:
   - The issue arises when the dtype is converted to a pandas dtype, and then the function checks if it's an extension dtype. This check should happen before the conversion to maintain consistency in the handling of extension dtypes.

2. Potential error cause:
   - The current order of checking if the dtype is an extension dtype after converting it to a pandas dtype might lead to inconsistency or unexpected behavior.

3. Bug explanation:
   - The bug occurs due to the incorrect order of operations of checking for the extension dtype condition, leading to potential issues when handling extension dtypes.

4. Suggested fix strategy:
   - Move the check for an extension dtype before converting the original dtype to a pandas dtype to ensure consistency in handling.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not to skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed before converting to pandas dtype
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # Continue with existing logic...
```

In the corrected version, the check for being an extension dtype is moved before the conversion to a pandas dtype to ensure that the correct dtype handling is maintained consistently.
