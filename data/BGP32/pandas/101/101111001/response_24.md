The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function arises from the incorrect handling of NaT values (Not a Time) in the input array when converting to an integer type. The current implementation does not account for this scenario, causing the ValueError to not be raised as expected.

### Bug Explanation:
When the input array contains NaT values and needs to be converted to an integer type, the function should raise a ValueError to indicate that it cannot convert these non-finite values (NA or inf) to an integer. However, the current implementation lacks this check, leading to the failing test cases reported.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check for non-finite values (including NaT) in the array when converting to an integer type. If any non-finite values are found, we should raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By incorporating the check for non-finite values as described above, the function should now correctly handle cases where NaT values are present in the input array when converting to an integer type. This fix should address the failing test cases.
