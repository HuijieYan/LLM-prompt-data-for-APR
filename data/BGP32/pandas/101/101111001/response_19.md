The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it raises a `ValueError` when trying to convert NaT (Not-a-Time) values to an integer, but it fails to handle this scenario correctly.

The issue arises when the input array contains NaT values and the target dtype is an integer (`np.int64`). The function should handle this case gracefully instead of raising an error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to explicitly check for NaT values in the input array and replace them with a suitable representation for integers.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.datetime64) and np.isnat(arr).any():
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
            # Convert NaT values to NaN for integers
            mask = np.isnat(arr)
            result = arr.astype(dtype)
            result[mask] = np.nan
            return result

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # You can paste the original function here

```

With this modification, the function will first check if the input array contains NaT values and if the target dtype is an integer. In that case, it will convert NaT values to NaN before performing the dtype conversion.

This fix should resolve the `ValueError` that was raised in the failing test cases.
