The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is related to the handling of `NaT` values in the input array when converting to an integer dtype. The failing test is trying to convert a `NaT` (Not a Time) value to an integer (`np.int64`), triggering an error that is not being raised as expected.

The buggy function first checks if the input integer dtype is a `datetime64` or `timedelta64` dtype without a specified unit, raising a ValueError if this condition is met. However, it fails to handle the case where a `NaT` value needs to be converted to an integer dtype. This is observed in the failing test where `NaT` values are used, but the error is not raised.

To fix this bug, we need to add a specific check for `NaT` values in the input array when converting to an integer dtype and raise a `ValueError` in such cases. 

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    
    if isna(arr).any():  # Check for NA values in the array
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN or NaT values to integer")

    # The rest of the function remains the same
```

With this update, the function explicitly checks for NA values in the input array before conversion to an integer dtype. If any NA values (including `NaT`) are present, a `ValueError` is raised, ensuring that the function correctly handles the conversion of `NaT` values to an integer dtype. This should make the corrected function pass the failing test.
