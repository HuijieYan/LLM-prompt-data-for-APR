### Issue Analysis
The failing test is trying to convert a `NaT` value to an integer (`int64`), which should raise a `ValueError` according to the function's description. However, the function is currently not handling this scenario correctly, leading to a test failure.

### Error Location
The error seems to be occurring when trying to convert a `NaT` value to an integer `int64`.

### Bug Cause
The issue stems from the `astype_nansafe` function not handling the conversion of `NaT` values to integers correctly for datetime/timedelta types. This results in unexpected behavior when trying to convert `NaT` values to int64.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the dtype to see if it is datetime64 or timedelta64.
2. If the input array contains `NaT` values, raise a `ValueError` as it cannot be converted to an integer.
3. Update the implementation to handle this scenario correctly.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if pd.isna(arr).any():  # Check if any NaT value is present
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ... (existing implementation)

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

By adding the NaT check at the beginning of the function, the correct behavior can be enforced, and the test should pass successfully.
