### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` has a conditional statement to handle when the input dtype is a datetime64 dtype or a timedelta64 dtype.
2. The failing test `test_astype_nansafe` aims to check the behavior of the function when attempting to convert NaN values to integer.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a related problem where converting categorical series back into an integer column converts NaN to an incorrect integer negative value.
   
### Error location:
The bug is likely related to the handling of NaN values in the function when converting to certain dtypes.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because when converting a datetime64 or timedelta64 to a different dtype, the function does not properly handle NaN values.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `astype_nansafe` function to handle NaN values correctly when converting datetime64 or timedelta64 dtypes to int64. We should ensure that NaN values are treated appropriately according to the dtype being converted to.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool=True, skipna: bool=False):
    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Handling conversion from datetime64 to object dtype
        return tslib.ints_to_pydatetime(arr.view(np.int64))

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and is_object_dtype(dtype):
        # Handling conversion from timedelta64 to object dtype
        return tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta(arr.view(np.int64))

    if dtype == np.int64 and isna(arr).any():
        # Check if converting to int64 and input contains NaN values
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # Rest of the function remains as is
    ...
```

By adding specific condition checks for handling conversions to object dtype from datetime64 and timedelta64 and ensuring that NaN values are appropriately handled when converting to int64 dtype, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test.

Feel free to test the corrected function with the provided failing test to ensure it resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.
