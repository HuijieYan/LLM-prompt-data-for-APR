The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function is that it does not handle the case properly when trying to convert `NaT` values to an integer (`np.int64`). The function does not have a specific check for this situation, which leads to the error being raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the input array contains `NaT` values and the desired output type is an integer. In this case, we should raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if is_object_dtype(arr):
        # check if input array contains NaT values and output type is integer
        if (pd.isnull(arr) | pd.isnat(arr)).any() and is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    """
    The rest of the function remains the same
    """
```

With this fix in place, the `astype_nansafe` function will correctly handle the case of `NaT` values being converted to an integer type. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
