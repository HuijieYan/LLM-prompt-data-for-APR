### Bug Analysis:
The failing test cases involve converting NaT values (representing missing values for datetime and timedelta) to an integer data type. The error message indicates that the function should raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer," but the function is not raising the expected error.

Looking at the runtime values and types, we see that when the input parameter `arr` contains NaT values and the `dtype` is np.int64, the function does not properly handle this case and does not raise the expected error.

The GitHub issues related to this bug suggest that there are problems with converting categorical data containing NaNs to integer data types, which aligns with the issue observed in the failing test cases.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the section of the function where it checks if `arr` contains NaT values and the target `dtype` is np.int64, in which case it should raise a ValueError.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the specific case where NaT values are present in the input array and need to be converted to an integer data type. This leads to unexpected behavior and errors in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to implement a condition that properly handles the case when converting NaT values to an integer data type. This condition should check for the presence of NaT values in the array and raise a ValueError with the appropriate message if such values are encountered.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # existing code...

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
        
        if np.isnan(arr).any():  # Check if NaN values are present
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # existing code...
```

By adding the specific condition to check for NaN values in the array before attempting the conversion to an integer data type, the corrected version should now properly handle the case and raise the expected ValueError. This fix aligns with the reported bug and the failing test cases.
