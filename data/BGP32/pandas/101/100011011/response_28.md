### Error Analysis:
The error occurs when trying to convert NaN values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types to an integer value. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` does not handle the conversion of NaT values correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the section where the function checks for datetime64 and timedelta64 types and tries to convert them accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not correctly handling NaN values of datetime64 and timedelta64 types when converting them to integers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to converting datetime64 and timedelta64 types to integers to handle NaN values correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer) and is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype(arr) and isna(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return arr.view(dtype)
```

By adding a check for NaN values in datetime and timedelta arrays when converting to integer types, we can fix the bug and ensure that the conversion process handles NaT values correctly. This change should make the function pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
