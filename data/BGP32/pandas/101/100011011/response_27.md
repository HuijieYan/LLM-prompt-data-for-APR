### Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `astype_nansafe` is called with a `datetime64` or `timedelta64` array containing NaN values and is trying to cast it to an integer type. The bug specifically happens when the function encounters an `np.floating` array and a `np.integer` dtype, leading to the wrong return value and not raising the expected `ValueError`.

### Bug Cause:
The issue arises because the function doesn't handle the case when it tries to convert non-finite values (such as NA or inf) to an integer correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where the `np.floating` array contains non-finite values before attempting to convert it to an integer.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    """
    The rest of the function remains the same
    """
```

By adding this check, the function will now correctly raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert non-finite values to an integer, addressing the bug reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
