**Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
2. The error message indicates that when the input value is NaT (Not a Time) represented by `numpy.datetime64('NaT')` or `numpy.timedelta64('NaT')`, and the desired dtype is `np.int64`, the function fails to raise a `ValueError` with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".
3. The bug is likely due to the lack of specific handling for the case where the input value is NaT and the desired dtype is an integer.

**Bug Cause:**
- The bug occurs when the function encounters NaT values and tries to convert them to an integer dtype directly, which leads to invalid conversion and the subsequent failure to raise an error.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
- The fix involves adding a specific check to handle NaT values and integer conversion appropriately. This check should raise a `ValueError` with the expected message when such a conversion cannot be performed.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    if isna(arr) and is_integer(dtype):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")
  
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding a specific check for NaT values and integer conversion, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle these cases and raise the appropriate error when necessary.
