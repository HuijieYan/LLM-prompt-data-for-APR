1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting elements of an array to a given dtype in a NaN-safe manner. The function handles specific cases for different data types, like strings, datetime64, timedelta64, etc. The failing test is due to the inability of the function to handle converting NaT (Not a Time) values to integer data type.

2. The potential error location is in the block handling the conversion of NaT values to integers within the function. Specifically, the condition where `np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer)` is checked but without considering how to handle converting NaT values to integers.

3. The cause of the bug is the missing handling of NaT values when converting to an integer datatype. The failing test shows that when trying to convert NaT values to np.int64, the function does not raise the expected ValueError, indicating that there is a missing check or exception handling for this specific case.

4. To fix the bug, we need to include a specific check for handling NaT values when converting to an integer datatype. This involves checking for NaT values in the array before attempting the conversion and raising an appropriate exception.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a NaN-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    """

    if isna(arr).any():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NA values to integer")

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

This corrected version of the function now includes a check for NA values in the array before attempting the conversion to an integer datatype. This addition ensures that the function handles NaN values properly during the conversion process, fixing the bug indicated by the failing test.
