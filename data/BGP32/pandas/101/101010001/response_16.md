### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is responsible for casting elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.
2. The failing test indicates an issue when trying to convert NaT values to integer.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the condition that checks if NaN values need to be skipped when casting as a string-type (`skipna` parameter).
4. The bug is triggered when attempting to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to an integer dtype which results in a `ValueError` as shown in the failing test.
5. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where NaT values are being converted to an integer dtype more appropriately.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the code block responsible for converting NaT values to an integer dtype. In the buggy function, this block can be found under the condition `elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):`. We will add a check to handle the case where NaT values are present in the array.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # The existing code
    
    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

        mask_missing = pd.isna(arr)
        if mask_missing.any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the `mask_missing` check, we ensure that if there are any missing values (NaT in this case), a `ValueError` will be raised. This modification addresses the issue of not being able to convert NaT values to an integer dtype and fixes the bug.
