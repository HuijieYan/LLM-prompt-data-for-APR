### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `astype_nansafe` function did not raise a `ValueError` as expected when trying to cast a NaT value (Not a Time) to an integer. This issue arises when the input is of type `datetime64` or `timedelta64` representing 'NaT' (Not a Time).

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the part of the code where it tries to perform the conversion from `datetime64` or `timedelta64` types to another type, specifically `np.int64`. An if condition is missing to handle the case where the input value is 'NaT'.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case when 'NaT' is being converted to an integer type (`np.int64`), leading to the unexpected behavior and failure of the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the input value is 'NaT' when converting from `datetime64` or `timedelta64` to an integer. If the input value is 'NaT', raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message to inform the caller that 'NaT' values cannot be converted to an integer.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Or when trying to convert 'NaT' to an integer type.

    TypeError
        When failed to perform the conversion.
    """

    # other parts of the function remain the same

    elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

        if isna(arr):
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # other parts of the function remain the same
```

### Correction Made:
In the corrected version, an additional condition is added to check if the input array contains 'NaT' values before performing the conversion to an integer type. If 'NaT' values are detected, a `ValueError` is raised to handle this specific case and alert the caller about the issue. This fix addresses the buggy behavior in the original implementation.
