### Analysis:
The buggy function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. The test case provided fails to raise a `ValueError` when it is expected to do so. The error message suggests that the conversion of `NaT` values to integers is the issue.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be located in the following block of code:
```python
elif np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):

    if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
```

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code is checking if all values in the floating array are finite before converting them to integers. Within the test case, the value `NaT` (Not-a-Time) is being considered, which leads to the failure to raise a `ValueError` due to the unexpected datatype `NaT`.

### Solution:
To fix this issue, we should check the type of values in the array before attempting to convert them. To address the specific test case provided, we need to handle the case where `NaT` values are present. Since `NaT` values are not finite, they should be checked for explicitly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer.
    """

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):

        if not np.isfinite(arr).all() and not np.isnan(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By explicitly checking for `NaN` values in addition to non-finite values, the corrected function should now handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers correctly. This change should make the function pass the failing test case.
