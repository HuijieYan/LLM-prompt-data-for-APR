Based on the analysis of the buggy function `astype_nansafe`, the issue arises when trying to convert NaT (Not-a-Time) values to an integer (`np.int64`). The function is not handling this specific case correctly, leading to a ValueError being raised during the test.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case where the input array contains NaT values and needs to be converted to an integer dtype. The current implementation does not handle this scenario appropriately, leading to the failure in the provided test.

To fix this bug, we need to include a specific check for NaT values and handling for conversion to an integer dtype in the `astype_nansafe` function.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy=True, skipna=False):
    if isna(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged

    # dispatch on extension dtype if needed
    if is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        return dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(arr, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)

    if not isinstance(dtype, np.dtype):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)

    if issubclass(dtype.type, str):
        return lib.astype_str(arr.ravel(), skipna=skipna).reshape(arr.shape)

    # The remaining code follows the original implementation

```

By including the check for NaT values and preventing their conversion to integer, the corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
