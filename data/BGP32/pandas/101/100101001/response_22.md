The buggy function `astype_nansafe` encounters an issue when trying to convert NaT (Not a Time) values to integer values. The function raises a `ValueError` stating "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" when it encounters these special values. However, the implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to update the implementation to properly handle the case where the input array contains NaT values. We should add a check for NaT values in the array before performing any conversions. If NaT values are present, we should handle them appropriately based on the desired behavior for the specific dtype.

Here is the corrected version of the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    if np.any(pd.isna(arr)):  # Check if input array contains NaN or NaT values
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):  # Check if the target type is integer
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN or NaT values to integer")
        # Handle other dtype conversions for NaN values based on the specific behavior required
    
    # The rest of the function implementation as before
    ...
```

This updated version of the function explicitly checks for NaN or NaT values in the input array and raises a `ValueError` if the target dtype is integer. For other dtypes, you can define the behavior for handling NaN or NaT values according to the specific requirements. This modification should resolve the failing tests related to converting NaT values to integer values.
