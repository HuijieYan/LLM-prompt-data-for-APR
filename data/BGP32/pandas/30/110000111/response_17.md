### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to convert data into a date column, handling different types of input formats. The function checks if the data is empty, converts the data to `int64` if it's in object format, ignores numbers out of range, and then tries to convert the data into a datetime format.

The bug seems to be causing issues with boolean data input, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors.

### Error Location
The error might be occurring in the handling of boolean data types in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. It seems that the function is attempting to convert boolean data as if they were numerical data, leading to the incorrect conversion problem described in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the function to treat boolean values as numerical data and attempt to convert them to datetime, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors. This leads to the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description where a Series of boolean values is expected but it results in datetime values or exceptions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to specifically handle boolean data separately from numeric data and ensure that boolean values are not processed as if they were timestamps. We should update the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly handle boolean data, keeping the expected behavior in mind.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version explicitly handles boolean data by returning the data unchanged if it is of boolean type, ensuring that such data is not processed incorrectly as timestamps. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue described in the GitHub problem.
