### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for converting data into date format, primarily handling cases like coercion of object into epoch/iso formats and integers/floats into epoch formats.
2. The function takes in `data`, which is expected to be a pandas object (RangeIndex or Series), and operates on it based on its dtype.
3. The issue reported on GitHub involves incorrect conversion of boolean values to timestamps, leading to an exception. This happens for the Series of booleans when using `typ="series"` in `pd.read_json`.
4. The function fails to handle boolean values correctly and ends up trying to convert them to datetime types, resulting in an error.

### Bug Explanation
1. For boolean data, the function checks if the dtype is 'object' and then tries to convert it to 'int64'. However, this conversion is unnecessary and incorrect for boolean values.
2. In the case of boolean data, the function should skip the conversion step to 'int64' and directly deal with boolean values in a separate condition.
3. Due to this incorrect conversion, the function ends up processing boolean values as if they are integers that represent timestamps, leading to the exception raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add a condition to check if the dtype of the data is boolean, and if so, handle it separately without converting it to 'int64'.
2. Skip unnecessary conversions for boolean data and ensure that boolean values are not treated as potential timestamp representations during conversion.
3. Correctly maintain the data type of boolean values throughout the function.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object" and not all(new_data.values):
        # skip unnecessary conversion for boolean values
        pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
``` 

In this corrected version, we have included a conditional check for boolean data and avoided unnecessary conversions, ensuring that boolean values are handled appropriately and not mistakenly converted to datetime types. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to boolean values being incorrectly processed when using `typ="series"`.
