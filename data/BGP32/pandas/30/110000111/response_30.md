### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column by handling different cases like object, integer, float, and date formats. However, the current implementation has an issue where it tries to convert boolean data into datetime, causing unexpected behavior as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Error location
The main issue lies in the logic flow where boolean data is not appropriately handled, resulting in the conversion attempt to datetime format.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not handle boolean data properly for conversion to datetime. It tries to convert boolean values to date, resulting in an error and unexpected behavior as described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to add a specific handling for boolean data to prevent the unnecessary conversion attempt to datetime format.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected version includes specific handling for boolean data where it directly returns the data without attempting to convert it to datetime. It ensures that the function behaves as expected and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
