## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to convert a numpy array-like data into a date column by parsing it. The function checks the data type and attempts to convert it into `int64` if it is an object type. It then verifies if the values are within a certain range before trying to convert them into datetime objects using the `to_datetime` function.

The bug seems to be in the logic where the function checks if the data values are in range before converting them to datetime. The comparison operations are incorrect which leads to the data being returned as-is without proper conversion.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the comparison operations in the condition `not in_range.all()` are incorrectly checking if the values are outside the range, which results in not converting the data to datetime even when it should be within the valid range. This causes the test to fail as the data is not converted as expected.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the comparison conditions for checking if the values are within range need to be corrected. The conditions should be adjusted to properly account for values within the range to trigger the conversion to datetime.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data <= self.max_stamp)  # corrected condition for in range
            | (new_data < self.min_stamp)   # corrected condition for in range
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.any():  # corrected condition
            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True
        return data, False
    return data, False
``` 

After applying the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function, the bug should be fixed, and the test should pass successfully.
