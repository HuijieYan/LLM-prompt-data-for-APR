## Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data to a date column. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that are causing it to fail the test case provided. Here are the identified potential errors:
1. The function is not correctly converting object type data to integer type.
2. The logic for checking if numbers are out of range is flawed.
3. The loop for trying different date units is not implemented correctly.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the first case, when the data is a `RangeIndex`, the function incorrectly tries to convert the data to `int64` using `astype` resulting in retaining the original `RangeIndex` data type.
2. The function doesn't check for numbers that are out of range properly. The logic to check if numbers are out of range is incorrect, leading to incorrect return values.
3. The loop that tries different date units doesn't work as intended since it returns `new_data` after the first iteration without trying all date units.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly convert object type data to integer type before proceeding.
2. Correct the logic for checking if numbers are out of range.
3. Modify the loop to iterate over all date units and return the converted data only after trying all date units.

## Corrected Function
```python
class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data.copy()
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        for date_unit in (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else reversed(self._STAMP_UNITS):
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        
        return new_data, True
```

With these changes, the `_try_convert_to_date` function should now correctly handle the conversion and return the expected results for the given test.
