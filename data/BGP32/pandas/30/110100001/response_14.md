## Analysis:
- The `_try_convert_to_date` function is attempting to convert a numpy ndarray to a date column by checking the dtype of the data and then processing it accordingly.
- The bug seems to be in the logic related to checking for numbers that are out of range and handling them.
- The failing test involves reading a JSON array containing boolean values into a pandas Series and comparing it with an expected Series.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the handling of numbers that are out of range.
- The current implementation is not correctly identifying numbers that are out of range and potentially skipping the conversion step for valid data.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to ensure that the logic for checking numbers out of range is correct and does not skip valid data during conversion.
- Make sure to handle different data types appropriately to avoid errors during the conversion process.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='ignore')
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data <= pd.Timestamp.max.value)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

By updating the logic for handling numbers that are out of range and making sure to convert different data types correctly, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test.
