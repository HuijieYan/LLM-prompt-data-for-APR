## Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to convert data into a date column by parsing it based on certain conditions. However, there are issues with the logic in the function that prevent it from working correctly. The function attempts to convert an object type to `int64`, ignores numbers out of range, and then tries to convert the data to datetime using different date units. There are several areas where errors may be occurring:

1. The conversion of object dtype to `int64` might not produce the desired outcome.
2. Handling of out-of-range numbers may not be accurate.
3. The loop over date units might not be behaving as expected.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test, the input data is `[true, true, false]` with a dtype of bool. The buggy function fails to handle this input properly when attempting to convert object dtype to `int64` because bool type cannot be directly converted to int. This results in the original data being returned instead of being converted to a datetime Series as intended.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the conversion of data with bool dtype. We should bypass the conversion to `int64` if the data is not of a compatible type. Also, we need to ensure that the code properly loops over the date units to attempt to convert the data to datetime based on different units.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """    
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()

    # Handle object dtype
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    
    # Handle numbers out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = new_data.apply(lambda x: isna(x) or x > self.min_stamp or x == iNaT)
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = [self.date_unit] if self.date_unit else list(self._STAMP_UNITS)
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    
    return data, False
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now be able to handle boolean data and attempt to convert it to date format as expected.
