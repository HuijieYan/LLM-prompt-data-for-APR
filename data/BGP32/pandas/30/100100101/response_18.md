## Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert input data to date format. The issue is with the datatype check and conversion operations on the input data. 

### Identified Bugs
1. The function mistakenly assumes that converting the input data to 'int64' will handle all cases of conversion to date, which is incorrect.
2. The check for numbers out of range is not correct, and the handling of these cases is causing incorrect returns.
3. The loop over date units does not handle the conversions properly or cycle through all possibilities.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes incorrect behavior in handling the input data and results in returning the wrong data or flag (True/False) for successful conversion. The incorrect data type assumptions and checks lead to issues in conversion.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure a comprehensive check for various date formats and handle each case correctly.
2. Implement proper error handling for conversions that may fail.
3. Fix the behavior of checking numbers out of range and adjust the return values accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    # Attempt to convert to datetime format
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        pass

    return data, False
```

This corrected version simplifies the conversion process by directly attempting to convert the input data to datetime format. If there are any errors during conversion, it catches exceptions and returns the original data with a False flag to indicate unsuccessful conversion. This approach ensures better handling of various date formats and avoids unnecessary checks and conversions.
