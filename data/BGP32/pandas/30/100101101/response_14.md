The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in the logic that checks the range of numbers before converting them to datetime. The condition `if not in_range.all():` inappropriately returns the original data without trying to convert it again.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to ensure that if any number is out of range, we skip the conversion for that number and proceed with converting the rest. This can be achieved by iterating over the data and converting each value individually.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    success = False
    for i, value in enumerate(new_data):
        if issubclass(value.__class__, (int, float)) and not isna(value):
            if value <= self.min_stamp:
                continue
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_value = pd.to_datetime(value, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                new_data[i] = new_value
                success = True
                break
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    return new_data, success
```

With these changes, the function will iterate over each value in the data, check if it's within range, and attempt to convert it to a datetime value. If conversion is successful for any value, it will replace the original value in the data with the converted value, allowing the function to handle mixed types and exceptions more gracefully.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
