### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to convert a given array-like input into a date column by parsing it in different date formats. The function first checks the type of the input data and tries to convert it accordingly. There are issues related to handling bool data types when attempting to convert them to datetime objects. This leads to inconsistent behavior and type errors, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Identified errors:
1. The function does not handle bool data types correctly and tries to convert them to int64 mistakenly.
2. When processing bool data, the function should return the original data without attempting date conversion.
3. The function does not differentiate between the date conversion process for different data types.

### Bug cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of bool data types in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. When encountering bool data, it wrongly tries to convert it to int64, leading to errors. This results in inconsistent behavior and errors, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Add a conditional check to handle bool data types separately and return the original data without attempting date conversion.
2. Ensure the function appropriately handles different data types during the conversion process.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    elif data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False
    else:
        new_data = data

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function handles bool data types separately, returns the original data without attempting date conversion for bool values, and ensures proper handling of different data types during the conversion process. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
