### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column in specific date units. The function checks if the dtype of the data is "object", tries to convert it to "int64", then checks if the numbers are in range, and finally attempts to convert the data to datetime in specified units. However, the function fails to handle boolean values properly, leading to incorrect behavior when dealing with boolean data.

### Error location
The error in the function occurs when dealing with boolean values. The function doesn't handle boolean data appropriately, causing it to convert boolean values incorrectly and leading to unexpected results, such as converting booleans into timestamps.

### Cause of the bug
When the input data contains boolean values, the function does not have a specific case to handle them. This causes the function to proceed with the default behavior, trying to convert them into integers and eventually to datetimes. This results in the incorrect conversion of boolean values to timestamps, causing the tests to fail.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, a specific handling case for boolean data should be added to the function. Boolean values should be directly converted to boolean types in the output without going through the conversion steps designed for numerical data.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data

    # handle boolean data directly
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, False

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS

    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version addresses the handling of boolean data explicitly, ensuring that boolean values are properly returned as boolean types without any unwanted conversions. This modification should resolve the issue and make the function work as expected in the provided failing test scenario.
