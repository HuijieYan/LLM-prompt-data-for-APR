### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data to date format, but it contains a bug where it coerces boolean values to integer (int64) values leading to unexpected behavior for bool data. This bug causes the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` to result in timestamps instead of a Series of boolean values, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the part where it attempts to coerce object data to int64, which is unnecessary and leads to the incorrect conversion of boolean values.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the attempt to convert boolean values to int64 unnecessarily, which results in incorrect data conversion when dealing with boolean data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Avoid converting boolean values to int64 unnecessarily.
2. Handle boolean value conversion separately to ensure that boolean values remain as they are in the output.

### Correction of the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":  # Handling boolean data separately
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version handles boolean values separately, ensuring that they do not go through unnecessary conversion steps. This fix should address the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
