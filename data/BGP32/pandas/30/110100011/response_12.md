## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for trying to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column. The issue arises when trying to coerce boolean values into date formats, which leads to unexpected behavior as seen in the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` from the GitHub issue.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The conversion of boolean data to date format as `int64` in the if condition block.
2. Handling of boolean values in the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is trying to convert boolean values to `int64` first, which leads to incorrect results when trying to convert them to date formats later. This results in the unexpected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue, causing boolean values to be misinterpreted as date values.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should exclude boolean values from the conversion attempts to `int64` and focus on parsing them correctly as boolean values or handling them separately during date conversion.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            if data.dtype == bool:
                # Handle boolean values separately
                return data, False
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By excluding boolean values from the conversion to `int64` and handling them separately, the corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test provided in the GitHub issue.
