The bug in the provided function lies in the logic of checking and converting data types. The function is intended to convert data to date format based on certain conditions but it fails to handle the conversion correctly.

The bug arises because the function is incorrectly checking the data type for conversion and storing the converted data back in the original variable `new_data` without considering the consequences of the conversion on subsequent checks and operations.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the data type conversion is handled properly and the converted data is not stored back in the original variable. Instead, we should create a new variable to store the converted data while preserving the original data for further processing.

Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # Create a copy to store converted data
    if new_data.dtype == np.dtype('O'):
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            converted_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return converted_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected version ensures that the original data is preserved and a copy is used for conversion and subsequent operations. This should align with the expected input/output values provided for the function and handle the conversion of data to date format appropriately.
