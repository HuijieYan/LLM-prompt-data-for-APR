The bug in the provided function is that it is not properly checking and converting the data to datetime. The function is only checking for numbers that are out of range but not converting the data to datetime format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is correctly converted to datetime format as specified. We also need to handle the case where the data dtype is an object and convert it to int64 before attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version ensures that the data is properly converted to datetime format after checking for any potential conversion needed. It also handles the conversion of object dtype to int64 before converting it to datetime. This should now satisfy the expected input/output values for the function.
