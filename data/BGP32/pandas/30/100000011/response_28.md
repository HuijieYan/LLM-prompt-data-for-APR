## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to convert a given data array into a date column based on certain conditions. However, the function fails to handle the conversion properly as identified in the GitHub issue related to `read_json` with `typ="series"`. The issue states that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of boolean values, but it instead results in a series of timestamps or raises a TypeError in newer versions of Pandas.

## Identified Error Locations:
1. The function incorrectly attempts to convert boolean values to date values, leading to the unexpected output.
2. The handling of the `new_data` array and the conditions for conversion are not aligned with the expected behavior explained in the GitHub issue.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the attempt to coerce boolean values to timestamps or dates within the `_try_convert_to_date` function, contrary to the expected output of a Pandas Series of boolean values.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to adjust the function to handle boolean values correctly and ensure that the conversion is aligned with the expected behavior as described in the GitHub issue. Specifically, we should check for boolean data types and handle them accordingly to output a Pandas Series of boolean values.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            return data, False
    elif issubdtype(data.dtype, np.bool_):
        return data, False

    return data, True
```

In the corrected version of the function, we handle the case of boolean values separately and return the original data with a flag indicating the conversion result. This change ensures that boolean values are not coerced into date values, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.
