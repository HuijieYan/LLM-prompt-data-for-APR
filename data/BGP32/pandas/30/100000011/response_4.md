### Analysis:
The function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception." The issue arises when trying to read a Series of bool values from a JSON list, but instead, receiving a Series of timestamps or an exception.

### Identified Error Location:
The main potential error locations in the `_try_convert_to_date` function are:
1. Incorrect conversion of bool values to dates.
2. Incorrect handling of data types and conversions.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to the function `_try_convert_to_date` attempting to convert bool values into datetime objects, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to parse bool values from a JSON list.

### Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles bool values and does not attempt to convert them to dates.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

        if not np.issubdtype(data.dtype, np.number) and not np.issubdtype(data.dtype, np.datetime64):
            return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

By making the modifications above, the function will correctly handle bool values and not attempt unnecessary conversions. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to reading a Series of bool values from a JSON list.
