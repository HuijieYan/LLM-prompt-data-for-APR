### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is related to the GitHub issue "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception". The issue describes a problem where `pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")` results in a Pandas Series of timestamps or an exception instead of a Series of bools as expected.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function is attempting to convert boolean values to timestamps which causes the issue.
2. The function checks for empty data but doesn't handle boolean values appropriately.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function trying to convert boolean values to timestamps in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. This leads to unexpected behavior when dealing with boolean data while parsing it.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_try_convert_to_date` needs to be modified to check for boolean values and handle them correctly. It should return a proper Pandas Series of boolean values instead of attempting to convert them to timestamps.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == bool:
        data_as_bools = Series(new_data)
        return data_as_bools, True

    return data, False
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now checks for boolean values and returns a Pandas Series of boolean values directly without attempting to convert them to timestamps. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to unexpected behavior when parsing boolean values as a Series.
