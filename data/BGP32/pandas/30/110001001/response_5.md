## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function occurs due to the incorrect conversion of the input `data` into date format. The function attempts to convert the `data` array into a date format by checking if the dtype of the array is 'object' and then coercing it to 'int64'. However, in the provided buggy function, the conversion to 'int64' is not preserving the original data but is rather converting it to a RangeIndex. This leads to the subsequent comparisons and checks not working as intended.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, the function needs to ensure that the original data is preserved during the conversion process. One way to achieve this is by creating a copy of the original data before attempting any type conversion. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # Make a copy of the original data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the original `data` is preserved by making a copy before any conversion operations. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to properly convert the input data into date format.
