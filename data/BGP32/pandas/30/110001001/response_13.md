The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it always returns the original `data` without converting it to a date, even when conversion is successful. This is due to the early return statement inside the loop that checks different date units. 

### Cause of the bug:
1. The function `to_datetime` is called inside a loop that iterates through different date units, but the loop returns immediately after the first successful conversion. This means that if the first date unit conversion is successful, the function will return that result and not attempt conversions with other units.
2. The check for successful conversion `return new_data, True` is within the loop, so it stops the loop execution almost immediately.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function tries all the date units and only returns `False` if none of the conversion attempts were successful. One way to achieve this is to track whether any conversion was successful within the loop, and only return `False` after checking all date units.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    converted = False
    
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
            converted = True
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            converted = True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    
    if converted:
        return new_data, True
    else:
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that it tries to convert the input data with all available date units and returns `True` only if at least one conversion was successful.
