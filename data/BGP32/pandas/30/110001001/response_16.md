The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in the handling of the date conversion process. It fails to correctly check the condition for numbers that are out of range, causing the function to return incorrect results.

The strategy to fix this bug is to properly handle the out of range numbers check and ensure that the date conversion process is correct.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data >= self.min_stamp)  # changed > to >=
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True  # moved this line inside the try block
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, I fixed the comparison in the `in_range` calculation to include numbers equal to `self.min_stamp`, which was missing in the original implementation. I also moved the return statement inside the try block to ensure that correct output is returned after a successful date conversion.
