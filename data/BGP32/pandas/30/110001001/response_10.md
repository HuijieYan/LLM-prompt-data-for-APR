The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is that the date conversion is not actually being attempted correctly due to a logic issue in the loop that handles conversion attempts with different date units.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The function checks if the data type is "object" and tries to convert it to "int64" which is correct.
2. It then checks if the data, when converted to integers, falls within a certain range defined by `min_stamp`. If not, it returns the original `data`, which is correct.
3. The bug lies in the loop that iterates over date units. The loop immediately returns the new_data if any exceptions are raised during the conversion attempt using the first date unit. This prevents the function from trying other date units in case of failure.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the loop to attempt conversion with different date units and only return `new_data` when the conversion is successful. If none of the date unit conversions succeed, we can return the original `data`.

### Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True  # Move this line inside the try block to return only when successful
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue  # continue to next date unit if conversion fails
    return data, False  # Return original data if no date unit conversion succeeds
```

By moving the return statement inside the try block and adding `continue` to handle exceptions, the function will correctly try multiple date units for conversion before returning the original data if all attempts fail.
