### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to convert data to date format, handling various formats and scenarios. However, in the provided code and based on the runtime and expected values, there seems to be an issue with how the conversion and date handling is being performed. The issue seems to relate to wrongly converting boolean data to datetime objects.

### Bug Identification:
1. The buggy function wrongly converts boolean data, leading to incorrect datetime representations.
2. In the first case, the input data is a boolean Series but the function tries to convert it to datetime format leading to incorrect results.
3. The exception raised in the GitHub issue aligns with this bug where bool values are incorrectly converted to datetime.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the function trying to parse boolean data into datetime format, which is incorrect and leads to unexpected behaviors and exceptions.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function only operates date-related conversions on appropriate data types and correctly handle boolean data.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if not issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.bool_):  # Check if data is boolean
        return data, False

    return data, True
```

This corrected version now properly handles boolean data and avoids unnecessary conversion attempts to datetime format. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure correct behavior in the described scenarios.
