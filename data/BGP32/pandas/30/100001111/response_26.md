### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into a date column, handling different data types and formats. However, there are issues with the current implementation, leading to incorrect behavior observed in the failing test cases and the reported GitHub issue.

### Error Locations:
1. The conversion of boolean data seems incorrect.
2. Handling of timestamps and exceptions might be causing unexpected behavior.
3. Inconsistencies in the conversion logic for different data types.

### Cause of the Bug:
Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue:
1. The function is converting boolean data into timestamps instead of preserving them as booleans.
2. The function is not correctly identifying boolean values resulting in a TypeError during conversion.
3. The function does not handle different data types consistently, leading to unexpected outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly handle boolean data without converting it to timestamps.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the data types before attempting conversion.
3. Revise the conversion logic to handle different data types consistently.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.
    Return a boolean indicating if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == 'object':
        try:
            new_data = data.astype('int64')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, False

    if issubclass(data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(data._values)
            | (data > self.min_stamp)
            | (data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            data = to_datetime(data, errors='raise', unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return data, True

    return data, False
```

With these changes, the function should now handle boolean data correctly, prevent unnecessary timestamp conversion, and provide consistent behavior across different data types.

By applying the corrected function, the failing test cases and issues reported on GitHub should be resolved effectively.
