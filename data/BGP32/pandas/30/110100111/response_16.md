### Analysis
- The `Parser` class contains a method `_try_convert_to_date` that attempts to convert a given ndarray-like data into a date column.
- The function checks if the data is empty and then tries to convert the data to `int64` if it's of type 'object'.
- It proceeds to check if the data is within a specified range for numbers.
- It then goes through different date units and tries to convert the data to datetime using the specified unit.

### Error Location
1. The conversion to `int64` for 'object' type data may not be necessary if the data is already in a suitable format.
2. Checking if the data is within a range might not be necessary based on the input data structure.
3. The loop over multiple date units might not be required.

### Cause of the Bug
- The bug leads to unexpected behavior when trying to parse a boolean series as dates, resulting in an exception instead of a series of boolean values.
- The function includes unnecessary checks and conversions that lead to the incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the data type of the input data and directly return if it's a boolean series to prevent unnecessary conversions.
2. Eliminate unnecessary checks for numeric range and iterating over multiple date units.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.
    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # Check if the data is a boolean Series and return directly
    if data.dtype == 'bool':
        return data, True
    
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit)
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In this corrected version, unnecessary conversions and checks are removed, and the function now directly returns the data if it's a boolean series.

This should fix the bug related to parsing boolean values as dates and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
