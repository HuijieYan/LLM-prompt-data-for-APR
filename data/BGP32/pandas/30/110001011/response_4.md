### Analysis:
1. The function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to parse an ndarray into a date column.
2. The function attempts to convert object types to `int64` and handle numbers within a certain range.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of timestamp conversion, leading to unexpected results.
   
### Error Locations:
1. The conversion of data to `int64` inside the `try` block might not cover all cases properly.
2. Handling of numbers out of range within the `if` condition based on dtype might be incorrect.
3. The loop over date units might not handle exceptions properly, leading to the wrong return.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of timestamp conversions within the function. The incorrect handling of object type conversions and exception catch blocks leads to unexpected results, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper conversion of object types to timestamps.
2. Correctly handle numbers out of range.
3. Handle exceptions during the conversion loop accurately.
4. Make sure the function returns the correct date conversion results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors="coerce")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        return data, False
```

This corrected version should handle the timestamp conversions correctly and address the reported issue on GitHub.
