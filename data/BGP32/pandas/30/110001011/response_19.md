### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to convert the input data into a date column by checking various conditions and converting the data as needed. However, the bug causes unexpected behavior and incorrect output, leading to issues such as raising exceptions instead of returning the expected Series of bools.

### Identified Error:
The bug is within the logic of handling the input data and attempting to convert it to a date column. The condition for checking if the data type is an object and then converting it to `int64` is incorrect. Additionally, the handling of data being out of range is problematic and leads to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the function to wrongly process the input data, leading to incorrect conversions and unexpected behavior. This is evident from the failed test case where the function should return the original data along with a `False` boolean value, indicating unsuccessful conversion. However, due to bugs in the logic, the function returns the original data without proper conversion and success status.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition for checking if the data type is an object and requires conversion to `int64`.
2. Address the handling of data being out of range to ensure correct processing and conversion.
3. Ensure that the function returns the correct output indicating the success or failure of the conversion.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='ignore')
            except ValueError:
                pass
    
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

### Changes Made:
1. Replaced the data type conversion logic to `pd.to_numeric` instead of directly converting to `int64`.
2. Updated the condition for handling data that is out of range.
3. Ensured that the function correctly returns the converted data along with a boolean indicating success or failure.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now handle the input data appropriately and return the expected output, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
