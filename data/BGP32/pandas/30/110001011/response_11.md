### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to coerce input data into a date column by converting it to int64 and then to datetime. It checks for certain conditions like the data type being object and if the values are within a certain range.
2. The GitHub issue indicates that a specific case is failing when trying to read JSON data as a Series of bool values, but the function is incorrectly converting it to timestamps resulting in a TypeError.
3. The bug seems to be related to incorrect type conversion and handling when processing the input data.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles the input data as bool values when provided as a Series, instead of trying to convert them to timestamps.

### Bug Fix
We need to add a specific condition to handle bool data in the input and return it as is without attempting to convert it to datetime. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        # Specifically for bool data, return as is
        return data, True

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This fix includes a check for boolean data type and directly returns the data if it's boolean, preventing unnecessary conversion attempts. This should address the specific issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
