### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is responsible for converting a numpy ndarray-like object into a date column. The function attempts to convert the data to `int64` if it is of type "object" and then checks if the date values are within a specified range before attempting to convert them to datetime. The issue on GitHub is related to a specific case where the function fails to handle boolean values correctly.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided case, the function receives a `RangeIndex` type object `data` and tries to convert it to `int64`. While the conversion happens successfully, the subsequent check for values being in range fails because the `new_data` contains integer values instead of datetime values. This discrepancy leads to returning the original `data` unchanged with a `False` flag.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the input data does not represent datetime values correctly. We can create checks to differentiate between date and non-date data types and adjust the conversion process accordingly. By ensuring that the function correctly handles boolean and non-date values, we can address the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.
    
    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            data = data.astype(int)
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        else:
            in_range = (
                isna(data._values)
                | (data > self.min_stamp)
                | (data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if in_range.all():
                return to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=self.date_unit), True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version applies the date conversion procedure only if the input data is successfully converted to `int`. Additionally, it ensures the values are within the specified range before attempting to convert them to datetime format. By incorporating these adjustments, we should have a function that handles the conversion of non-date values correctly, fixing the reported issue.
