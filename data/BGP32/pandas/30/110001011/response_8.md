### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to parse an ndarray into a date column by coercing object types into int64 and then checking if the values are within a certain range. It then tries to convert the data into datetime format using various date units.
2. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return the original `data` instead of the converted `new_data` under certain conditions, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. The GitHub issue relates to `read_json` with `typ="series"` resulting in exceptions instead of expected behavior. This bug may be causing the unexpected behavior in `read_json` as well.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct conversions are taking place and that the date units are being handled appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the conversion logic from object to int64 to ensure it covers all cases properly.
2. Verify the range check for numbers is correctly excluding out-of-range values.
3. Ensure the `to_datetime` function is being called with the correct date units.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return new_data, False
```

By making these adjustments in the function, it should now correctly handle the conversion of data into date columns and avoid the issues reported in the GitHub thread related to `read_json`.
