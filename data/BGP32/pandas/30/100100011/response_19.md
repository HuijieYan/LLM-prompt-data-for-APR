## Analysis:
1. The `read_json` call with `typ="series"` in the failing test is expected to create a Pandas Series of bools but instead results in timestamps/values that are not of the correct type.
2. The issue on GitHub points out that the expected output should be a Series of bools. In older versions, it resulted in timestamps and in newer versions, it raises a TypeError.
3. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` tries to convert data to datetime, which results in the incorrect output.
4. The bug occurs due to the function's attempt to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not the intended behavior.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves updating the function to directly handle boolean values without converting them to datetime.

## The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data

    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.copy()  # Ensure we don't modify the original data
                bool_vals = isna(new_data) | (new_data == 'true') | (new_data == 'false')
                new_data[~bool_vals] = np.datetime64('nat')  # Clear non-boolean values
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

    return new_data, True
```

By directly checking for boolean values in the object-type columns and setting non-boolean values to `np.datetime64('nat')`, we can ensure that the output is corrected.
