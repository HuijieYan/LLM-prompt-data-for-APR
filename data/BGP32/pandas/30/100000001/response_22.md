## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to parse an ndarray-like data into a date column. It attempts to convert the data into datetime format and return a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful. However, there are potential error locations within the function that may lead to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function mistakenly uses the original `data` instead of the modified `new_data` in some parts, which could lead to inconsistency in handling the conversion.
2. The condition `if not in_range.all():` checks if any value is out of range but should potentially return `data, False` instead of `data, False`.
3. The loop over `date_units` may not handle all possible date units correctly due to an early return statement inside the loop.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function may return incorrect results due to operations performed on the original `data` instead of the modified `new_data`. Additionally, the handling of out-of-range values and the loop over date units may not function as intended.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the modified `new_data` consistently throughout the function to ensure that all operations are performed on the converted data.
2. Properly handle out-of-range values by returning `data, False` when any value is out of range instead of just `data, False`.
3. Ensure that the loop over date units processes all units correctly and doesn't terminate prematurely.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
	"""
	Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

	Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
	formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
	"""
	# no conversion on empty
	if not len(data):
	    return data, False

	new_data = data
	if new_data.dtype == "object":
	    try:
	        new_data = data.astype("int64")
	    except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
	        pass

	# ignore numbers that are out of range
	if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
	    in_range = (
	        isna(new_data._values)
	        | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
	        | (new_data._values == iNaT)
	    )
	    if not in_range.all():
	        return new_data, False

	date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
	successful_conversion = False
	for date_unit in date_units:
	    try:
	        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
	        successful_conversion = True
	    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
	        continue
	    
	if successful_conversion:
	    return new_data, True
	else:
	    return data, False
``` 

In the corrected version, the function uses `new_data` consistently, properly handles out-of-range values, and ensures that all date units are processed before returning the final result.
