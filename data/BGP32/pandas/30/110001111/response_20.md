### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_try_convert_to_date` function when trying to parse a Series of boolean values. The function incorrectly treats the boolean Series as if it were a potential date type, resulting in unexpected behavior. This bug is related to the issue reported on GitHub, where it was expected to get a Series of boolean values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values correctly. We should not attempt to convert boolean values into date types. Instead, we need to ensure that if the input data is a boolean Series, the function returns it as is, without trying to convert it to a date.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/io/json/_json.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, False
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

By adding a condition to return the boolean Series as is without any conversion in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, we ensure that the correct behavior is maintained for boolean inputs as desired in the GitHub issue.
