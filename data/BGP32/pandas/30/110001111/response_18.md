### Analysis:
1. The function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to convert data to a date column by parsing it based on certain conditions. 
2. The function checks the data type of the input `data`, tries to convert it to `int64`, then checks if the data is within a certain range, and finally attempts to convert it to a datetime object.
3. The bug is causing issues when dealing with boolean data, resulting in an incorrect conversion to datetime.
4. The GitHub issue provides a clear example where using `typ="series"` with a JSON list of bools results in a TypeError. This aligns with the observed issue in the function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug happens when dealing with boolean data. The function does not handle boolean data appropriately and attempts to convert it to datetime objects, leading to TypeErrors. This is evident from the provided runtime and expected values, where the input data is of type bool, but the function incorrectly processes it as if it was supposed to be converted to datetime.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the data type of the input `data` before attempting conversion.
2. If the data type is boolean, handle it differently to avoid type conversion errors.
3. Ensure that boolean data remains as booleans and does not get processed as datetime objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        # handle boolean data separately
        if new_data.dtype == bool:
            return new_data, False
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

By adding a specific handling for boolean data and ensuring it is not converted to datetime objects, the bug should be fixed based on the provided information.
