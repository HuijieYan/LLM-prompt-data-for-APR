### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into date format based on certain conditions.
2. The function iterates through various date units and tries to convert the data using `to_datetime`.
3. The issue mentioned in the GitHub problem is related to converting boolean values to date format resulting in an exception since Pandas version 1.0.0.
4. The incorrect behavior observed is due to the function trying to convert boolean values to date formats.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the block where conversion to date format takes place for boolean values. This is evident from the GitHub issue related to boolean values being converted to timestamps. The function does not handle boolean values appropriately.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case where the input `data` is a boolean Series, the function encounters an issue when trying to convert these boolean values to date formats. This results in an exception due to the mismatch between boolean and date formats. The function does not have a specific handling mechanism to deal with boolean values appropriately, leading to the incorrect behavior observed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to introduce a check to handle boolean values separately before attempting to convert them into date formats. By detecting boolean values and returning the original data without conversion, we can ensure that boolean values do not trigger the date conversion logic, thus resolving the issue reported in the GitHub problem.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Handle boolean values separately
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By introducing a conditional check to handle boolean values separately, the corrected function now ensures that boolean values are not converted into date formats, resolving the issue described in the GitHub problem.
