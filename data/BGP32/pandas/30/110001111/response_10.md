### Analysis
The issue described in the GitHub problem revolves around the `read_json` function with `typ="series"` resulting in an unexpected behavior, specifically converting boolean values into timestamps. The provided buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to be the source of this problem due to incorrect handling of boolean values.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided runtime example and expected values, we can see that the function fails to differentiate between boolean values and date values. When the input data contains boolean values like `True` and `False`, the function mistakenly treats them as if they were date values and attempts to convert them to timestamps. This behavior is not expected, leading to erroneous output and eventual exceptions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `_try_convert_to_date` function to correctly identify boolean values and handle them appropriately. By adding a condition to check for boolean values and handle them differently from date values, we can ensure that the function does not attempt to convert boolean values to timestamps.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional condition to handle boolean values separately, ensuring that they are not incorrectly processed as date values. This change should address the issue described in the GitHub problem.
