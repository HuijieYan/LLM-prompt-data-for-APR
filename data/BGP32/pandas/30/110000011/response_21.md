## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` in the `Parser` class is attempting to convert data to dates, but it has some logic issues leading to unexpected behavior, including the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem. The function is wrongly converting boolean values to dates. This behavior is not desired and inconsistent with user expectations.

## Potential Error Locations:
- Conversion of boolean values to dates.
- Handling of different data types.
- Incorrect interpretation of the data leading to wrong conversions.
- Inconsistent result compared to other data types.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function `_try_convert_to_date` incorrectly treating boolean values as if they were dates. This leads to a situation where the function returns dates for boolean inputs, which is not the intended behavior.

## Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Check the data type of the input data and handle boolean values separately to prevent them from being converted to dates.
2. Implement specific logic to handle boolean values and prevent any unintended conversions.
3. Ensure that the function returns the appropriate data type based on the input type without any inconsistencies.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        if not isinstance(data, np.ndarray) or data.dtype != np.dtype('object'):
            return data, False

        if data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        for date_unit in (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue

        return data, False
```

This corrected version includes additional checks to prevent boolean values from being converted to dates. It also focuses on handling different data types appropriately and returning the expected result without inconsistencies.
