## Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_try_convert_to_date` method of the `Parser` class in the `_json.py` file within the `pandas` library. The issue reported on GitHub relates to the incorrect conversion of a JSON series of booleans to timestamps, causing a `TypeError` to be raised instead of returning a series of boolean values.

## Error Locations:
1. The function attempts to convert the input data into integers if its dtype is "object", which can cause unexpected behavior when dealing with booleans.
2. There is a check for numbers out of range that skips over boolean values.
3. The handling of the date conversion using `to_datetime` is causing the issue by trying to convert boolean values.

## Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the `_try_convert_to_date` function is not handling the conversion of boolean values correctly. The function tries to coerce object types to integers, which is unnecessary and leads to the incorrect behavior when converting booleans to timestamps.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Avoid unnecessary coercion of data types, especially considering booleans are not handled well in the existing code.
2. Ensure that boolean values are properly recognized and not converted during date conversion.
3. Refactor the date conversion logic to handle boolean values appropriately.

## Corrected Version:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        # No need to convert object types to int64
        new_data = data

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        if new_data.dtype == np.bool_:
            return new_data, True

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        
        return data, False
```

By updating the `_try_convert_to_date` function as shown above, the issue reported on GitHub related to the incorrect conversion of booleans to timestamps should be resolved, and the function should now return a series of boolean values as expected.
