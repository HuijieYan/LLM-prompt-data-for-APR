## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` in the `Parser` class is encountering issues specifically related to converting boolean values to datetime objects, which is causing unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue. The function is not handling boolean values appropriately and is mistakenly converting them to datetime values, leading to the TypeError observed in the issue.

## Error Locations:
1. The function is attempting to convert boolean values to datetime objects.
2. The function is not excluding boolean values from the conversion process, leading to the unexpected behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly handling boolean values. It is coercing boolean values to integers (int64) and then attempting to convert them to datetime objects, which results in the unexpected behavior reported in the GitHub issue. This leads to the erroneous conversion of boolean values to datetime timestamps.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that boolean values are excluded from the conversion process to datetime objects. Specifically, boolean values should not go through the conversion steps intended for numeric values. Additionally, we need to handle boolean values separately to ensure that they are correctly identified and retained as boolean values in the output.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function within the `Parser` class, addressing the issues mentioned above:

```python
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # Process numeric values only
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) and not np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.bool_):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

            date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
            for date_unit in date_units:
                try:
                    new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                    continue
                return new_data, True

        return data, False
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly exclude boolean values from going through the datetime conversion logic, ensuring that they are retained as boolean values in the output. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug by maintaining the correct data types and avoiding the TypeError caused by inappropriate conversions.
