## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class and is responsible for trying to convert data into a date column. The issue reported on GitHub is related to `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` resulting in timestamps or an exception, whereas the expected output should be a Series of bools. It was noted that in older versions, the result was a Series of timestamps, while in newer versions, a TypeError is raised.

## Bugs and Error Locations:
1. The function is incorrectly handling the conversion of data to datetime, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The implementation lacks proper checking and handling of input data types.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the function attempting to convert boolean values to datetime, resulting in the unexpected output of timestamps or raising a TypeError. The code is not correctly differentiating between different data types and does not handle the conversion for bool values properly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check for boolean values in the data and handle their conversion appropriately. We should skip the datetime conversion for boolean values and ensure that the output matches the expected data type.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        if new_data.dtype == bool:
            return new_data, True
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for boolean values in the data, and if the data type is bool, we return it as is with a flag indicating successful conversion. This should prevent boolean values from being converted to datetime erroneously.
