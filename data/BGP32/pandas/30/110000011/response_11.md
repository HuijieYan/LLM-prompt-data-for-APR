## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is used to convert data to date format, but it has a bug that causes it to incorrectly convert booleans to timestamps in older versions of Pandas. This bug was reported in the GitHub issue titled "read_json with typ='series' of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception" where users expect a Series of booleans but get timestamps instead.

## Identified Error:
The bug occurs when the input data has dtype "object" and then tries to convert it to int64 directly without considering boolean values. This leads to incorrect conversion and returns timestamps instead of boolean values.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the function not handling boolean values properly during conversion. When the dtype is checked as "object" and an attempt is made to convert it to int64, boolean values are not considered in this conversion process, leading to the bug where booleans are incorrectly converted to timestamps.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to correctly handle boolean values during conversion. We should check if the dtype is "bool" and handle this case separately to ensure that boolean values are not converted to timestamps.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # Handle boolean values separately
            return new_data, True

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

By adding the condition `elif new_data.dtype == "bool":`, we ensure that boolean values are handled separately and not converted to timestamps incorrectly. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensures that booleans are not converted to timestamps in the output Series.
