The error message indicates that the function is attempting to convert a boolean value to a datetime object, which is not possible and leads to a TypeError. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is called during the process of parsing JSON data in `read_json`, specifically when `typ="series"`. 

The root cause of the bug is that the function is trying to convert boolean values to datetime objects, which is not a valid operation. To fix this bug, we need to handle boolean values differently and ensure that the function correctly identifies the data type before attempting conversions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By adding an `elif` block to handle boolean values and avoid conversion to datetime, we prevent the TypeError and ensure that boolean values remain as they are. This correction aligns with the expected behavior of returning a Series of boolean values as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Feel free to test this corrected function to confirm that it resolves the issue.
