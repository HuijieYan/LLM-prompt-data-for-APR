### Analysis:
- The provided buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method within the `Parser` class in the file `_json.py`.
- The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is raised when trying to convert a boolean value to a datetime object.
- The GitHub issue states that in older versions of Pandas, when using `typ="series"` with `read_json` on a list of booleans, it resulted in a Series of timestamp values.
- The current behavior (error) was introduced in Pandas version 1.0.0.
- The error occurs when trying to convert non-datetime-compatible data types (like booleans) to datetime.

### Error Location:
- The potential error location in the code is when the function attempts to convert the data to datetime with `to_datetime`.
- Specifically, the issue arises when the data contains boolean values that cannot be converted to datetime.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The cause of the bug is an inconsistency in handling boolean values when trying to convert them to datetime.
- Boolean values are not compatible with datetime operations, which leads to the `TypeError` being raised.
- This behavior changed in Pandas 1.0.0, where the error was introduced (triggered by the GitHub issue).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to check for boolean values before attempting to convert the data to datetime.
- If the data contains boolean values, we should skip the datetime conversion and return the data as it is.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
        
        # Check for boolean values and handle them accordingly
        if new_data.dtype == 'bool':
            return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

With this corrected version of the function, boolean values will be identified and the conversion to datetime will be skipped, resolving the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
