## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function arises from the incorrect handling of the data type conversion. When the input data is in object dtype and an attempt is made to convert it to int64, the function is not updating the data variable correctly. As a result, the subsequent checks and conversions are not applied as intended, leading to incorrect behavior in parsing the date column.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of the data type from object to int64 is properly handled and the new_data variable is updated accordingly. Additionally, we should review the logic for checking if the values are within range and make sure the datetime conversion is attempted correctly for different date units.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Returns a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By ensuring that the new_data variable is properly updated after type conversion and addressing the range check and datetime conversion logic, this corrected version should pass the failing test case.
