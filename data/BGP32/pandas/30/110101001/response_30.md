### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is trying to convert data to a date column by coercing object types to `int64`, handling numbers that are out of range, and trying to convert to datetime using different units. However, the bug seems to be related to the handling of object types and out of range numbers, leading to incorrect behavior in the function.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function is incorrectly assuming that converting data to `int64` will work for all object types, which may not be the case.
2. The check for numbers that are out of range is not correctly identifying the in-range values, causing the function to return incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the conversion of object types to `int64` properly before proceeding with further processing.
2. Correctly identify numbers that are out of range and handle them accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='coerce')  # Convert to numeric instead of assuming int64
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data <= self.min_stamp)  # Corrected condition for in-range numbers
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

By making these corrections in the function, it should now handle object types and out of range numbers correctly, passing the failing test provided.
