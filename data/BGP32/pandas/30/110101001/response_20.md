### Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` seems to have a logic issue when trying to convert data to date format. From the runtime values provided in Case 1, it appears that the function incorrectly assumes the data is of type `int64` when it is actually a `RangeIndex`. This could be causing the function to fail in converting the data to datetime.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes the data type is `int64` and then tries to convert it to datetime, leading to a failure in the conversion process.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data is appropriately converted to the correct format before attempting to convert it to datetime. We should also handle the `RangeIndex` type data in a way that allows it to be converted accurately.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version, we handle the conversion of data appropriately and directly attempt to convert it to datetime. This should address the issue and allow the function to successfully parse the data into a date column.
