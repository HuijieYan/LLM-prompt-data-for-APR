### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function `_try_convert_to_date`, the issue lies in the logic for checking if numbers are in range. The current implementation checks if numbers are in range by comparing them to a minimum timestamp `self.min_stamp` and also comparing them to `iNaT` (Not-a-Time) value from pandas. This logic is flawed as it does not appropriately handle the comparison with `iNaT` which is causing incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to refine the logic for checking if numbers are in range by excluding the comparison with `iNaT` and ensuring that the comparison is only made with the minimum timestamp `self.min_stamp`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

By removing the comparison with `iNaT` and ensuring that numbers are only compared with `self.min_stamp`, the corrected version of the function should handle the comparison accurately and resolve the bug.
