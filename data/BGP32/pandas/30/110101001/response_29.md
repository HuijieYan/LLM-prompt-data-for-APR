### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function is caused by an incorrect check for numbers out of range in the input data. The function incorrectly returns the original data instead of converting it to date format when numbers are out of range. This results in a failure when trying to parse the input data as a series of booleans.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling numbers that are out of range. Instead of immediately returning the original data, we should attempt to convert the data to date format even if some numbers are out of range. This way, the function will correctly parse the input data into the expected format.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # always attempt date conversion
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            return new_data, True
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
    
    return data, False
```

By modifying the logic to always attempt date conversion regardless of numbers being out of range, the corrected version of the function will now correctly handle the input data and parse it into the expected date format. This fix should make the failing test pass successfully.
