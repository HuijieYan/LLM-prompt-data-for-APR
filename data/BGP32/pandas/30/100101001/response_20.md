The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to be related to the handling of data types and conversions. The function is trying to convert the input data into a date column by first attempting to convert objects into `int64` dtype and then checking if the values are within a specified range. However, the logic seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect results.

The issue in this case arises from the conversion of the input data to `int64` dtype without proper handling of the existing data type. The function assumes that converting all object types to `int64` will work, but this is not always the case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of object types to `int64` only occurs when it is safe to do so. Additionally, the range check logic needs to be adjusted to correctly identify out-of-range values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='ignore')
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data >= self.min_stamp)  # Adjusted condition for checking range
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version handles the conversion of object types more robustly by using `pd.to_numeric` with `errors='ignore` to avoid errors. Additionally, the range check logic has been adjusted to correctly identify values that are out of range by checking if they are greater than or equal to `self.min_stamp`.

This fix should address the issues encountered in the failing test and ensure that the `_try_convert_to_date` function works correctly.
