The issue in the provided `_try_convert_to_date` function is that it wrongly assumes that converting the `data` to `int64` will handle all cases of date conversion. However, this approach is incorrect and leads to the function returning the original `data` without actually converting it to a date.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the conversion to date formats for the given input data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    # Attempt to convert data to datetime
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="raise")
        return new_data, True
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

By directly using `to_datetime` on the `data`, we ensure that proper date conversion handling is done, instead of assuming that casting to `int64` is sufficient.

This corrected version should now correctly convert the data to datetime and pass the failing test.
