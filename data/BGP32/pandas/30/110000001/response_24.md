## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert a numpy array into a date column by parsing it in various date formats. The function checks if the input data is empty, tries to coerce the data into integer format if it's in object format, and then checks if the data is within a range for numbers before converting it into a datetime object.

## Identification of the Bug:
The potential error locations within the function include:
1. The comparison of `new_data.dtype` with `"object"` may not work as expected due to dtype comparison method.
2. The comparison of data types and checking for numbers within range using `np.number` might not yield the intended results.
3. The loop through different date units may not handle exceptions properly, potentially leading to incorrect results.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug could potentially be caused by incorrect comparisons of data types, failure to handle exceptions properly, or not accurately checking if numbers are within range before conversion to date. These issues may result in incorrect parsing of the input data and possibly producing inaccurate date columns.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure correct comparison of data types for conversion.
2. Properly check if numbers are within range before converting to a date.
3. Handle exceptions raised during conversion to date units in the loop.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == np.object:
            try:
                new_data = data.astype(np.int64)
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected version of the function:
1. Correct comparison of data types using `np.object`.
2. Check if numbers are within range using `np.issubdtype`.
3. Ensure exceptions are properly handled during conversion to date units in the loop.

By making these changes, the function should now operate correctly and accurately convert the input data into a date column.
