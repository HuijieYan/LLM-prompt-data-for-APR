## Analysis:
The `_try_convert_to_date` function is part of a class named `Parser`, which seems to be responsible for parsing ndarrays into date columns. The function attempts to convert the input data into date format using different strategies, such as coercing object types into int64, handling out-of-range numbers, and converting to datetime using different units.

## Identified potential errors:
1. The initial check for an empty `data` array might not work as intended.
2. The reassignment of `new_data` may not reflect changes correctly.
3. The condition `if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number)` could be problematic.
4. The logic for handling out-of-range numbers may not be accurate.
5. The loop over `date_units` to convert to datetime might not be working properly.

## Bug cause:
The bug in the original function lies in the handling of `new_data` and the conversion process to date format. There are discrepancies in how the data is processed and checked for different types and ranges.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the data is properly checked for empty arrays before processing.
2. Make sure that the conversion and reassignment of `new_data` are carried out correctly.
3. Adjust the conditions for handling numbers and checking for out-of-range values.
4. Verify the loop over `date_units` and the conversion to datetime for accuracy.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if len(data) == 0:
        return data, False

    new_data = data.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version:
- We explicitly check for an empty array using `len(data) == 0`.
- We create a copy of `data` to avoid modifying the original array unnecessarily.
- The conversion and reassignment of `new_data` are corrected.
- The conditions for handling numbers and checking for out-of-range values are adjusted.
- The loop over `date_units` and the conversion to datetime are reviewed and corrected for accuracy.
