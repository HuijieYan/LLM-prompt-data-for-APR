## Analysis:
The `Parser` class contains a method `_try_convert_to_date` that is intended to handle the conversion of data to a date column. However, there are several potential error locations within this function that may be causing bugs. 

1. The condition `if not len(data):` might not be handling empty data as intended.
2. The conversion of data to int64 when the dtype is "object" could be problematic.
3. The check for numbers that are out of range may not be properly handled.
4. The loop that iterates through `date_units` and attempts to convert data to datetime may have issues with the handling of exceptions.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current implementation of `_try_convert_to_date` may be due to incorrect handling of data types, error conditions, or exceptions. The function may not be returning the correct output or handling all possible scenarios for converting data to a date column.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that empty data is handled properly without errors.
2. Verify the data type conversion to int64 for "object" dtype and handle any exceptions.
3. Improve the check for numbers that are out of range.
4. Refactor the loop that converts data to datetime to handle exceptions and return the correct result.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # Handle empty data
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data.copy()
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
    
        # Check for numbers out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="ignore", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

In this corrected version:
- Proper handling of empty data is ensured at the beginning of the function.
- The conversion of data to int64 is done on a copy of the data to prevent inplace modification.
- Improved handling of exceptions during the conversion to datetime.
- Minor adjustments to improve code readability and maintainability.
