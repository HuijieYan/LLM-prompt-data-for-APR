### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. This function tries to convert a ndarray-like input data into a date column by parsing it into various date formats. The bug seems to be related to handling different data types and formats within the function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conversion of data to `int64` may not be handled correctly.
2. Checking for numbers out of range might be missing some edge cases.
3. The loop for trying different date units may not be functioning as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug appears to be caused by improper handling of different data types and date formats within the function. The conversion of data to `int64` and checking for values out of range may not be accurate, leading to incorrect output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure correct handling of data types and conversions.
2. Validate the checks for numbers out of range.
3. Carefully loop through different date units to successfully convert the data.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data.copy()  # Copy the data to avoid modifying the original
        if data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
``` 

In this corrected version, we have made the following changes:
1. Added `new_data = data.copy()` to ensure we are working with a copy of the data.
2. Changed `if new_data.dtype == "object":` to `if data.dtype == "object":` to correctly handle object data type.
3. Used `np.issubdtype` to check if the data type is a number.
4. Modified the `in_range` check to correctly handle values out of range.
5. Fixed the loop for trying different date units and returning the converted data.

This corrected version should address the potential issues and improve the function's behavior.
