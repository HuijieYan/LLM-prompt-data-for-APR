The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function arises from the incorrect handling of data types and the logic for checking if numbers are out of range. 

The bug occurs when the input `data` is a `RangeIndex` or a boolean `Series` since the function incorrectly handles these types when trying to convert them to date formats. Specifically, the function mistakenly treats them as if they were numeric data. Additionally, the bug causes the function to return the original data even when it should have successfully converted it to a date format.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle non-numeric data types, such as `RangeIndex` and boolean `Series`, during the conversion process. We also need to ensure that the function returns the successfully converted data when appropriate.

Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if isinstance(data, Series) and data.dtype == 'bool':
        # Convert boolean Series to datetime based on True and False values
        new_data = data.replace({True: '1970-01-01', False: 'NaT'})
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce')
        success = not isna(new_data).any()
        return new_data, success

    if isna(data).any():
        return data, False

    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(data, errors='raise', unit=self.date_unit)
        success = not isna(new_data).any()
        return new_data, success
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles boolean `Series` by converting them to datetime objects based on the given conditions. It also correctly processes other data types and ensures that successfully converted data is returned along with a success flag.
