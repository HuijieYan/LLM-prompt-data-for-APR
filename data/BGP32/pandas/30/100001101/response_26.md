The bug in the provided function `_try_convert_to_date` is likely due to the incorrect handling of the data type check for date conversion. The function incorrectly assumes that the data type of the input needs to be converted to "int64" before performing the date conversion. This assumption leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the input data is not of type "int64", causing the function to return the original input data without successful date conversion.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle different data types correctly for date conversion. Instead of converting the data to "int64" upfront, we should directly attempt date conversion using the `to_datetime` function with appropriate error handling.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=self.date_unit)
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        return data, False

    return new_data, True
```

This corrected version of the function directly tries to convert the input data to date format using the `to_datetime` function, handling any errors that may occur during the conversion process. This approach ensures that the function correctly attempts date conversion without unnecessary type conversions that might disrupt the process.
