The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to convert a given data column into a date format based on certain conditions. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the data type conversion and the range check.

### Error Location:
1. The conversion of the data column to `int64` when the dtype is "object" is problematic.
2. The range check implementation based on `_values` attribute and `iNaT` is incorrect.
3. The loop over `date_units` for date conversion might not iterate through all units correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
- In Case 1, the input data is a `RangeIndex` which is not an object dtype, but the function tries to convert it to `int64` unnecessarily. This leads to incorrect results in `in_range` and subsequent date conversion.
- Additionally, the range check logic based on `_values` and `iNaT` may not accurately determine if all values are within range. This may cause incorrect results in determining whether parsing is successful.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the dtype is "object" before attempting to convert it to `int64`.
2. Modify the range check logic to accurately identify values within range.
3. Ensure that the loop over `date_units` correctly attempts date conversion for all units.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    in_range = (
        (new_data >= self.min_stamp) | isna(new_data) | (new_data == iNaT)
    )
    if not in_range.all():
        return data, False

    for date_unit in self.date_unit or self._STAMP_UNITS:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version addresses the issues by adding a proper range check logic and adjusting the dtype conversion condition. The loop over `date_units` is also fixed to ensure proper date conversion attempts.
