### Analysis:
1. The `Parser` class contains the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which is intended to parse a numpy array-like data into a date column.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly handling boolean data and coercing it to int64 and then trying to parse it as a date, resulting in incorrect output.
3. The failing test case involves reading a JSON list of booleans and expecting a Series of boolean values, but the function is producing unexpected datetime values.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of boolean data and ensure that it is not coerced to int64 unnecessarily.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function tries to coerce boolean data to int64, which leads to incorrect parsing as dates.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data correctly and prevent unnecessary coercion to int64. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object" and new_data.dtype != "bool":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific check for boolean data and prevents unnecessary coercion to int64, ensuring that boolean data is not incorrectly parsed as dates.

By using this corrected function, the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` should now pass as expected.
