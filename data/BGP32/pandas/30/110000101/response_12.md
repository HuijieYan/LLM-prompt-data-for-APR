## Analysis
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is supposed to convert data into a date column. However, there are several issues in the implementation:
1. The condition `if not len(data)` checks if the length of the data is zero, which is incorrect. It should check if the data is empty.
2. The variable `new_data` is being assigned the same value as `data` initially, but the intention seems to be to modify `new_data` later in the function.
3. The check for numbers that are out of range is not correctly implemented, as demonstrated by the failing test case 1.
4. The loop over `date_units` is intended to try converting the data using different units until successful, but it currently returns immediately after the first conversion attempt.

## Fix Strategy
1. Correct the condition for checking an empty data.
2. Ensure that `new_data` is initialized as a copy of `data` to avoid modifying the original data.
3. Fix the check for numbers that are out of range.
4. Modify the loop to try converting the data with all date units before returning.
