### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by trying to convert boolean values to datetime in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. The function incorrectly attempts to convert boolean values to datetime, leading to a `TypeError` since booleans are not convertible to datetime. This behavior was changed in Pandas version `1.0.0`, resulting in the raised exception.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the input data contains boolean values differently. Since boolean values are not convertible to datetime, we should return the data as it is and indicate that the conversion was not successful.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version will now handle boolean data separately, simply returning the data itself and indicating that the conversion was not successful. This change aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the error caused by trying to convert boolean values to datetime.
