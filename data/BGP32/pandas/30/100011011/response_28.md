### Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to convert input data into a date column, handling different data types and formats in the process. However, the bug causes a `TypeError` when it tries to convert a boolean value to a datetime, which is not a valid conversion. This issue arises in the context of reading JSON data with `typ="series"` option, where boolean values are incorrectly treated as if they need to be converted to datetimes.

The runtime values provided for the buggy function show that the input data is a `RangeIndex` representing boolean values. However, the function attempts to convert them to `int64` and subsequently tries to convert these numbers to datetime values. This triggers the `TypeError` as observed in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug is that the function does not properly check for boolean values before trying to convert them to datetimes. It fails to distinguish between different data types, leading to an inappropriate conversion attempt.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check for boolean values before attempting any conversion. Additionally, we should handle boolean values separately, keeping them as they are without attempting any datetime conversions.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    if data.dtype == bool:  # Check for boolean values
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version now includes a check for boolean values before any conversion attempts, preventing the `TypeError` observed in the failing tests.
