## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column. However, the current implementation has a bug that causes it to incorrectly handle the conversion process for certain data types, leading to failures in tests.

In the provided first case, the input data is a `RangeIndex`, and the function mistakenly converts it into an `int64` dtype. This conversion is incorrect and leads to the final result being the same as the original data. This incorrect conversion prevents the function from effectively parsing the data.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the data types and performs appropriate conversions. Specifically, we need to handle boolean data separately to ensure they are correctly parsed into a date format. Additionally, we should eliminate unnecessary conversions that do not contribute to the parsing process.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data, errors='ignore')
            except ValueError:
                pass

        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors='coerce')

        return new_data, True
```

This corrected version specifically handles boolean data and object data with integer-like values separately, allowing for correct parsing and conversion to date formats.
