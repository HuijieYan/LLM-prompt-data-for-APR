## Issue Analysis
The issue relates to the `read_json` function in pandas when `typ="series"` is used with a JSON list of booleans. Prior to version 1.0.0, the function incorrectly converted the booleans into timestamp values instead of a Pandas Series of booleans. Starting from version 1.0.0, it raised a TypeError. The expected behavior is to return a Series of booleans consistently with other cases and without raising an exception.

## Bug Identification
The bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function seems to stem from wrongly handling boolean data, which leads to conversion attempts to timestamps rather than preserving the original boolean values when the data type is object. This behavior results in unexpected output and the TypeError observed in the failing test when trying to convert boolean data to datetime.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the function mistakenly converting boolean values to timestamps when handling object data. This incorrect conversion causes issues when attempting to generate a Series of boolean values from the input.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to be adjusted to correctly identify boolean data and retain the original boolean values when necessary. The conversion logic should distinguish between numeric and non-numeric data types to preserve the appropriate data type in the output Series.

## Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # Handle boolean data separately to preserve the original values
        if new_data.apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, bool)).all():
            return new_data, True

        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This fix includes additional logic to handle boolean data specifically and avoid unnecessary conversion attempts to timestamps. It ensures that boolean values are retained as-is in the output Series, resolving the issue reported in the failing test and GitHub report.
