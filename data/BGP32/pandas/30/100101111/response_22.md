### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data into a date column, handling various formats and types.
2. The bug seems to be in the section where numbers out of range are ignored for conversion to timestamps, leading to incorrect return values.
3. In the failing test, the function is expected to convert a JSON list of booleans into a Pandas Series of boolean values, but due to the bug, it tries to convert them to timestamps.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that boolean data is correctly handled and not treated as timestamps.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of boolean data in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. It mistakenly tries to convert boolean data into timestamps, causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the function to explicitly check for boolean data and handle it separately, ensuring that it is not treated as timestamp data.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like data into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False  # Return immediately if the data type is boolean

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected version now explicitly checks and handles boolean data, preventing it from being incorrectly converted into timestamps. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series`.
