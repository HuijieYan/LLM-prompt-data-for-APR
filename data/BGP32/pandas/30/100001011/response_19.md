### Issue Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data to a date column using different date units. The bug causes incorrect handling of input data that is already in the correct format, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential errors. This issue is reflected in the GitHub problem where a series of boolean values is expected, but instead, an exception is raised due to incorrect conversion.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the section where the function tries to coerce object type data to an integer type. This conversion sometimes leads to improper handling of data that is already in the correct format, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect conversion of data that is already in the correct format (i.e., boolean in this case) to integer format. This conversion leads to errors when attempting to further process the data as if it were not already in the expected format.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function does not unnecessarily convert data that is already in the correct format.
2. Handle different data types (such as boolean) separately to avoid unnecessary type conversions.
3. Adjust the logic to check for the correct data type before attempting any conversions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce objects in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            if new_data.dtype == "bool":
                return new_data, True
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version of the function includes a separate check for boolean data and ensures that it is directly returned without unnecessary conversions. This adjustment should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem by correctly handling boolean data to avoid exceptions during conversion attempts.
