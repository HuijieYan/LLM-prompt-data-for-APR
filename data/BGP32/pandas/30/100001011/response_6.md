The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` has a bug related to the processing of data for date conversion. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return data converted to timestamps when it should handle boolean values. This behavior is observed in the presented GitHub issue where a Series of boolean values is expected, but the function incorrectly converts them to timestamps.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the section of code where the function checks if the data is numerical and within the expected range for timestamp conversion. The issue arises from the fact that boolean values are mistakenly inferred as numerical and passed through the timestamp conversion process.

### Bug Cause:
1. When the function encounters boolean values, it converts them to integer type, assuming they could potentially represent epoch times.
2. The function then checks if the data is numerical and within the expected timestamp range. Since boolean values would not conform to this constraint, the function incorrectly processes them further.
3. Ultimately, the function attempts to convert the boolean values to timestamps, leading to the incorrect output of timestamp values instead of the expected boolean series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the boolean data separately from the numerical data conversion process. By identifying boolean values early on and preventing them from going through the timestamp conversion logic, the function can correctly return the boolean series as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected version, if the data type is boolean, the function immediately returns the data without attempting any conversions. This modification ensures that boolean values are handled correctly and not passed through the timestamp conversion logic.
