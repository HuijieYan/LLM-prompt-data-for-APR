### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an array-like input into a date column by converting it to datetime objects. However, there are several issues causing it to fail, as seen in the GitHub issue related to `read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools. The function encounters a problem converting boolean values to datetime objects, which leads to unexpected behavior, such as raising exceptions or returning timestamps.

### Bug Locations:
1. The code attempts to convert `new_data` to `int64` when the `dtype` is `'object'`. This conversion may not be appropriate for the input data, especially when dealing with booleans.
2. The comparison against `self.min_stamp` and `iNaT` may not be relevant for boolean data and can cause incorrect filtering.
3. The attempt to convert data to datetime objects using different units may not handle boolean input properly.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is the mishandling of boolean data as if it were datetime data. The function fails to appropriately process boolean values, leading to unexpected behavior and raising exceptions when trying to convert them to datetime objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle boolean data separately from other data types. When encountering booleans, the function should directly convert them to the appropriate boolean type without attempting datetime conversions. Additionally, the unnecessary comparisons and conversions for non-boolean data should be adjusted to avoid incorrect filtering or conversion errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray-like input into a date column by handling boolean data separately.

    Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # No conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == 'object':
        try:
            new_data = data.astype('int64')
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            new_data = data
    else:
        new_data = data

    # Handle boolean data separately to prevent datetime conversion
    if new_data.dtype == bool:
        return new_data, True

    # Ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Attempt to convert data to datetime objects
    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors='raise', unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

By handling boolean data separately and adjusting the conversion logic for other data types, the corrected function should be able to handle the input data appropriately and prevent errors related to boolean-to-datetime conversion.
