## Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is designed to parse an ndarray-like structure into a date column. However, there are issues with the conversion logic, especially when dealing with boolean values, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

One key problem is that the function incorrectly handles boolean values, attempting to convert them to datetime values instead of keeping them as booleans. This leads to unexpected behavior and conflicts with the expected output.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when the function encounters boolean values in the input data. Instead of preserving these values as booleans, the function attempts to convert them to datetime values, leading to a TypeError.

## Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to modify the function to handle boolean values appropriately. It should identify boolean dtype columns and handle them differently, ensuring booleans are preserved without attempting unnecessary datetime conversions.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    # Handling boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected version contains a specific handling for boolean dtype columns, ensuring that they are returned as-is without undergoing unnecessary datetime conversions. By making this adjustment, the function should now work correctly and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
