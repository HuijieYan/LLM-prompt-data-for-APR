### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is being used to try and convert data into a date column. The issue is related to the conversion logic of the function, causing unexpected behavior and errors such as returning timestamps instead of boolean values in certain cases.

### Error Locations:
1. The conversion logic inside the `try` block where it attempts to convert `object` dtype to `int64`.
2. Conditions for checking if numbers are out of range and subsequently returning false.
3. The loop for converting data to datetime in different units.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of data conversion and validation logic within the function. Due to this, incorrect data types are returned, leading to the failure of the provided test cases and resulting in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Refactor the conversion logic to accurately handle different data types and conversion scenarios.
2. Ensure proper validation checks and conditions are in place to prevent returning incorrect data types.
3. Correctly handle the conversion of boolean data types to avoid returning timestamps.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_numeric(new_data)
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data < self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="ignore", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

In the corrected version:
- `pd.to_numeric` is used for conversion.
- The condition for checking numbers that are out of range has been corrected.
- The conversion to datetime has `errors='ignore'` now.

By implementing these changes, the function should now handle conversions accurately and fix the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
