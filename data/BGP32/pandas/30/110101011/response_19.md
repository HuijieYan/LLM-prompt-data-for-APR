### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is attempting to convert data to a date column by checking for object-type dtype, coercing to int64, checking if numbers are in range, and then trying to convert to datetime.
- The issue arises when trying to parse a list of booleans where it wrongly interprets them as numbers, leading to incorrect behavior.
- The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` is designed to read a list of booleans and convert them to a Series of boolean values, which is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

### Bug Cause:
- When the function encounters a dtype of object (in this case, a list of booleans), it attempts to convert it to `int64`. This leads to incorrect interpretation of booleans as numbers.
- The logic to handle boolean values during the conversion process is missing, causing the function to improperly process boolean values as numbers.

### Fix Strategy:
- Detect boolean values correctly and handle them during the conversion process to ensure that they are not mistakenly interpreted as numbers.
- Implement a check for boolean dtype and handle the conversion accordingly to output a Series of boolean values as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        # Check for boolean dtype and convert to boolean array
        if all(isinstance(val, bool) for val in new_data):
            return Series(new_data), True

        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # Ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

This corrected version now checks for boolean dtype in the input data and correctly handles it to output a Series of boolean values as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` passes successfully.
