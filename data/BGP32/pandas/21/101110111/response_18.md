## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class handles different types of key inputs, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and list-like objects.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a KeyError to be raised when trying to access a non-existing entry in the series using different types of key inputs.
3. The bug occurs when a list-like key input is passed to the series, resulting in an internal operation that raises an error due to a mismatch in how list-based indexers are treated compared to other indexers.

## Bug Explanation
1. The `_get_with` function checks for different types of key inputs to determine how to access the elements in the series.
2. When a list-like key input is encountered, the buggy function enters a block that processes the key further. However, the logic inside this block is causing the error when trying to access the series with a key that does not exist in the index.
3. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised, indicating that the key used for indexing is not found in the series' index. This expectation is based on the behavior of other indexers like ndarray, Index, and Series, which correctly raise a KeyError in such cases.

## Fixing Strategy
1. To fix the bug, we need to address the mismatch in how list-like indexers are handled compared to other indexers.
2. The correction should ensure that when a list-like key is used to access the series, it behaves consistently with other types of indexers in terms of error handling.
3. Adjust the logic in the `if not is_list_like(key)` block to handle list-like keys correctly and raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the series' index.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys more consistently with other types of indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function includes the modification to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring that a KeyError is raised when the key is not found in the series' index. This change aligns the behavior with the expectations of the failing test and resolves the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.
