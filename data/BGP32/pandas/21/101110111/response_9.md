To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in how different types of key inputs are handled. The issue arises when a list-like key is passed to the function, resulting in a KeyError even though other types of keys are handled correctly. Since the test cases are expecting consistent behavior across all types of key inputs, we should modify the function to treat list-like keys in a similar manner to other key types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is neither list-like nor array-like
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        key = [key]

    # Infer the key type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types
    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the change as described above, the function now correctly handles list-like keys, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of keys. This correction should make the function pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values specified.
