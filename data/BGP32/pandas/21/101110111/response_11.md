Based on the provided information, the issue seems to stem from the inconsistent behavior of how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers within the `Series` class in Pandas. The failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, a `KeyError` is raised, instead of returning `NaN`, which is the expected behavior in other cases.

A potential cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the issue:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # Existing functions and class declarations

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
            if not self.index.isin(key).all():
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle list-like indexers along with other types of array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior. The function checks if the elements in the key are present in the index and raises a `KeyError` if any key is not found.

This modification should address the issue described in the failing test and align the behavior with the expected outputs for all types of indexers.
