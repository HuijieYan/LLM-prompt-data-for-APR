## Fixing the buggy function

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class contains a logical flaw when handling different types of indexers. The issue arises when a list-like indexer is passed, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency has been noted in the GitHub issue as well.

### Potential error locations:
1. Handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.
2. Determining the type of key to decide the indexing method.

### Cause of the bug:
When a list-like indexer is passed to the `_get_with` function, the bug occurs as it is not handled consistently with other types of indexers. The inconsistency in behavior results in a KeyError being raised when using a list indexer, unlike other types of indexers like np.array or Index.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, the function should treat list-like indexers in the same manner as other types of valid indexers.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like indexers consistently with other types
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer (self.iloc)
            # or label-based (self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")
```

### Explanation of the corrected version:
1. The corrected version now checks if the key is list-like using the `is_list_like(key)` function.
2. If the key is list-like, it directly uses `self.loc[key]` to handle the indexing consistently for all types of valid indexers.
3. The remaining logic for handling other types of indexers remains the same as before, ensuring proper indexing based on the type of key.

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of valid indexers and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
