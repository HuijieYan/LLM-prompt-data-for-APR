We can observe that the buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has a bug that causes inconsistency when indexing with different types of indexers, specifically between array-like and list-like indexers. The bug results in a KeyError when using a list indexer even though the other types of indexers work correctly.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The code path for list-like indexers contains a logical error that leads to the KeyError being raised.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the code path for list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior with array-like indexers. We should modify the logic for list-like indexers to match the behavior of other types of indexers when accessing elements from the Series.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments as described, the corrected function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, passing the failing test and aligning with the expected input/output values for all provided cases. It should also address the GitHub issue related to the inconsistency in indexing behavior with different types of indexers.
