To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, the issue stems from the discrepancy in handling different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function should treat all indexers consistently to align with user expectations.

The main strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that all indexers, including list indexers, are treated consistently. This involves updating the logic for handling different types of indexers in the function to handle list indexers appropriately without causing a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensuring key is treated as an Index

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating `ensure_index(key)` in the function, the bug related to inconsistent handling of list indexers is fixed. The updated logic ensures that all types of indexers are treated uniformly, aligning with user expectations and resolving the KeyError issue highlighted in the failing test. This fix should resolve the problem in the GitHub issue related to the API inconsistency in indexing behavior.
