## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers (`key`) such as slices, DataFrame, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. 
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing whether an appropriate error message is raised when trying to access an index that does not exist in the `Series`.
3. The specific failing case involves passing a `Series` object as the indexer (`key`) parameter, which results in the `KeyError` not being raised as expected. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue.
4. The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the case where a `Series` object is passed as an indexer. When it encounters a `list-like` object (such as a `Series`), it tries to treat it as a valid key directly without converting it to the appropriate index type.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `key` passed to the function is an instance of a `Series`.
2. If it is a `Series`, extract the values from the `Series` and convert them to a standard list before continuing with the processing.
3. Update the logic of handling different types of indexers to handle the case of a list of values derived from a `Series`.

## Corrected Implementation:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.to_list()

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a condition to handle `Series` objects as indexers, converting them to list type before processing, the corrected implementation ensures consistency in handling indexers of various types. This fix should address the issue highlighted in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
