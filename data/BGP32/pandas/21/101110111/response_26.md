### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` module aims to handle various types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The failing test case is supposed to test the behavior when using a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series as an indexer, where the expected result is raising a `KeyError` due to no match in the index.
3. The error message indicates that the current behavior is not consistent across different types of indexers.
4. The problematic part seems to be the handling of a list-like key in the `_get_with` function, as it doesn't raise a `KeyError` when it should.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the conditional check for a non-list-like key. The code returns `self.loc[key]`, which doesn't raise a `KeyError` in the case where the key doesn't exist in the index.

### Fix:
Modify the part handling non-list-like keys such that it raises a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index.__class__.__name__}")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the corrected function will raise a `KeyError` when attempting to access a key that does not exist in the index, for both list-like and non-list-like keys. This modification aligns the behavior with the expected outcome in the failing test cases.
