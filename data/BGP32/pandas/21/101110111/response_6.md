## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, it fails to properly handle list-like keys, leading to a KeyError in certain cases. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of indexing a Series with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series containing keys that do not match any values in the Series index.

The buggy function fails in cases where the key is list-like, such as an ndarray, Index, or Series, by not properly handling the indexing operation. This leads to the KeyError being raised unexpectedly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function is primarily related to how list-like keys are processed for indexing. The function does not properly handle list-like keys, such as ndarray, Index, or Series, leading to a KeyError when these keys do not match any values in the Series index. This issue stems from a lack of consistent handling of different types of indexers within the function.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure consistent handling of list-like keys. This includes properly converting list-like keys to a suitable format for indexing while handling the case where the keys do not match any values in the Series index. By making the function handle list-like keys properly, we can avoid the unexpected KeyError and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we have corrected the handling of list-like keys for indexing a Series. This correction ensures that the function properly deals with different types of indexers, preventing the unexpected KeyError from occurring in cases where the keys do not match any values in the Series index.
