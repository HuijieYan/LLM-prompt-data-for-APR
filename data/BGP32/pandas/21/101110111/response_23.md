## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is not handling list-like indexers properly, causing a `KeyError` when indexing with a list. The function checks for different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other types, but it fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to the `KeyError` in the failing test cases. The issue is related to the inconsistent behavior of how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the part of the function where it checks the type of the indexer and prepares it for further processing. Specifically, the bug arises when the indexer is a list-like object.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function fails to properly handle list-like indexers, causing a `KeyError` when trying to access elements in the Series with a list as the indexer. The function incorrectly processes list indexers, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors in the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly within the `_get_with` function. We should modify the logic to properly process the list indexers and avoid the `KeyError` when accessing elements using a list as the indexer.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers, we ensure that list indexers are processed correctly, avoiding the `KeyError` and satisfying the input/output values for the failing test cases.
