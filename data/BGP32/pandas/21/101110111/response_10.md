## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs and return the corresponding values based on the type of the key.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file is checking the behavior of the function for different types of keys, including a case where a list-like key is provided.
3. The failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when accessing the Series with a key that does not match any item in the index. However, the actual behavior is inconsistent for various types of `key`.
4. The failing test fails because the behavior when using a list-like key is different from other types of keys, leading to inconsistencies in error handling.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling list-like keys. When a list-like key that does not match any index item is provided, the function does not raise a `KeyError` as expected by the test. This inconsistency in error handling causes the failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should uniformly handle different types of keys and consistently raise a `KeyError` when a key does not match any item in the index. Specifically, for list-like keys, the function should behave the same as for other types of keys.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case when the key is not in the index
    if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the behavior for handling list-like keys is consistent with other types of keys, ensuring a `KeyError` is raised when a key does not match any item in the index. This revised behavior aligns with the expectations of the failing test cases.
