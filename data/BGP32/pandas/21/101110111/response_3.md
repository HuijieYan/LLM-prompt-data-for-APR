## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is not handling array-like indexers (e.g., np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) properly when used with `ser[key]`.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is not able to retrieve the expected value when using an array-like indexer with `ser[key]`.
3. The error message indicates that the indexer is not recognized in the index.
4. The expected input/output values show that the indexers are of different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and need to be handled correctly by the `_get_with` function.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of `pandas` does not properly handle array-like indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series when used with `ser[key]`. This leads to a KeyError when attempting to access the index, as the indexer is not recognized as part of the index. As a result, the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` fails to retrieve the expected value from the Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class to properly handle array-like indexers by checking their types and extracting the necessary values for indexing.
2. Ensure that the indexer is recognized within the index and return the appropriate values.
3. Modify the function to handle different types of indexers, including list, ndarray, Index, and Series, based on the type of the indexer provided.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling different types of indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, Series)):
        key = key.to_list()
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key] if isinstance(key, list) else self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating these changes, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle array-like indexers when used with the `ser[key]` operation, resolving the KeyError and ensuring the expected values are retrieved from the Series.
