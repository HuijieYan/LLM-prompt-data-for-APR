## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas has an issue with how it handles different types of indexes. When a list-like key is provided, the function fails to correctly handle it, leading to a `KeyError`. The issue arises when the key is in the form of a list of values, which should match items in the index of the series, but it does not recognize them properly.

The function `_get_with` tries to handle different types of keys, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various index-like objects. However, when dealing with list-like keys, the function fails to interpret them correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys. We should ensure that when a list key is provided, the function correctly locates the corresponding values in the series index. By adjusting the conditional branches that handle different key types, we can resolve the issue and make the function work as expected.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected function, the issue with handling list-like keys in the `Series` class should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test cases.
