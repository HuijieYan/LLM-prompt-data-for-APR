Based on the given information, the bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly in certain cases, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers and that the correct indexing operation is performed based on the input. We should modify the function to handle list indexers properly, preventing the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = [k for k in key if k in self.index]  # Remove keys not present in the index
        if not key:  # If all keys were removed
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are properly handled by checking if the keys are present in the index before indexing, preventing the KeyError issue. Now the `_get_with` function should pass all the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the GitHub issue as well.
