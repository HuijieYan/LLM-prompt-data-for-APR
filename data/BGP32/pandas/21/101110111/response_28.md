After analyzing the buggy function and its interaction with the failing test, it appears that the issue stems from the handling of the key parameter when it is of type list. The current implementation does not treat list indexers the same as array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies in behavior.

To address this issue, the buggy function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. By updating the conditional logic related to the type of key provided, we can ensure that the function behaves consistently and passes the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, list indexers are treated the same as other array-like indexers by using the `loc` method to access the data. This ensures consistency in behavior and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function will properly handle list indexers and pass the failing test cases mentioned above.
