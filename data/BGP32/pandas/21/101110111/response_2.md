To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, we need to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue specifically focuses on the behavior when indexing with a list returning a `KeyError`, while other types of indexers work correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When indexing with a list, the function currently throws a `KeyError` instead of behaving consistently with array-like or `Index` indexers. This inconsistency leads to failing tests, as they expect unified behavior for different types of indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers (list, array-like, `Index`) when indexing in the `_get_with` function.
2. Update the logic to handle list-like indexers similarly to other indexers to align with expected behavior and fix the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle list-like indexers consistently with other types
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, all the failing test cases should pass, and the behavior will be consistent for different types of indexers as expected.
