### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the current implementation is causing issues when using list-like objects as keys in the indexing operation, leading to `KeyError` exceptions.

#### Error Locations:
1. The `is_list_like` check in the `elif` block is not handling list-like keys correctly.
2. The handling of `key` when it's not an instance of `list` or `np.ndarray` is causing issues.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper handling of list-like objects during indexing operations. The function fails to properly process the list-like keys, resulting in `KeyError` exceptions when trying to access non-existent keys.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like keys and ensure that the indexing operation works correctly for all types of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like keys properly and ensuring consistent behavior for all types of keys, we can address the bug and resolve the `KeyError` exceptions encountered during indexing operations.
