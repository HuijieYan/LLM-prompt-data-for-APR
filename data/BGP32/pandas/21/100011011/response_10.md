### Analysis:
1. The `KeyError` is raised during the test because the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the `key` is provided as a list or an array-like object properly.
2. The function checks for various types like `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, etc., but doesn't handle the `Index`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, or `pd.Series` cases correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.
3. The failing tests provide input values where the `key` is an array-like object of string type elements ('C'), and the function proceeds to check the type and apply different logic based on the type, resulting in the key_type being identified as `'string'`.
4. The `key_type` variable should not be 'string' in this scenario, causing incorrect behavior leading to `KeyError`.
5. The function should properly handle the case where the `key` is a list or an array-like object to prevent the `KeyError` during indexing.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, update the function to handle the case where the `key` is provided as an array-like object (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series). This can be achieved by converting the `key` to a list before checking its type and proper handling based on the converted list.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = list(key)  # Convert key to list

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By converting the `key` to a list early in the function, the corrected version ensures that the appropriate logic is applied for array-like objects, preventing the `KeyError` and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
