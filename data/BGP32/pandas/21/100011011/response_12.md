### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of the key and chooses how to handle it accordingly. The bug seems to occur when indexing with a list, where the function fails to handle it correctly and raises a `KeyError`, leading to test failures.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the issue arises when indexing a Series with a list containing values that are not in the Series index. This inconsistency in behavior for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers is highlighted in the GitHub issue description.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation for handling list type key indexing is not consistent with handling other array-like indexers. The function should treat list indexers similar to other array-like indexers, but it fails to do so specifically for lists.

In the failing cases provided, the `key_type` is inferred as `'string'`, indicating a mismatch in handling the list-like key.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs adjustments to handle list type key indexing consistently with other array-like indexers. The function should correctly reindex the Series when the key is of list type and the values are not present in the Series index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Details:
- Added a check to treat non-list-like keys or keys of type Pandas Series to use `loc` directly.
- Moved the inference of `key_type` inside the block for array-like indexers (to handle consistency).
- Ensured that indexing with `pd.Index` is handled correctly for the `key_type`.
- Updated the condition to handle list indexers similar to other array-like indexers.
- Made sure that list indexing behavior is consistent with other array-like indexers.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the function should handle list indexing consistently and resolve the issue when indexing a Series with a list key.
