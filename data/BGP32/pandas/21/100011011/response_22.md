### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object in pandas. The issue arises when a list-like key is passed as an indexer, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency can be seen in the failing test cases, where using a list key does not raise the expected `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The key issue lies in how the function handles list-like keys. The function checks if the key is not list-like and then tries to access the key using the `loc` attribute. This approach fails to properly handle list-like keys, leading to unexpected behavior in some cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and align the behavior of list-like keys with other types of indexers, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys and raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys to maintain consistent behavior
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys and ensuring that they are correctly processed before the function's return, the corrected version should resolve the inconsistency issue highlighted in the failing test cases and align the behavior of list-like keys with other indexers.
