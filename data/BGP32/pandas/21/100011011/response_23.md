## Analysis
The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list-like indexer is used, the function fails to properly process it, leading to a `KeyError`. The function should treat all indexers consistently to avoid this error.

## Error Cause
The main cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers like arrays, Index objects, or Series objects. In the failing test cases, when a list-like indexer is passed, the function encounters a KeyError due to the mismatch in the handling of this specific type of indexer.

## Solution Strategy
To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to treat all types of indexers consistently. This can be achieved by updating the logic to handle list-like indexers in a similar manner to other indexers like arrays, Index objects, or Series objects.

## Revised Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError encountered in the failing test cases.
