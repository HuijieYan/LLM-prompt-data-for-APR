### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle the case when the key is a list properly. When the key is a list, the function tries to convert it to a different data structure, causing a KeyError to be raised instead of returning the expected result. This issue is related to how different types of key indexers are handled inconsistently.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is a list and handle it accordingly without converting it to a different data structure.
2. Ensure that the function returns the correct result for all types of key indexers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index.is_object():
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- The corrected function now properly handles the case when `key` is a list. It checks if the key is list-like and proceeds accordingly without converting it to another data structure.
- It also correctly handles different types of key indexers (list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index) by identifying their types and returning the result accordingly.
- The function now ensures that the appropriate indexing method (iloc or loc) is used based on the type of index and key.
