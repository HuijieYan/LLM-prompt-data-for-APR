### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is not handling the indexing correctly for different types of input `key` such as lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series. The issue arises when a Series is indexed with a list causing a KeyError even though the indexer is existing in the Series. This inconsistency is highlighted in the provided GitHub issue, where different behaviors are observed based on the type of input.

### Bug Location:
The issue in the buggy function lies in the handling of list-like indexers, specifically in the condition where `if not is_list_like(key)`. This condition fails to properly handle list-like objects causing a KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the function `_get_with` incorrectly processes the key if it is not recognized as list-like. The function should handle list indexers more consistently with other indexers to avoid KeyErrors when the key exists in the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are appropriately handled to prevent KeyErrors. This involves updating the conditional checks and behavior for list-like keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Updated condition to handle list-like indexers appropriately
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle list-like indexers correctly, the corrected version ensures that the Series can be indexed consistently regardless of the type of indexer used. This fix should resolve the KeyErrors encountered in the failing tests and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
