### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` when indexing a pandas Series. However, it fails to properly handle the case when `key` is a list.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate a KeyError is raised when trying to access values from the Series with a list-like `key`, such as a list, numpy array, Index, or another Series.
3. The buggy function incorrectly handles the list-like `key`, leading to KeyError exceptions.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle indexing with list-like objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle indexing when `key` is a list. When trying to access values from the Series with a list-like `key`, the current implementation incorrectly raises KeyError exceptions.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling list-like `key` within the `_get_with` function. We need to ensure that list-like `key` is properly processed and used for indexing without raising KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like `key` using `list(key)` and adjusting the subsequent processing, the corrected version should address the bug and allow the function to properly handle indexing with list-like objects.
