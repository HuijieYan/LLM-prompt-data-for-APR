### Analysis:
The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The issue seems to be related to how list-like indexers are handled differently from other types like arrays, Index, and Series. The failing test cases indicate that the KeyError is raised when trying to index a Series using a list-like key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the inconsistent handling of list-like keys compared to other types of keys. It fails to properly handle list indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases, as reported in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like keys. We can modify the logic to handle list indexers in a similar manner to other types of indexers to avoid the KeyError issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like keys along with arrays, Index, and Series
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle the possible dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function to handle list indexers similarly to other types, we ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
