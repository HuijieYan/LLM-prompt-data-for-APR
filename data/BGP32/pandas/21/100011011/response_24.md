### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is passed as a list when indexing a Series. This leads to inconsistencies in behavior depending on the type of indexer used. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, a KeyError is raised because the function is not handling list indexers properly.

### Potential Error Locations:
The issue lies in the block of code where the function checks if the key is not list-like and then proceeds to handle it. The function does not have specific handling for list key types, which results in the KeyError when indexing with a list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function is not correctly handling list keys, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency causes the failing test to raise a KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle list-like keys in the same way as other indexers like ndarray, Index, or Series. We should modify the function to properly process list indexers to avoid raising a KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking if the key is list-like and converting it to a list, we ensure that list indexers are handled properly, resolving the KeyError issue when indexing a Series with a list. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers.
