### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys passed to a Series.
2. The function checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list-like, or other types and determines the appropriate action.
3. The error messages in the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling key types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series correctly.
4. The key_type inferred in the function is 'string' which is incorrect for the provided inputs, leading to wrong actions based on this incorrect inference.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the key type is inferred and handled for different input types.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect inference of key_type as 'string' for various input types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
- This incorrect key_type inference leads to faulty decisions in the logic flow of the function, resulting in KeyError when indexing the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic for inferring the key_type to correctly identify the input types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and handle them accordingly.
- Ensure that the correct actions (loc, iloc, reindex, etc.) are taken based on the type of key passed to the Series.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Updated to correctly check for list-like key
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the key_type inference and handling various input types appropriately, the function should now be able to handle different key types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series correctly, resolving the KeyError issues in the failing tests.
