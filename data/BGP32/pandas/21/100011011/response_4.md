### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers when indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are treated when passed to the function.

1. The error messages from failing tests indicate that the function is not handling certain types of indexers correctly, leading to KeyError exceptions.
2. The function seems to incorrectly handle the condition when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, causing inconsistencies in behavior.
3. The function is failing to return the expected values when dealing with specific types of indexers, leading to test failures.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. This results in inconsistencies in behavior, leading to KeyError exceptions when attempting to index the Series. The function fails to appropriately process these different types of indexers, resulting in incorrect return values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the function `_get_with` to handle different types of indexers consistently and return the expected values accordingly. We should ensure that the function correctly processes list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers without causing KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Other types of indexers
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function `_get_with` with the corrected version as provided above, we aim to address the inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers and ensure that the function returns the expected values without causing KeyError exceptions.
