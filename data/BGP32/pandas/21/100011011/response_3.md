### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue specifically when using a list as the key to index the Series.
3. The key types encountered in the failing test cases are list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
4. In all failing test cases, the function fails to correctly handle indexing with a list key, leading to a KeyError.
5. The root cause seems to be the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other indexers in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the function's inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other types of indexers. When a list is used as the key to index the Series, the function fails to properly handle this case, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers, such as ndarray, Index, and Series. This involves updating the logic for processing list indexers to align with the behavior observed for other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers consistently with other indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other indexers accordingly
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic inside the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, we address the bug reported in the failing test cases. This correction ensures that all types of indexers are processed correctly and consistently within the function.
