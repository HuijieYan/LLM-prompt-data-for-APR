### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that there is an issue when indexing with lists, arrays, indexes, and Series. The key error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" suggests that the function is not correctly handling the indexing operation for lists in the given test cases.

In the provided cases, the `key_type` is always inferred as a string, which indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key when it should be 'object' due to the use of strings. This misidentification could be causing the function to fail in handling the key properly in the subsequent logic.

### Bug Location:
The bug seems to be located in the logic that handles the case for list-like keys. The function should correctly handle the type of the key and perform the indexing operation accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is incorrectly inferring the type of the key as 'string' instead of 'object' in all cases, leading to incorrect handling of the key when indexing the Series. This misidentification is causing the function to return incorrect results or raise errors when indexing with lists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and handles list-like keys appropriately. Specifically, when the key is a list or array, the function should adjust its behavior to properly index the Series without raising errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = 'object'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version of the function, the issue with incorrect key type inference for lists should be resolved, and the function should handle list-like keys properly when indexing the Series. This fix should make the function behave consistently across different types of keys and pass the failing tests.
