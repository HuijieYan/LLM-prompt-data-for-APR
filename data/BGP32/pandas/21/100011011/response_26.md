### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when indexing a Series with different types of indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The behavior is inconsistent, resulting in KeyError exceptions or incorrect behavior. The root cause is the lack of consistent handling for different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Location:
The bug could be in the handling of different types of indexers, specifically in the conditional blocks related to `list` and `Index`, as well as the determination of `key_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when trying to index a Series with different types of indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series because the function `_get_with` does not handle these cases consistently. In the failing tests, the key is not found in the index due to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle different types of indexers uniformly to avoid inconsistencies.
2. Update the logic to appropriately check for list-like objects and handle them consistently.
3. Ensure that indexers like ndarray, Index, and Series are handled correctly without raising KeyError.
4. Refactor the conditional blocks related to `list`, `Index`, and other data types to have consistent behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert Index to list

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series to list to reindex

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series, preventing the KeyError issues observed in the failing tests.
