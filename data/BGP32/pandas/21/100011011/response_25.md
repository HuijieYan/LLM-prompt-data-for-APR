### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the test cases are not raising the expected `KeyError`.
3. The function checks the type of `key` to determine the indexing strategy, but there seems to be an issue with handling certain types of keys.
4. The test cases include different types of keys like lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series.
5. The expected behavior is inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, which is causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected `KeyError` and the actual behavior. This inconsistency is pointed out in the GitHub issue.

### Suggested Fix:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. One approach could be to modify the condition for list-like keys and ensure they are processed correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added an additional condition for handling list-like keys by also considering whether the key is an array-like object. This modification ensures that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers, which should resolve the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub discussion.
