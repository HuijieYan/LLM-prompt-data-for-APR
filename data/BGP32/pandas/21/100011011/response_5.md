## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas.core.series.py` file is causing errors when trying to index a Series with a list, array, Index, or Series that contains values not present in the Series index. The error is raised when attempting to access a key that doesn't match any index values, but the behavior varies depending on the type of indexer used.

The primary issue arises when attempting to index with a list, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to using other types like array, Index, or Series. This inconsistency is highlighted in the provided GitHub issue, where indexing with a list leads to a `KeyError` while indexing with other types returns `NaN`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. In the case of a list indexer, the function directly tries to locate the key in the Series index. If the key is not found, it raises a `KeyError`. However, when other types of indexers are used, the function does not raise an error when the key is not present in the index, resulting in `NaN` values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers. The function should return `NaN` for keys not present in the index, similar to how it behaves when indexing with arrays, Index objects, or Series. Therefore, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like indexers to align with this expected behavior.

## Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    key_in_index = np.in1d(self.index, key)
    if np.any(key_in_index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(key), index=key)

```

This updated version of the function ensures that if the key is not found in the Series index when using list-like indexers, it will return a new Series with `NaN` values corresponding to the non-existent keys. This behavior is consistent with the expected behavior when indexing with other types of objects such as arrays, Index objects, or Series.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
