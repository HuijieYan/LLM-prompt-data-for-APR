### Problem Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for a Series object. However, the bug arises when a key of type list is passed to the function. The function currently does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

1. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling list-like keys properly, resulting in KeyErrors.
2. The key_type variable is incorrectly identified as 'string' in all cases, indicating an issue with inferring the key type.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different indexers (list, array-like) are handled, specifically when indexing a Series object with keys that do not match any values in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling list-like keys when indexing a Series object. When a list-like key is provided, the function fails to reindex correctly, leading to KeyErrors in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys by reindexing the Series object appropriately when a list key is provided. We should aim to make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.) and address the KeyError issues.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we check if the key is list-like using `is_list_like` and convert it to a list if needed. This ensures that list-like keys are handled correctly when indexing the Series object, aiming to resolve the KeyError issues reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
