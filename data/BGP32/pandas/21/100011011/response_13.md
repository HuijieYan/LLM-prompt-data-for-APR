### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalar values, lists, arrays, and more.
2. The error messages from the failing test indicate that there is an issue with indexing using a list type key, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, which might be causing the issue.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that list indexers are treated differently than array-like indexers, which is leading to inconsistency in behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect inference of the key_type as `'string'` for list-like keys, which is not handling them properly during indexing. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to index with a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue:
- Ensure that list-like keys are properly handled without causing a `KeyError`.
- Update the logic to correctly identify the key_type for list-like keys.
- Adjust the indexing logic to handle list-type keys consistently with other array-like keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [{self.index}]")

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]

        elif key_type == "list":
            return self.loc[key]  # Adjust to handle list-like keys

        return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing")

```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check for scalar values in keys that are not in the index, raising a `KeyError` in that case.
2. Adjusted the logic to handle list-like keys by using `self.loc[key]` for them.
3. Updated the logic to handle all types of keys consistently and cover more cases.

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the function should now handle list-like keys appropriately and pass the failing test cases while resolving the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
