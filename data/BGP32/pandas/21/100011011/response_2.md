### Bug Analysis:
The `key` parameter in the function `_get_with` is expected to be an indexer for a Series object. However, the function is checking for various types of indexers but not handling the case where the `key` is a list-like object properly. This is causing the KeyError in the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function not correctly handling list-like indexer objects. When the `key` parameter is a list-like object, the function should treat it as expected for indexing operations on a Series. This issue was identified in a GitHub issue where the behavior for list indexers was inconsistent compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` parameter is a list-like object, the function handles it correctly for indexing. Specifically, the function should treat list-like indexers consistently with other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like indexing consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the function now properly handles list-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across various types of indices. This fix should resolve the KeyError reported in the failing tests and align the function's behavior with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
