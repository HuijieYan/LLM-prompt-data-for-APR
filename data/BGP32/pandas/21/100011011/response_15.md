### Bug Analysis
The `__getitem__` method is raising a `KeyError` when using a list as an indexer, while it behaves differently for other types like array-like indexers. This inconsistency originates from the `_get_with` method in the `pandas/core/series.py` file, which lacks proper handling for list-like indexers.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring in the section where the function checks for list-like indexers and attempts to handle them. The issue arises due to the incompatible handling of lists compared to other types like arrays or indexes.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in how list-like indexers are processed within the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is encountered, it does not follow the same path as other valid indexer types, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existing values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other valid indexers. This can be achieved by properly processing list indexers within the `_get_with` function to prevent `KeyError` when accessing non-existing values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not is_object_dtype(key):
        # handle list-like indexers
        key = list(key)
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # rest of the function follows

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function properly handles list-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior with other valid indexers. It resolves the issue of `KeyError` when using lists as indexers and aligns the processing logic for various types of indexers within the function.
