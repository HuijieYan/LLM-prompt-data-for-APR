### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different key types for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the bug occurs when using a list indexer. The error message points to a KeyError due to None of \[Index\(\['C'\], dtype='object'\)\] being in the \[index\].
3. Based on the provided runtime values, the variable `key_type` is being set incorrectly to 'string' when the key is a list, leading to the incorrect behavior.
4. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect identification of the key type when it is a list, which leads to the failure in indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly setting the `key_type` variable to 'string' when the key is a list. This leads to incorrect behavior in determining how the indexing operation should be handled.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should correctly determine the key type for a list input and handle it appropriately to ensure the indexing operation is performed correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Corrected key type handling for lists
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` for lists input, we ensure that the key is correctly converted to an Index type before further processing, fixing the bug related to incorrect key type identification. This corrected version should handle list indexers correctly and pass the failing test.
