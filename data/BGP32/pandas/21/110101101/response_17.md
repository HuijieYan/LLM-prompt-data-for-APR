### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when handling key values of type `list`, `ndarray`, or `Index`. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of the key type and decision-making between positional indexing and label-based indexing. The bug results in a KeyError when attempting to access an item that is not present in the index.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is primarily caused by incorrect inference of the `key_type` variable as `'string'` instead of the expected types such as `'integer'` or `'object'`. This incorrect inference leads to incorrect indexing decisions based on the key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is inferred correctly and then make appropriate decisions based on this type. Specifically, for keys that are not recognized as index types, we should default to using label-based indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_arr = np.asarray(key)

    if is_integer(key_arr):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_bool(key_arr):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the corrections as outlined above, the function will now correctly handle key types `list`, `ndarray`, and `Index`, and provide the expected behavior in line with the failing test cases.
