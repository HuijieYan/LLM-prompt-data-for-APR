### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values based on different types of keys. However, in the current implementation, the logic to handle non-list-like keys is causing an issue. When the key is not a list-like object, the function is trying to access the value using the `loc` method, which results in a KeyError because the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that handling of non-list-like keys is done correctly. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should handle different types of keys appropriately to avoid KeyErrors.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if not is_scalar(key):
            key = [key]
        else:
            key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the handling of non-list-like keys and ensuring that scalars are converted to a list before accessing `self.loc`, the corrected function should now handle different key types without causing exceptions.
