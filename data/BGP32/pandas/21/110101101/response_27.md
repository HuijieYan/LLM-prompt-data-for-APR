The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by incorrectly identifying the type of the `key` parameter. In some cases, the function incorrectly identifies the key type as 'string' instead of 'object', leading to the wrong behavior and failing the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified as 'object' when necessary. We can achieve this by modifying the logic to check for different key types more accurately and handle them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of incorrectly identifying the key type as 'string' by properly differentiating between different key types and handling them accordingly.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
