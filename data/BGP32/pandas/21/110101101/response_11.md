### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key input, specifically when the key is not recognized as a list-like structure. This leads to an incorrect determination of the `key_type`, resulting in the function returning the wrong values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key input is properly handled in all cases. We should correctly determine the `key_type` based on the key input and then choose the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        indexer = key
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        indexer = key._values
    else:
        raise TypeError("Key type not supported")

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(indexer, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added handling for the case when the key is not list-like by converting it into a list.
2. Improved the mechanism to determine the key type by first checking if the key is an Index, a list, a numpy array, or an ExtensionArray. If it's a Series, we use its values.
3. Added a check to ensure that the key input is of a supported type, raising an error if it is not recognized.
4. Updated the logic for indexing based on the key_type to choose between `loc` and `iloc` based on the key_type.
5. Replaced the ambiguity in the key variable with `indexer` to avoid confusion with different types of objects with similar names.
