## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the key is a scalar value correctly. The function tries to determine the type of the key and perform operations based on that type. However, in the case of a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`, the function mistakenly tries to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]`, which leads to a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to first identify when the key is a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. In such cases, we should return the correct value using `self.loc[key]` to handle scalars properly.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including `if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series))`, we cover the case where the key is a scalar that is not recognized as list-like, and correctly handle it by accessing the value using `self.loc[key]`. This fix ensures that scalars are handled properly in the function, resolving the bug.
