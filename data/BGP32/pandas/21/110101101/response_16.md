### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an instance of any of the specified types (`list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index`). In such cases, the function tries to treat the `key` as a scalar index for location-based indexing (`self.loc[key]`). This leads to a `KeyError` since the `key` is not present in the index of the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an instance of the specified types. Instead of trying location-based indexing directly, we should raise an exception or return a meaningful error message indicating that the key is not present in the index.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### With this corrected code, the function will now raise a `KeyError` with a meaningful error message if the key is not found in the index, ensuring that the function handles all cases properly.
