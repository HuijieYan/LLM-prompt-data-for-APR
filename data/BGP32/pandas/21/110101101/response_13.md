### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` variable when it is not recognized as a list-like object. This leads to an incorrect path being taken within the function, resulting in unexpected behavior.

1. When `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]` directly, assuming that `key` is a valid index. This can lead to a `KeyError` if `key` is not present in the index.
2. The function fails to handle cases where `key` is not a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index properly, leading to potential errors in inference of the `key_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all possible types of inputs for `key` properly and routes the execution flow accordingly. We should also improve the detection of the `key_type` to ensure correct indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes in the `_get_with` function, we ensure proper handling of different types of `key` inputs and correct inference of the `key_type`. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing tests.
