### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys when indexing a Series. However, there are multiple issues in the function that lead to incorrect behavior. In particular, when key is not a list-like object, the function tries to index using `self.loc[key]`, which causes a KeyError to be raised when `key` is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle different types of keys appropriately. Specifically, we should not directly index with `self.loc[key]` when `key` is not a list-like object. Instead, we should check the key type and then determine the appropriate indexing method (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) based on the key type.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made
1. Added a check to convert `key` to a list if it is not already list-like.
2. Updated the key type inference logic to handle cases where `key` is not list-like.
3. Made sure to handle the key type correctly when deciding between positional or label-based indexing.
4. Removed the direct indexing with `self.loc[key]` when `key` is not a list-like object.
