## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when trying to handle indexers of type `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` in a specific way based on their type. When the key is not recognized as list-like, the function attempts to access the index using `self.loc[key]`, assuming the key is a valid index. However, this causes a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not found in the index to prevent the KeyError. One approach is to validate the key against the index before attempting to access it. If the key is not found in the index, we should raise a KeyError.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.isin(self.index).all():
        key = self.index.get_indexer(key)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index.")
```

By using the `isin` method with `self.index`, we can check if all elements of `key` are present in the index. If so, we proceed with the indexing as before. If not, we raise a KeyError with an appropriate message indicating the missing values. This correction ensures that the function behaves correctly even when the key is not found in the index.
