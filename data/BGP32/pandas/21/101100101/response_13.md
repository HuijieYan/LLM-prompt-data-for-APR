### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be in the logic for handling non-list-like and non-Index objects when indexing the Series.

The bug arises from the mishandling of non-list-like and non-Index objects. When the key is not list-like, the function tries to use `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors, as shown in the failing test. This issue results from incorrect assumptions about the type of the key and how it should be treated.

### Bug:
The bug is in the logic for handling non-list-like and non-Index objects in the `_get_with` function. The check for `not is_list_like(key)` is inadequate for determining how to handle the key when it is not list-like.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for handling non-list-like and non-Index objects. A strategy for a fix is to properly distinguish between different types of keys and use the appropriate indexing method (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) based on the key's properties.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to properly differentiate between different key types and using the appropriate indexing method, the corrected version of the function should now handle all cases correctly and pass the failing test.
