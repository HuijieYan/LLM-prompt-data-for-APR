## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys and return the appropriate result based on the type. However, there seems to be an issue with the conditional checks and the branching logic. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object, resulting in an incorrect branch being taken and leading to an error.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue arises when the key is a list-like object. The current conditional logic checks if the key is not list-like, and if it is, further checks are made. However, the logic for handling list-like keys is faulty. It incorrectly assumes that if the key is not list-like, it must be a scalar, but this is not the case.

In the failing test, the key is a Series object converted into a list-like object using various types (`list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series`). This triggers the problematic conditional logic in the buggy function, leading to an incorrect branch being taken and causing a KeyError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to restructure the conditional checks to handle list-like keys properly. We should check if the key is an iterable object but not an instance of Index, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or list. In such cases, we can treat it as a scalar or positional indexer. By making this adjustment, we can ensure that list-like objects are correctly handled in the function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check for list-like key
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, list)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles list-like keys and distinguishes them from scalars. This updated version should pass the failing test cases and correctly handle various key types according to the desired logic.
