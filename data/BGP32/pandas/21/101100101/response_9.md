The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the key is a list-like object that is not recognized by the `is_list_like` function, causing it to fall into the `elif not is_list_like(key)` block. In this block, the function attempts to access `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case of non-list-like keys before attempting to access `self.loc[key]`. We can check if the key is an instance of `Index` and handle it separately. If the key is any other type, we can convert it to a list and then check the inferred data type to decide whether to use label-based indexing with `self.loc` or positional indexing with `self.iloc`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles non-list-like keys, checks for the inferred data type, and performs the indexing accordingly. This should resolve the `KeyError` issue when accessing `self.loc[key]` with non-list-like keys.
