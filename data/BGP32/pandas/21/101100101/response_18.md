## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by mishandling of the key types. The function doesn't correctly identify the key type, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and raising errors in certain cases where the key is not recognized properly.

In the failing test case, the key provided to the `_get_with` function is of type `np.array` (`ndarray`), while the function assumes its type to be a list. This mismatch leads to the function not properly identifying the key type as `'string'` in the case of an ndarray, causing the function to return incorrect results or raise errors.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the key type is properly recognized and handled for different types of inputs. By correctly identifying the key type and processing it according to its type, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of keys.

## Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key)
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of keys, ensuring proper indexing behavior and no errors for the failing test case.
