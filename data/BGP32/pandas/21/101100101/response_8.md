## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys to retrieve values from a Series. However, in the cases where the key is a list-like object (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`), it fails to correctly retrieve the values from the Series. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys and the conversion to appropriate indexes for retrieval.

The bug arises from incorrectly handling the different types of key inputs, leading to errors in retrieving the values from the Series.

## Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to incorrectly attempt to handle list-like keys, leading to a failure in retrieving the desired values. The issue specifically arises when dealing with list-like keys (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) which are not being correctly handled for indexing the Series.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly for indexing the Series. Specifically, we need to handle cases where the key can be converted into the appropriate index type for retrieval (label-based or positional).

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as above, the bug related to handling list-like keys for indexing the Series should be fixed, and the function should now be able to correctly retrieve values from the Series with list-like keys.
