### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of input `key` values and return the corresponding values based on the type. However, there is an issue in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is not recognized as one of the expected types.

### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to arise in the block of code where the type of `key` is checked, and if it does not match any of the expected types, the function tries to convert it to a list.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function receives an input `key` that is not recognized as one of the expected types (`slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`). In this case, the function tries to convert `key` to a list using `list(key)`. However, if `key` is already a `Series` object, this conversion does not work correctly and leads to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of the `key` parameter when it is not recognized as one of the expected types. Instead of converting `key` to a list directly, we should check if it is a `Series` object and handle it appropriately.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By adding a new condition to check if the `key` is an instance of `Series`, we can handle it appropriately without the need for conversion. This ensures that the function works correctly for all expected types of input keys.
