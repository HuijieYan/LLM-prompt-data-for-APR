### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is an issue with the logic for identifying the type of key and determining the appropriate action.

1. When the key is not list-like or a scalar, the function incorrectly tries to use `self.loc[key]` which can lead to a KeyError.
2. The logic for handling different key types is not consistent and can lead to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the key is not list-like or a scalar. In this case, the function mistakenly tries to use `self.loc[key]` which is incorrect and can result in a KeyError. This issue arises due to inconsistent handling of different key types within the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and selects the appropriate method for indexing. We should also ensure that the behavior is consistent across different key types to prevent errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.inferred_type == "boolean":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we use `ensure_index` to convert the key to an Index type, which ensures consistent handling across different key types. We also check the inferred type of the key to determine the appropriate indexing method (loc, iloc, or reindex) to prevent KeyError issues. This updated logic should address the bug and pass the failing test cases.
