### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing in a Series object. The bug lies in the incorrect handling of a key that is a list-like object that is not recognized as one of the specified types (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, `Index`). In this case, the function tries to convert the key to a list, but then incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'`.

### Bug Explanation
When the key is a list-like object that is not one of the specified types, the function incorrectly assumes the `key` is a string, leading to an incorrect branch in the code. This results in an incorrect selection in the indexing operation, leading to the `KeyError` in the test case.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key when it is list-like but not recognized as one of the specified types. We should treat such keys as lists to maintain consistency. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the key is not recognized and reindex the Series with the key.

### Corrected Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)  # Treat as a list of keys

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle list-like keys properly by treating them as lists and avoid the incorrect assumption of the key type as `'string'`.
