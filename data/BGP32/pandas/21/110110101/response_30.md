## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key when it is an array-like object.
3. The failing test case is trying to index a Series with a key that is not present in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the bug in the `_get_with` function prevents this behavior.
4. The bug occurs when the key is converted to a list and the key type is inferred as `'string'`.
5. The bug can be fixed by updating the condition for handling string keys in the function.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):        
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a condition to handle `'string'` keys specifically and returning `self.loc[key]` in that case, we can fix the bug and ensure that the correct behavior is observed when indexing a Series with a key not present in the index.
