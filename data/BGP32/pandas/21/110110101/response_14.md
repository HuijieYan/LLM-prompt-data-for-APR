### Correction:

Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when handling different types of keys. The function is not correctly determining the key type, which leads to incorrect behavior in the subsequent conditional branches.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for determining the key type and handling each type accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = 'label'  # Treat all collections as label-based indexing
    else:
        key_type = 'scalar'  # Assume scalar keys are label-based

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that different types of keys are correctly handled, and the key type is accurately determined before proceeding with the appropriate indexing method.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected input/output values.
