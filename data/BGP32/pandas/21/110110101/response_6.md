### Buggy Function Analysis
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing the Series object. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the different types of key inputs, particularly when the key is not recognized as a list-like object.

### Bug Identification
The bug seems to occur when the key input is not recognized as a list-like object, as seen in the line `elif not is_list_like(key):`. In this case, the function attempts to access the `loc` attribute of the Series object with the key as an index, which results in a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test is attempting to index a Series object with a key that is not recognized as list-like (e.g., a single value Series object). The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` instead of handling such cases properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the `_get_with` function when the key is not recognized as list-like. Instead of directly accessing the `loc` attribute with the key, we should return the reindexed Series based on the key.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex([key])

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the line `return self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys to `return self.reindex([key])`, we ensure that the Series object is correctly reindexed based on the key, avoiding the `KeyError` raised in the failing test.
