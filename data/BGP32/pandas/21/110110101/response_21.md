### Buggy function analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexing operations on a pandas Series object. However, the current implementation has a bug in handling the `key` input parameter, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases.

### Identified bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when handling non-unique values in the index of the Series. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` instead of `'object'` when encountering a non-unique key that is not recognized as a list-like object.

### Bug cause:
When the function encounters a non-unique key that is not recognized as a list-like object, it attempts to perform indexing using `self.loc[key]`. This leads to a `KeyError` since the key is not recognized as a valid index.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling non-unique keys and ensure that the key is correctly recognized and handled based on its type. Specifically, we need to identify non-unique keys and properly reindex the Series to avoid the `KeyError` exception.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif key_type == "object":
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError("KeyError: Key not found in index")
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected `_get_with` function should properly handle non-unique keys and avoid the `KeyError` issue when performing indexing operations on the Series object.
