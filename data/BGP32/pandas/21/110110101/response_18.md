### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library. It is responsible for handling different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list_like) for indexing a Series.
2. The error occurs when the function encounters a key that is an array-like object (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and tries to convert it into a list. This conversion causes the issue.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` creates a Series object with values `["A", "B"]` and then tries to index it with a key that is not present in the index. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError with a specific message.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of array-like keys differently, ensuring proper type checking and indexing methods based on the type of the key.
 
### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when an array-like key (list, ndarray, Index, Series) is encountered. The function tries to convert the key into a list regardless of its type. This causes unexpected behavior when indexing the Series subsequently.
In the failing test, the key is a Series object `key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)` which is then converted to `box(key)` where `box` is a class type (`pd.Index` in this case). The bug triggers during the conversion of `key` to a list, leading to the test failure where the expected KeyError is not raised.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle array-like keys differently based on their types. We can check the type of the key and perform indexing accordingly. For instance, if the key is a Series object, we should directly use `self.loc[key]` instead of converting it to a list.
We should also ensure that the correct error is raised when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for array-like keys and handle them accordingly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle array-like keys based on their types
    if isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should handle array-like keys appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
