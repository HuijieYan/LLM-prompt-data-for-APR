### Correction strategy
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, which leads to an incorrect handling of the key. To fix this bug, we need to properly handle non-list-like keys to avoid the KeyError.

To correct this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling non-list-like keys and ensure that the key is appropriately processed based on its type before proceeding with the rest of the function.

### Correction of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments above, the corrected function should handle non-list-like keys appropriately and avoid raising a KeyError during the test execution.
