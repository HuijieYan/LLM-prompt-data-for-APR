### Bug Analysis
The bug is in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When the function receives a key that is a Series object, the function fails to handle it correctly and raises a `KeyError` instead of processing the key properly.

In the failing test, the key is created using a Series object and then passed to the `ser[key]` operation. The expected behavior is that the function should handle this key as a list-like object and return the appropriate output. However, due to the bug, the function raises a KeyError instead of processing the key correctly.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle all possible types of keys that can be passed to it, specifically when the key is a Series object. The function expects the key to be either a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, but does not handle a Series object specifically.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to update the conditional statements to properly handle the case when the key is a Series object. We should treat a Series object similar to a list-like object by extracting the values from the Series and performing the necessary operations.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = key.values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes to the `_get_with` function, the function should now properly handle the case where the key is a Series object and return the expected output, passing the failing test cases.
