## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is trying to handle different types of input `key` such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, Series, Index, etc. The bug is occurring when the input key is converted to a list, and the subsequent checks are not handling the converted list correctly.

The failing test is trying to index a `Series` using an index key that does not exist in the series. However, the buggy function is not handling this case properly, leading to a `KeyError`, which results in the test failure.

The expected type of the `key_type` variable before returning should be `'string'`, but the buggy function is not correctly handling the case where the key is converted to a list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to make sure that the key is properly handled when it is converted to a list. We should also ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and processed based on the key_type value.

The bug can be resolved by specifically checking the type of the key after conversion to a list and then reindexing the series accordingly. We will update the logic to handle a list-like key appropriately and return the correct result without causing a `KeyError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        if not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles the case when the `key` input is converted to a list and correctly processes the list-like key for reindexing the series without causing a `KeyError`.
