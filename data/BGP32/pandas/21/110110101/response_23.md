## Bug Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object and the function incorrectly assumes that the key is a scalar.
3. The buggy code checks if the key is not list-like, it attempts to index the Series using `self.loc[key]`. This assumption is incorrect for list-like keys.
4. The failing test is trying to index the Series with a key that is a list-like object, causing a KeyError since the key is not found in the index.
5. The key_type determination in the buggy code is incorrect and does not handle list-like keys properly.

## Fix Strategy
1. Update the key_type determination to correctly handle list-like keys.
2. Modify the flow of the function to differentiate between list-like and non-list-like keys.
3. Use the appropriate indexing method based on the type of key.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    # Check for non-list-like keys
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying the provided fix, the `_get_with` function will now handle list-like keys correctly and index the Series appropriately, passing the failing test cases and satisfying the expected input/output values.
