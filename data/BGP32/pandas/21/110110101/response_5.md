### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys passed to a `Series` object. The function checks the type of the key and performs different operations accordingly.
2. The function encounters an issue when dealing with a key that is an instance of `Index` or `Series`, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access a non-existing index value.
3. The failing test is designed to pass different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to a `Series` object and expects a KeyError to be raised when the key is not found in the index.
4. The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case when the key is an instance of `Index` or `Series`. The current implementation tries to access the key directly from the `loc` attribute, resulting in a KeyError if the key does not exist in the index.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle keys that are instances of `Index` or `Series` appropriately by reindexing them.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the key is an instance of `Index` or `Series`.
2. If the key is an instance of `Index` or `Series`, reindex it with the original `index`.
3. If the key is a single-value key that does not exist in the index, raise a KeyError as expected.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By reindexing the key when it is an instance of `Index` or `Series`, we ensure that the key is aligned with the original index of the `Series` object. This fix addresses the KeyError issue when accessing keys that are not present in the index.
