### Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function is responsible for handling different types of keys to retrieve values from the Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different key types, specifically when the key is a list or ndarray containing one element.
3. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when providing a key that does not exist in the Series.
4. The bug occurs when attempting to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]`. In this case, when `key` is represented as a list or ndarray with one element, it is incorrectly treated as a label-based index instead of a positional index.
   
### Bug Cause
When the key is a list or ndarray with one element, the buggy function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'` due to the presence of only one element. This leads to the key being treated as a label-based index inappropriately, ultimately resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy
We need to modify the logic for inferring the key type in the `_get_with` function to handle the case of a list or ndarray containing only one element correctly. By checking the length of the key, we can determine whether it should be treated as a positional or label-based index. 

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer" and len(key) == 1:  # Handle single-element positional key
        return self.iloc[key[0]]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a check to handle single-element positional keys correctly before proceeding with the inference of the key type. Now, the function should correctly handle the case where a key is provided as a list or ndarray with one element.
