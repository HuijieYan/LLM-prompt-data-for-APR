## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of keys provided to the function. In the failing test, the function is called with a key that is converted to an ndarray, and the function fails to correctly handle this case. 

The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is converted to an ndarray in the test function and passed to the `_get_with` function. The `_get_with` function does not handle this case properly and tries to infer the type of the key. However, the condition to handle lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects is not correctly implemented, leading to a KeyError being raised.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the different types of keys passed to the function are correctly handled. We need to update the conditional statements to properly handle the various types of keys such as lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif np.isscalar(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        # handle the case of a non-recognizable key (e.g., Scalar)
        return self.loc[key]
```

By adding a condition to handle all types of keys, including scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly for all input types. This fix should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
