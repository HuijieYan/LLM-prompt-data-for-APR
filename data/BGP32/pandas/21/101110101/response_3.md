To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case where the key is a list or ndarray. The current implementation does not handle these types correctly, leading to KeyError when trying to access the Series data with a key of list or ndarray type.

The key issue lies in the following block of code inside the `_get_with` function:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```
This block mistakenly converts the key into a list regardless of its original type, causing incorrect indexing behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the key differently based on its type. If the key is a list or ndarray, we should directly return the result of `self.loc[key]` without converting it to a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly handle list and ndarray keys, preventing the KeyError that occurred in the failing test cases.

The corrected function ensures that the input key is not modified unnecessarily and correctly returns the indexed values based on the key type.
