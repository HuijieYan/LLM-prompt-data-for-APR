## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of the `key` parameter when it is not a list-like object. When `key` is not list-like, the function tries to access the `key` using `self.loc[key]`. This causes an issue when `key` is a Series object (e.g., `pd.Series(["C"], dtype=object)`) wrapped in different containers like list, ndarray, or Index, as the indexing operation attempts to access the Series as if it were a single value rather than individual elements.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is a Series object wrapped in other container types correctly. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]` in such cases, we should iterate over the elements of the Series and access them individually.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    for k in key:
        if not isinstance(k, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, Index)):
            k = [k]
    
        if isinstance(k, pd.Index):
            key_type = k.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(k, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[k]
            else:
                return self.iloc[k]
    
        if isinstance(k, list):
            return self.loc[k]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles the case when `key` is a Series object wrapped in various container types, ensuring that the individual elements of the Series are accessed appropriately for indexing. This fix should address the issue observed in the failing test cases.
