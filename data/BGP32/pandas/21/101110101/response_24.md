Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the incorrect handling of key types, specifically when the key is a list-like object such as a numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The function fails to properly process these input types, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access values from the series.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can correctly handle list-like key input types by converting them to a list before further processing. Additionally, we need to update the logic to handle these key types appropriately to prevent the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list-like object
    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like key types
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are properly converted to a list, and the logic for handling different key types is updated to prevent KeyError. The function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values provided.
