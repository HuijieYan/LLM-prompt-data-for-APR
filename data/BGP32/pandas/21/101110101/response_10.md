## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs and perform the appropriate action based on the type of key. However, in the failing test case, when the input key is converted to a different type (list, ndarray, Index, Series), the function fails to handle it correctly and raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected output.

The issue lies in the following part of the code:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
The condition `not is_list_like(key)` checks if the key is not list-like but it fails to handle the case where `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the type of the key to properly handle the cases where the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. We should treat these cases appropriately based on their types.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            # Key is boolean, handle it separately
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the condition to check for the desired types `Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series`, we ensure that the function handles these cases appropriately. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
