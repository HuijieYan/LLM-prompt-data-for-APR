## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when handling the `key` parameter that is not recognized as a list-like object. In this case, the function attempts to access the `key` directly using `self.loc[key]`. However, due to the type of `key` being different from an acceptable type (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), this results in a KeyError when trying to access an index that does not exist in the Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the `key` parameter is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an acceptable type. Instead of directly accessing the value with `self.loc[key]`, we can modify the code to raise a TypeError indicating that the provided key type is not supported for indexing.

## The Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise TypeError(f"Indexing a Series with {type(key)} is not supported")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, when an unsupported type of `key` is provided, the function will raise a TypeError indicating that indexing with that type is not supported. This will prevent the KeyError that was previously occurring due to improper handling of the key parameter.
