## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, in the current implementation, there are issues with how different types of keys are being handled. The bug arises when the key is not recognized as a list-like object and is instead treated as a scalar.

### Cause of the Bug
1. When the key is not recognized as list-like, the function directly tries to index using `self.loc[key]`.
2. In the failing test case, the key is an array of values, which is not recognized as list-like, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case where the key is not recognized as list-like. We can modify the conditional checks to ensure proper handling of keys that are not list-like but still require indexing.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_iterator(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles scalar or non-list-like keys by using `is_scalar` and `is_iterator` checks. This fix ensures that keys like arrays or single values are correctly processed for indexing the Series.
