## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the `_get_with` function when handling the different types of keys passed to it. For the failing tests, the key types are list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The function fails to handle these types properly, leading to a `KeyError` instead of the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle these key types according to the expected behavior in the failing test cases. We will introduce conditional statements to handle each key type appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
  
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
  
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
  
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
  
    if is_object_dtype(key):
        key_type = 'string'  # Explicitly handle string type as well
  
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
  
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
  
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
  
    # Handle other key types appropriately
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        return self.loc[key[0]]
  
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle the different key types passed to it, including list, ndarray, Index, and Series. This correction aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test cases provided.

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests and return the expected results without raising a `KeyError` exception.
