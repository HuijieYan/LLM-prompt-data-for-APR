## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing when the key is passed as a `list`, `np.array`, `Index`, or `Series`. It is not handling these cases properly as it should be able to index using those data types. The failing test is mocking such a scenario where the key to index is a `Series` converted to different types like `list`, `np.array`, `Index`, and `Series`.

## Error Location:
The error lies in the last part of the bug code, where it tries to handle different types of keys. The `elif not is_list_like(key)` condition is blocking lists from being processed correctly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the code is incorrectly checking if the key is list-like. It is using a restrictive condition which is causing it to fail for cases where the key is a list, np.array, Index, or Series.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the restrictive condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` and properly handle list-like types. We should ensure that proper indexing is done based on the key type.

## Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that will pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Convert Series key to list
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By handling `Series` keys correctly and converting them into lists, this corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
