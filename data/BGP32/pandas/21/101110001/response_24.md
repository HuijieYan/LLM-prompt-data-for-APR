### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module accepts a `key` parameter and tries to index a `Series` object based on the type of `key`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file aims to test the behavior when attempting to access a non-existent index from a `Series`.
3. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the `Series`.
4. The error message indicates that the test failed because the `KeyError` was not raised when it was expected.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The section that handles non-list-like `key` types could be causing the issue as it tries to use `loc` for scalar values.
2. The conditional checks for the type of `key` might not be handling all possible types correctly, leading to incorrect indexing.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function fails to raise a `KeyError` when trying to index a `Series` using a key that does not exist in the index. This behavior is incorrectly handled within the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the function correctly raises a `KeyError` when attempting to access keys that don't exist in the index.
2. Revise the conditional checks to handle different types of `key` values appropriately.
3. Make sure that all cases are covered to correctly determine the indexing strategy (e.g., using `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type).

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in the index")

    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made
1. Added a condition to raise a `KeyError` when a non-list-like `key` is given.
2. Updated the handling of different key types to prevent errors and ensure correct indexing.
3. Added a specific error message when a key is not found in the index.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test by correctly handling key indexing and raising a `KeyError` when necessary.
