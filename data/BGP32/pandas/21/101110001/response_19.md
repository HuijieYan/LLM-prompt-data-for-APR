### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The issue occurs when trying to handle different types of keys, specifically when `key` is a list-like object. The conditional flow within the function does not correctly address the case when `key` is a list.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is that the conditional checks inside the `_get_with` function do not handle the case when `key` is a list-like object correctly. When `key` is a list, the function should use `loc` indexing to retrieve elements from the `Series`. However, the bug causes an exception because the logic to handle list-like keys is not implemented correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check to correctly handle list-like objects. When `key` is a list, we should use `loc` indexing to return the values based on the keys in the list.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

By correcting the logic to handle list-like keys, the updated `_get_with` function will pass the provided failing test cases.
