### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the scenario where the key passed is a list or ndarray, causing an error in the test where a key is constructed as a list and then used to access the series. The function branches that try to handle list, ndarray, and Index types as keys are not correctly designed.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case when the key is a list or ndarray in the specified condition checks. This leads to incorrect processing and a KeyError being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the function correctly processes the key when it is a list or ndarray, by updating the conditional logic for handling these cases. By explicitly checking for these types of keys and performing the appropriate operations, we can prevent the KeyError from being raised.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if the key is a list or ndarray
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that the function correctly handles the case when the key is a list or ndarray, preventing the KeyError from being raised in the failing test case.
