### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, Series, and Index objects. It determines the type of indexer and performs specific operations based on that type. However, the bug causes an issue with handling `key` when it is not list-like. 

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing this situation by passing a key that is not present in the index. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError`, but the buggy function is failing to handle this case correctly.

### Bug location:
The bug happens in the case where `key` is not list-like and is not recognized as a valid type. In this situation, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which results in incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because when `key` is not list-like, the function incorrectly handles it by directly accessing `self.loc[key]`. This causes the function to behave unexpectedly and not raise the `KeyError` as expected.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where `key` is not list-like and raises a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key {key} not found in index")
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After making the above changes, run the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` to ensure that the corrected function behaves as expected and raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.
