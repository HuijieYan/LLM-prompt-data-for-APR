### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is meant to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test is trying to index the Series object with a key that does not exist in the Series, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The bug occurs when the input key is a list, array, Index, or Series, as it leads to unexpected behavior, resulting in the failure of the test with a `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>` message.
4. The bug happens when checking the key type and deciding how to handle it based on its type. The current implementation does not correctly handle all the different types of keys specified in the failing test.
5. To fix the bug, we need to make sure all types of keys (list, array, Index, Series) are handled properly and raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the Series.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the pandas library:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}'")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]

    key = self._convert_for_reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the conditional checks, handling all types of keys correctly, and raising a `KeyError` for keys that don't exist in the Series, the bug should be fixed.
