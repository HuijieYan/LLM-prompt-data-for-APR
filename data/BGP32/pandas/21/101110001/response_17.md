### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The failing test case is trying to use a key of type `pd.Series` to index a Series object. The key is not present in the index, which should raise a `KeyError`, but the function fails to do so.

The buggy function first checks if the key is a list-like object. If it is not a list-like object, it tries to perform `.loc[key]`. Instead of raising a `KeyError` when the key is not in the index, it performs an incorrect operation.

### Bug Location:
The bug is present in the following line of code:
```python
return self.loc[key]
```

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when the key is not present in the index, and `_get_with` tries to perform `self.loc[key]`, it should raise a `KeyError` instead of trying to return a non-existent value.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index rather than returning an invalid value.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # branch key type checking logic into __getitem__
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index.")

    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the function to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index, the failing test case should now pass.
