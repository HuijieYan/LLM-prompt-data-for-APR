### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` does not handle the case where the key is of type `list`. Instead of treating it as like, it should be considered as a list-like key and handled accordingly. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements using keys that are lists, causing the related tests to fail.

### Bug Location:
The bug can be located where the function is handling the key if it's not a list-like object.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle lists as expected. It tries to access elements using `loc` but fails to find the keys resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle list-like objects properly in the `_get_with` function. It should first check if the key is either list-like (including arrays) or an `Index` object, and then act accordingly with a call to `loc` or `iloc` based on the inferred key type.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "boolean":
            raise ValueError("Boolean keys are not supported.")
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to appropriately handle list-like objects, the bug should be resolved and the related tests should pass.
