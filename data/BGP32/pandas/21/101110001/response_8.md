### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`. The current implementation does not correctly convert these types of keys to valid formats for indexing the `Series` object.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely arises when the key is not a scalar or an individual element but rather a list-like object. The current implementation fails to properly index the `Series` object when the key is a list, array, or similar collection.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incomplete handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list or another iterable, the function does not convert it into a valid index for indexing a `Series` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle different key types appropriately within the `_get_with` function. This involves converting list-like keys into valid index formats for indexing the `Series` object. We need to account for various key types and ensure that they are compatible with the indexing mechanisms of a `Series` object.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes proper handling for different key types such as lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects. It ensures that these key types are converted to compatible indexing formats before accessing elements from the `Series` object. This correction addresses the bug related to indexing with list-like objects and should resolve the failing test cases.
