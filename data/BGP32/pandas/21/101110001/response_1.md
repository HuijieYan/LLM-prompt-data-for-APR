### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in Pandas. This function is supposed to handle indexing operations based on the type of key provided. 

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to test the behavior when an index key is used with a Series object that does not contain that key. The scenario in the test involves passing various types of keys to the `Series` object and expecting a `KeyError` to be raised if the key is not present in the series.

The primary issue is that the current implementation of `_get_with` does not handle the case where the key is an array-like object, such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. This is causing the test to fail because the exception is not being raised as expected when trying to access a key that does not exist in the series.

### Bug Location and Cause

The bug is located in the section of the function where it checks if the key is not list-like. Since the key provided in the failing test is a Series object (box), it falls into this condition. However, the function is currently not handling the Series object correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly handles different types of array-like objects passed as keys. We need to check for a Series object and properly handle it to avoid the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling `is_list_like(key)` and `ensure_index(key)`, we ensure that different array-like objects are correctly converted to an Index object, including a Series object, preventing the bug from occurring. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
