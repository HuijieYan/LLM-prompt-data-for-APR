## Analyzing the buggy function and related test function

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas.core.series.Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys during indexing operations on a Series.
2. The test function `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas.tests.series.indexing.test_getitem` file tests the behavior when indexing with a key that does not match any values in the Series index.
3. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access values using a non-existent key.
4. The buggy function `_get_with` has multiple conditional blocks to handle different key types, which may cause an issue in correctly identifying the key type and selecting the appropriate indexing method.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The conditional block checking for lists, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index keys might not properly handle different input key types.
2. The conditional block for handling cases where `key_type` is "integer" might not correctly differentiate between positional and label-based indexing.
3. The handling of Index keys and the type inference using `lib.infer_dtype` in the `key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` portion might have issues in accurately determining the key type.

## Cause of the bug
The bug likely occurs due to incorrect key type identification in the `_get_with` function. As a result, the function might be selecting the wrong indexing method or path when processing different key types. This can lead to unexpected behavior when trying to access values using various key types, as seen in the failing test case where a KeyError is not being raised as expected.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should:
1. Ensure proper identification and handling of key types to select the appropriate indexing approach.
2. Refine the key type checks and type inference logic to accurately determine the key type.
3. Make sure that non-existent keys result in raising a KeyError consistently.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        return self.loc[key[0]]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these modifications, the corrected function should be able to properly handle different key types and raise a KeyError for non-existent keys, passing the failing test cases.
