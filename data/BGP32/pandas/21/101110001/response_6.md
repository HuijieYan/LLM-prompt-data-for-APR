### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and indexes.
- The failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior of indexing by different types of key inputs including lists, arrays, pandas Index, and Series objects.
- The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is expected, but it does not get raised, hence the test fails.
- The current implementation of `_get_with` function has a logic issue when handling different key types, which leads to the failure in the test.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of the `_get_with` function that incorrectly handles different types of keys. The bug is specifically related to handling cases where the key is a list-like object.

### Fix Strategy:
- A potential fix strategy involves ensuring that when a list-like key is passed to the function, it correctly routes the operation to a suitable method (e.g., `.loc` or `.iloc`).
- Check the conditions for handling list-like keys, making sure to access elements correctly based on the type of the key object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key] if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() else self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key] if isinstance(key, list) else self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now correctly handles list-like keys by ensuring that the indexing operation is performed based on the type of the key object. By making these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing test case.
