### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is using incorrect logic to determine how to index the Series object when the key is a list, numpy array, or pandas Series object. This results in an incorrect behavior when trying to access items that do not exist in the Series index.

### Error Location:
The bug in the `_get_with` function is located in the following block of code:
```python
if isinstance(key, list):
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```
This condition is incorrectly handling list-like objects leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by assuming all list-like objects should be indexed using `.loc`, which can lead to incorrect results when items don't exist in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that when the key is a list or numpy array, we first check if all the elements in the key exist in the Series index. If they do, then use `.loc` for indexing. Otherwise, raise a `KeyError` indicating that some elements were not found in the index.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    missing_keys = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
    if missing_keys:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_keys} are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Testing:
With this corrected version of the function, the failing test should now pass and correctly handle the case where some items are not present in the Series index.
