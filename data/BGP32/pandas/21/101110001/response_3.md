### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` has issues when handling different types of `key`. It tries to determine the type of `key` and take appropriate action, but it is not handling some types correctly leading to errors.

1. It fails to handle the case when `key` is an instance of ABCDataFrame, leading to a `TypeError`.
2. It fails to handle the case when `key` is an instance of Index, resulting in an error.
3. It does not handle the case properly when `key` is a list, which creates problems when later evaluating the type and behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to incorrect handling of different types of `key`, leading to type errors or incorrect behavior in later parts of the function.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug:
1. Add proper handling for `key` being an instance of ABCDataFrame, returning an error message.
2. Ensure proper handling of `key` when it's an instance of Index to prevent errors.
3. Fix the logic for handling a list type `key` to avoid issues later in the function's execution.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert to list for consistent handling
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index for consistent behavior
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above corrections, the function should now properly handle different types of `key` inputs and not produce errors like the ones seen in the failing tests.
