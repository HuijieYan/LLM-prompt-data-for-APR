### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, the bug in this function resides in the condition checking for non-list-like keys, which is causing an incorrect index operation. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when using a key that is not present in the Series index, but the buggy function is not handling this case properly.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is present in the conditional block that checks for non-list-like keys. The bug occurs when attempting to index the Series with a key that is not present in the Series index.

### Bug Explanation:
- When a key is not list-like and is not recognized as a scalar, the function currently tries to assign it to a `loc` operation directly, which leads to the failure when an invalid key is used.
- The failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when an invalid key is used, but the bug in the function prevents this from happening.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Instead of going straight to the `loc` operation, the function should first check if the key is found in the index and raise a `KeyError` if it is not found.
- By properly handling the case where the key is not present in the Series index, the function can avoid the failing test scenario.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should handle invalid keys properly and raise a `KeyError` when necessary, passing the failing test scenario.
