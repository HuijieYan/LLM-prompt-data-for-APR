## Analyze the buggy function
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series. It currently has issues when dealing with a key that is not list-like, which leads to an error when the key is used to index the Series.

## Identify potential error locations
One potential error location is when the buggy function checks if `key` is not list-like. The intention seems to be to treat non-list-like keys as scalars to be passed to `self.loc` for indexing.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The buggy function fails when trying to index the Series with a non-list-like key, resulting in a `KeyError`. This error occurs because the code incorrectly assumes that scalars are being passed to `loc`, whereas scalars should be passed directly. The existing logic does not handle the case where `key` is a scalar or a non-list-like object properly.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle non-list-like keys. If the key is a scalar or a non-list-like object, it should be directly passed to `self.loc` for indexing. By correcting this logic, we can ensure that the indexing works correctly for keys that are not list-like.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue described:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version updates the logic to check for scalars or instances of the `ABCSeries` class before passing the key directly to `self.loc`. This change ensures that scalars are handled correctly when indexing the Series, and it should now pass the failing test scenarios.
