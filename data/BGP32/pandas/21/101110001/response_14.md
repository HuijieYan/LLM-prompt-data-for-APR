### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys in a pandas Series. The bug occurs when a specific type of key is passed, resulting in an exception not being raised when expected in the test scenarios provided.

The failing test cases are testing the behavior for different types of `box` values (list, numpy array, Index, Series). The bug seems to be related to how keys are processed based on their types.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the following code block:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
This condition should handle scalars not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. However, the return statement should call `self.loc`, not with the key directly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `key` is not list-like, the function tries to directly index the Series using `self.loc[key]` without checking the validity of the key. This leads to unexpected behavior when dealing with non-list-like objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the processing of non-list-like keys follows the appropriate logic. This includes converting scalar keys to a list-like type before indexing, and ensuring that the correct indexing method (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) is used based on the type of key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert non-list-like scalar keys to list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of non-list-like scalar keys has been fixed to convert them to a list before indexing the Series using `self.loc`. This ensures that the correct indexing method is used for all types of keys.
