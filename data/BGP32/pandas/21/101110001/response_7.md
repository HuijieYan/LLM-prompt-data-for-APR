### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of keys for indexing, but it is failing to properly handle the case when a single key is provided that is not list-like. This causes an error when the test function tries to index using a single key that is neither a list nor an ndarray.

### Bug:
The bug is due to the `_get_with` function not properly handling the case when a single key that is not list-like is passed for indexing. This causes the function to try using the key as a label which results in a KeyError when the key is not present in the index.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of keys correctly. Specifically, when a single key is not list-like, it should be treated as a positional indexer instead of a label-based indexer. 

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if lib.is_scalar(key):  # Check if the key is a scalar
            return self.iloc[key]  # Treat as positional indexer
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected implementation will correctly handle the case when a single key is provided that is not list-like, treating it as a positional indexer to avoid the KeyError issue.
