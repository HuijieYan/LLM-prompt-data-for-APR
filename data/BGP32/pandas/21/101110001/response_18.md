### 1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, corresponding error message:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling indexing logic in the `Series` object. It checks the type of the key being used for indexing and takes different actions based on the type. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a `Series` object with an array of values that do not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.

### 2. Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
The bug might be related to how the key is handled in the `_get_with` function, especially when the key is being transformed to a list for processing. This transformation and subsequent operations might be causing unexpected behavior when trying to index with a non-existent value.

### 3. Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the failing test, the corresponding error message:
The bug is likely occurring in the section of the function where the key is being converted to a list and then processed based on the type. When the key contains elements that don't exist in the index, the function should ideally raise a `KeyError`, but due to incorrect handling or transformation of the key, this error is not being raised as expected.

### 4. Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
The key handling part of the function should be reviewed to ensure that the processing logic correctly identifies and raises a `KeyError` when elements of the key don't exist in the index. Specifically, the handling of the key as a list or in a list-like form might need to be adjusted to maintain the correct behavior.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "boolean":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle the key indexing logic more accurately, raising a `KeyError` when necessary and following the appropriate indexing methods based on the key type. It ensures that when elements of the key do not exist in the index, a `KeyError` is raised as expected.
