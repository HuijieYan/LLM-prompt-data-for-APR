### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test:
1. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function is testing the behavior when indexing a `Series` with a key that doesn't match any elements in the index.
2. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message.
3. The failing test indicates that the `KeyError` is not being raised as expected, leading to a test failure.
4. The bug is likely in the `_get_with` function, specifically in how it handles non-existing keys when reindexing.
5. The function `_get_with` should distinguish between positional and label-based indexing correctly to avoid the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `_get_with` function handles the case where the key does not exist in the index by raising a `KeyError` with the appropriate message.
2. Avoid converting the key to a list if it's not already a list, to prevent changing the expected behavior.
3. Make sure that the function correctly distinguishes between label-based and positional indexing to choose the appropriate indexing method.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key

    elif is_bool(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    # Remaining logic for other types of keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "boolean":
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected `_get_with` function includes the necessary checks to raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message when the key doesn't match any elements in the index. By handling this case correctly, the function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior for indexing with non-matching keys.
