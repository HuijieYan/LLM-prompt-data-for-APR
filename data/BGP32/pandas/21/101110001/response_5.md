### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case when the key is an instance of `pd.Series` properly. It is attempting to access the key directly without considering its type. This behavior leads to a `KeyError` when attempting to access an index that does not exist in the series.

### Bug Location:
The issue is with the following line in the buggy function:
```python
return self.reindex(key)
```
In this line, when the key is of type `pd.Series`, it should not be used directly for reindexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by improper handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. When the key is an instance of `pd.Series`, it is directly passed on to `reindex`, causing a `KeyError` when attempting to access a non-existent index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the key is of type `pd.Series` differently. We should avoid direct reindexing with a Series since it can lead to errors. Instead, we can convert the series to a list or index and then perform the necessary operation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, pd.Series)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version will handle the case when the key is a `pd.Series` gracefully by converting it to a list before performing any operations, preventing the `KeyError` that was occurring.
