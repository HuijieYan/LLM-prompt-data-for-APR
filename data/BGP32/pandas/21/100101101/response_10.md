## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs and route them to the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`). However, there are issues in the current implementation that cause the function to fail for certain types of inputs.

In the failing test case, the input `key` is passed as a Series object of dtype object, converted to different types (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) within the test function. The expected behavior is for the function to raise a `KeyError`, indicating that the specified key does not exist in the Series index.

Based on the provided runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values, the key issue seems to be with the conditional checks and branching inside the `_get_with` function. The function is not correctly handling the `key` input in the given test scenarios.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the buggy implementation, the function does not account for the case when `key` is an instance of a Series object which is being converted to different types.
2. The function incorrectly identifies `key` as `'integer'` type when it is actually of type `'string'` in the failing test cases.
3. The conditional branches in the function do not properly account for the scenario of dealing with keys that are Series objects of dtype object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to:
1. Update the conditional checks to handle Series objects correctly.
2. Ensure that the function identifies the true type of the `key`.
3. Route the handling of the key based on its correct type.

## Corrected Implementation
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, Index) or is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected implementation provided above, the function should now correctly handle the conversion and indexing of keys, passing the failing test cases with the expected behavior.
