Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, the issue arises from the incorrect handling of the key type in the `_get_with` function. The function fails to properly identify the key type in certain scenarios, leading to the KeyError exception in the tests.

To address this issue, we need to modify the key type identification logic in the function. Specifically, we should ensure that the key type is properly detected in all cases, including when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the redundant check for the key type being a list and modified the key type detection logic to cover all possible input types. This modification should address the bug and make the function work correctly with the failing tests.
