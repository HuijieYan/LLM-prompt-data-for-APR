### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of non-matching keys when accessing the Series. The function incorrectly assumes that all non-matching keys should be treated as label-based indexing, leading to a KeyError in cases where positional indexing is required.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the key handling logic in the function to differentiate between label-based indexing and positional indexing based on the type of key provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if (key_type == "integer") or (is_integer(key) and not self.index.is_unique):
            # Positional indexing
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # Label-based indexing
            return self.loc[key]

    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported type for key: {type(key)}")
```

With this corrected version of the function, we properly differentiate between label-based and positional indexing based on the type of key provided, ensuring that the access to the Series with non-matching keys is handled correctly for both scenarios.
