### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the type of key is not recognized correctly, leading to improper handling of the input key. The buggy function fails to handle the case where `key` is passed as a Series object in various forms like list, ndarray, Index, or Series. This causes a KeyError due to incorrect indexing behavior when trying to access non-existent values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case where `key` is a Series object. We can modify the function to extract the values from the Series object `key` and then proceed with the indexing operation based on the extracted values. This approach will align the function's behavior with the expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle Series objects as `key` inputs and pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values.
