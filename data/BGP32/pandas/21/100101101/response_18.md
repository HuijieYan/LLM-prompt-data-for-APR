### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the input key types. In the buggy function, when the key is not recognized as a specific type, it falls back to using the `loc` method to access the elements. This leads to a KeyError in the test case because the key `'C'` is not present in the index of the Series, causing an incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the function to properly handle the case when the key is not found in the index. We should check if the key is present in the index before using the `loc` method to access the elements.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is present in the index
    if not is_list_like(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"Key {key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to ensure the key is present in the index before accessing its elements, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring in cases where the key is not found. This correction should make the function behave as expected and satisfy the failing test cases.
