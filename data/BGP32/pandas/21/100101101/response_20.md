### Buggy Function Analysis:
The `_get_with` function checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different operations based on the type. The bug seems to occur when the `key` parameter is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an instance of specific types.

### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The specific bug is likely to arise when the `key` parameter is not recognized as list-like and does not match any of the specified types in the conditional checks. This leads to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, resulting in unexpected behavior during indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not have a valid handling mechanism for certain types of inputs, such as when `key` is not recognized as a list-like object but falls outside the defined type checks.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to provide a more general handling mechanism for cases where the `key` parameter does not match any of the specified types. The function should handle such cases in a consistent manner.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have included a more general handling mechanism for cases where the `key` parameter is not recognized as list-like and is not an instance of specific types. This should address the bug and ensure consistent behavior for different types of inputs.
