### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of key types. The function checks if the key is an integer, list, numpy array, or other types, and based on that, it tries to determine whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`). However, the function fails to consider the case where the key is of type `Index`. As a result, it incorrectly infers the key type as `'integer'`, leading to the wrong indexing method being used.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the key is of type `Index`. We should check for this specific type before inferring the key type as `'integer'`. By making this adjustment, we can ensure that the correct indexing method is chosen based on the actual key type.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the check for `Index` type early in the function and correctly setting the `key_type`, we ensure that the correct indexing method is chosen based on the actual key type. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in all cases.
