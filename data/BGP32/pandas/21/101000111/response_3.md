## Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function, `_get_with`, is intended for handling different types of indexing keys in a Pandas Series. The function checks the type of the key and then processes it accordingly. However, there is an inconsistency in how the function handles Index types compared to list, ndarray, and Series types. This inconsistency creates a bug that needs to be addressed.

## Potential Error Locations

The bug is likely to occur in the following section of the code:
```python
if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```

The issue may arise from the condition `isinstance(key, Index)` as it may not be handling the Index type correctly along with other types.

## Cause of the Bug

The bug originates from the inconsistency in how the function handles different types of keys for indexing. The function correctly identifies the key type as Index in some instances but does not handle it consistently with other types like list, ndarray, and Series. This deviation leads to incorrect processing and potential errors in returning the desired result.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle Index types in a consistent manner with other types of keys. It should ensure that the processing logic for different key types aligns and returns the expected output for all cases.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function `_get_with`, the issue related to handling Index types is resolved. The key type is now inferred using `lib.infer_dtype` for all inputs, ensuring consistent processing and returning the expected output for all cases specified in the failing test execution.
