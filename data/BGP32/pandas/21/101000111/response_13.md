## Analyzing the buggy function and its issues
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs to access values from a Series object. The main issue arises when dealing with list-like keys, especially when the key is not found in the Series index. The function currently tries to directly access the key using `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to key errors when the key is not present in the index.

From the expected cases and the provided GitHub issue, it is evident that the current implementation of how list-like keys are handled is causing inconsistencies and potential errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug and address the inconsistencies seen in the test cases and the GitHub issue, we need to update how list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function. Instead of directly accessing the key using `self.loc[key]`, we should first validate if all the keys are present in the index. If not, handle these cases appropriately to prevent key errors.

## The corrected function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, when handling list-like keys, we first check if all the keys are present in the Series index. If they are all present, we return the values corresponding to those keys using `self.loc[key]`. Otherwise, if any key is missing in the index, we handle this situation by calling `self.reindex(key)` to perform a reindexing operation. This approach ensures consistent behavior and prevents key errors when accessing values using list-like keys not present in the index.
