## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas has potential issues in handling different types of input `key`. The bug seems to stem from the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The cases provided with expected values and types should guide us in understanding the required fixes.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect conversion or handling of different types of `key`.
2. Inconsistent treatment of `key` between list-like and other array-like types.
3. Improper inference of `key_type` leading to incorrect branching in the function's logic.

## Bug Cause
The bug stems from the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The mixing of handling list-like `key` differently than array-like `key` types leads to the failure to provide expected results for certain cases.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of `key`. We should aim to treat all types of `key` similarly to avoid incorrect outcomes. By adjusting the logic to handle all types of `key` uniformly, we can resolve the issue of inconsistent behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        if not self.index.is_boolean():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that all types of `key` are uniformly handled and processed correctly in the `_get_with` function, we can fix the bug and achieve the expected outcomes as described in the provided cases.
