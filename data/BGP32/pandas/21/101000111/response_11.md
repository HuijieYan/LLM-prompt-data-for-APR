Based on the provided buggy function and the expected values, we can identify potential error locations as follows:

1. The `key_type` variable assignment.
2. The condition checking for the type of `key`.
3. The case handling based on the type of `key`.
4. The return statements based on the type of `key`.

The bug occurs due to incorrect classification and handling of the `key` variable types, leading to issues in determining the appropriate action to be taken based on the key type. To fix the bug, we need to revise the approach to categorizing `key` types and adjust the subsequent behavior accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the identified issues:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version revises the categorization of `key` types and adjusts the return logic to address the issues identified. This should align with the expected behavior outlined for different cases and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
