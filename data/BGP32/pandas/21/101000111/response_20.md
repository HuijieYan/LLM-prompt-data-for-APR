The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is caused by the incorrect handling of the key type when processing the input. The code contains unnecessary conversions and checks that lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling different types of keys. Instead of checking for specific types and converting them, we should focus on correctly identifying the key type and handling it accordingly. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types
    if key_type in ('integer', 'mixed-integer'):
        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly identified and processed accordingly. It also removes unnecessary checks and conversions that were causing the bug.

By implementing these changes, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of input keys and return the expected results as described in the provided test cases.
