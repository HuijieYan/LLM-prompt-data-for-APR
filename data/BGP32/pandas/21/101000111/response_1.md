## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, the bug arises when different types of keys are passed to the function, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

In the provided cases, the function should determine the `key_type` based on the key passed, and then decide whether to return the result using label-based indexing or positional indexing. However, the function is not handling the cases correctly, leading to incorrect results.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers when indexing a Series object. The bug results in failures when handling these different types of indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of key passed and handles each type appropriately by either using label-based indexing or positional indexing.

We will modify the condition checks for different key types and ensure that the function returns the correct result based on the input key type. By addressing these issues, we can resolve the inconsistencies and errors encountered with different types of indexers.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like scalars using loc
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert keys to list for consistency
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Determine the type of the key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle integer-type keys
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Reindex for other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these modifications, we ensure that the corrected function properly handles different types of keys for indexing a Series object, resolving the issues and inconsistencies encountered with the previous implementation.
