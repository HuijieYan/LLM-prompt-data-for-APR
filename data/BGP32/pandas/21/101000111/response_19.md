### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is called in the context of indexing a Series object.
2. The function handles different types of keys: slices, DataFrame, tuples, scalars, lists, np.arrays, ExtensionArray, Series, Index. 
3. The bug seems to occur when handling lists as keys, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to other indexer types.
4. The key type inference is based on the Dtype of the input key, which may lead to incorrect handling of the key.

### Error:
The bug arises in the handling of list-like keys inside the `_get_with` function. When a list key is encountered, it is not properly processed, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other key types. The key type inference logic may also cause issues.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for list-like keys by handling them appropriately.
2. Improve key type inference to avoid incorrect handling of keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently and improves the key type inference logic to appropriately determine the key type for indexing.
