### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` expects a key as input and processes it based on its type. It handles different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists.
2. The buggy function contains a section where it determines the type of the key and processes it accordingly.
3. The bug is causing incorrect handling of the key's type and not returning the expected output in some cases. This bug is observed in different input types like lists, numpy arrays, and Index objects, resulting in incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is correctly processed based on its type and return the appropriate output.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the key's type, especially when it is a list, numpy array, or Index object. The function should handle these input types correctly according to the expected behavior.

### Proposed Fix:
I will modify the code to handle the key types more accurately, ensuring that the correct processing is done based on the type of the key.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling key as list, numpy array, or Index object
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Convert key to a list if not already
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version should properly handle various types of keys like lists, numpy arrays, and Index objects, ensuring that the function returns the expected output in all cases provided in the test cases.
