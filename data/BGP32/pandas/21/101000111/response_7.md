### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys and then return the corresponding values from the Series object. The issue arises from the inconsistency in the handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function currently fails to process the key correctly when it is a list, leading to unexpected behavior.

#### Error Locations
1. The function fails to correctly handle list-like keys, leading to an incorrect result.
2. The key_type variable is not set correctly for the provided input.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When the key is of type list, the function mistakenly treats it as a single value to use for indexing, leading to unexpected results. This causes the inferred key_type to be set incorrectly, potentially leading to further issues down the line.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers in Pandas, which is reflected in the behavior observed in the buggy function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly within the `_get_with` function. By recognizing that a list key should be processed as a collection of indices rather than a single index, we can resolve the issue and ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):  # Correctly handling list-like keys
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to correctly process list indexers and ensuring the key_type is set appropriately based on the input, the corrected version should provide consistent and expected results for various types of keys.
