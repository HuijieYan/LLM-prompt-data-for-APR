## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas module is supposed to handle different types of indexer inputs like slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc., and return the corresponding values. The bug arises when dealing with key types that are not list-like and not recognized as scalars.

The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the behavior of `ser[list(key)]` differs from other cases like `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]`, leading to inconsistent results and throwing a KeyError for the list case. This inconsistency needs to be addressed in the `_get_with` function.

## Bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of non-list-like keys that are not recognized as scalars. When encountering such keys, the function tries to use them as an index or reindex the series, leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of non-list-like keys in a more consistent and appropriate way. We can modify the logic to differentiate between different key types and handle them accordingly to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Non-list and non-recognized scalars
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for scalar keys before proceeding with loc or positional indexing. For keys that are neither list-like nor scalar, we handle them using loc directly, considering them as individual key values. This adjustment aims to provide a more consistent behavior when dealing with various types of keys in the `_get_with` function.
