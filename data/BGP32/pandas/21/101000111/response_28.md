### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalars, and determine the appropriate operation based on the key type.
2. The bug occurs when `key` is passed as a list-like object that isn't recognized as an iterable, causing an error in the subsequent logic.
3. The bug relates to the issue of inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers in Pandas, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled properly and do not result in errors while maintaining consistency with other types of indexers.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When `key` is passed as a list-like object that isn't recognized as iterable, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, assuming it's a valid indexing operation.
2. This assumption fails for certain types of list-like keys, leading to an error.
3. Due to inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers, the function fails to distinguish appropriate actions for list-like keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `key` is list-like and handle it appropriately without assuming direct access like `self.loc[key]`.
2. Determine the correct operation based on the characteristics of the key object and handle it consistently with Pandas indexing logic.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys appropriately
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types accordingly
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the suggested corrections and validations for list-like keys, the function now handles different key types consistently and avoids errors caused by assumptions about the key's properties.
