To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. The issue on GitHub points out this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers. 

The key observation is that when using `ser[list(key)]`, a KeyError is raised, but this does not happen with other types of indexers. This suggests that the bug lies in the handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the code in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. We can achieve this by providing a similar treatment for list indexers as for array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner by treating them similarly to other types of indexers, such as array-like indexers. By making this adjustment, we address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.
