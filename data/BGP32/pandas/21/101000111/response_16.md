The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic related to handling different types of indexers for a Series object. The issue stems from how different indexers (such as list, Index, ndarray) are processed and how the key_type is inferred based on the input key. The bug can cause incorrect behavior and return unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly determined based on the key input. We should also handle different types of indexers consistently to prevent unexpected behavior. The key_type should be checked accurately, and actions should be taken accordingly to either use positional or label-based indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = ensure_platform_int(lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False))

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if self.index.inferred_type == 'integer':
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the key_type is inferred accurately, and the handling of different indexer types is made consistent. The function should now return correct results based on the input key and avoid the unexpected behavior observed in the buggy version.
