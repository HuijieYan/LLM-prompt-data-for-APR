### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs to index a Series object.
2. The bug arises because when `key` is a list-like object, the function does not handle it correctly according to the expected behavior.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with list-like objects compared to other types of indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are correctly handled within the function to maintain consistency in behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when `key` is a list-like object. It fails to handle the indexing correctly for list-like objects, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistency with other types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted by the GitHub issue where indexing with list-like objects raises an error, unlike other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and maintain consistency in behavior, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that list-like objects are processed properly and do not raise errors as observed in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like objects are correctly handled within the function, resolving the inconsistency issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
