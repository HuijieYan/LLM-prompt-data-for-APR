### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs and return the corresponding values based on the type of the key. It should correctly identify the type of the key and then proceed to return the values accordingly. However, the bug seems to lie in the type identification process, which leads to incorrect handling of the key in certain cases.

### Error location:
The bug may exist in the part of the function where it checks the type of the key using `is_list_like` and fails to differentiate between different types of key inputs correctly.

### Cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug stems from the incorrect identification of the key type. Due to the incorrect type identification, the function fails to handle the key appropriately, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially invalid processing of the key input.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled within the `_get_with` function. By correctly distinguishing between different key types, the function can return the values based on the type of key input.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correctly identifying the key type and handling it according to the type, the corrected function should now be able to handle various key inputs and return the corresponding values as expected.
