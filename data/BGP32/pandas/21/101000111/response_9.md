The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in treating different types of indexers. In the provided function, there are multiple conditions and checks for the type of `key`, but the handling of Index type is not done correctly. This leads to the bug when trying to access the value using a list-like Index.

To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the handling of the Index type and ensure that it is treated consistently with other types of key indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the Index type specifically and ensure that it is treated consistently with other indexers. This adjustment should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values and the reported GitHub issue regarding inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers.
