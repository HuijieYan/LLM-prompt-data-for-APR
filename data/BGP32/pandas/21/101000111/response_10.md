After analyzing the buggy function and the provided GitHub issue, the bug stems from inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series object. The issue points out a discrepancy in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects.

The bug in the `_get_with()` function arises when handling different types of indexers in the `key` parameter. It fails to handle the case where `key` is a list, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug and align the behavior with the expected input/output values and the issue on GitHub, we should update the `_get_with()` function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other indexers such as arrays or Index objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-Index non-list keys to list
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now handles list indexers by converting non-Index non-list keys to a list before inferring the key type and performing the necessary operations. This change aligns the behavior with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue raised on GitHub regarding inconsistent treatment of list indexers.
