## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, lists, arrays, and indices for a Series object. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles the case when the index is neither of the mentioned types nor a list. The function incorrectly tries to access the elements of the Series using `.loc` in this case, which leads to unexpected behavior.

## Error Location
The bug is likely located in the following section of the function:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when `key` is not of any recognized type or a list. The code mistakenly assumes that using `.loc` to access the element is the correct approach. This assumption is incorrect for cases where `key` is neither an array-like type nor a list. The bug results in unexpected behavior when trying to access elements with such non-standard `key` values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is neither an array-like type nor a list differently. Instead of trying to access the elements using `loc` directly, we should revisit the logic and determine the appropriate action based on the given `key` value.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and the bug fix strategy described above:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the case when `key` is neither an array-like type nor a list. It properly checks if `key` is an `Index` before proceeding with further operations and updates the flow accordingly.

The corrected function should now handle the given input cases as per the expected values and types mentioned for each case.
