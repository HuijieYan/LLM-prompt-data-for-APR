### Analyzing the Buggy Function and the GitHub Issue
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs when indexing a Series.
2. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other indexers (array-like or Index) in the pandas library.
3. The inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when accessing a Series using a list key compared to other types of keys.
4. The issue questions the compelling reason for treating list indexers differently and suggests making all indexers behave like the list case.
5. The bug might be related to how different types of indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of key types within the function based on `isinstance` checks.
2. Determining the `key_type` based on the inferred type of the key.
3. Conditional logic to decide whether to use `loc` or `iloc` based on `key_type`.
4. Handling duplicate indexing case when `key` is of type `list`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers, which leads to unexpected behavior during indexing operations. The key_type is incorrectly inferred for list-like keys, resulting in the wrong path being chosen for indexing (using `loc` instead of `iloc` or vice versa). This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, suggesting that all indexers should behave like the list case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic for inferring `key_type` to ensure consistency in treating list indexers.
2. Update the conditional logic to handle different types of keys consistently.
3. Ensure that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of key provided.
4. Address the duplicate indexing case for lists to handle it appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the duplicate indexing case for lists
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistency in handling different types of keys, inferring the `key_type` correctly, and using the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`). Additionally, the duplicate indexing case for lists has been properly addressed.
