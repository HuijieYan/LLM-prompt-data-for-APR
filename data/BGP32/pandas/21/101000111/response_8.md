### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of `key` inputs, such as list, tuple, Index, np.ndarray, etc., and make decisions based on the type of `key`. 
2. The bug seems to be present in determining the `key_type` incorrectly, which leads to wrong decisions being made regarding how to access the data.
3. The cause of the bug lies in improperly inferring the type of the `key` variable, leading to incorrect branching logic.
4. To fix the bug, we should accurately determine the type of `key` and apply the appropriate logic based on the type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to determine the type of the `key` input accurately.
2. If the type is 'string', we need to handle it appropriately.
3. Based on the type, we should decide whether to use `self.loc`, `self.iloc`, or `self.reindex`.
4. We should ensure that the branching logic is correctly applied based on the type of `key`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function accurately handles the branching logic based on the type of the `key`, ensuring that the correct operations are applied for different types of input. This should fix the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values.
