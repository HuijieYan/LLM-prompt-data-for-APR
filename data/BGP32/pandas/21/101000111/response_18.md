### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class handles different types of input keys and determines the appropriate action based on the type of key. The issue occurs when dealing with a list-like key where the function should handle it consistently irrespective of the type of key. The expected behavior should align with the issue reported on GitHub about inconsistencies when using list indexers.

### Identified Error Location:
The bug in the function occurs when handling list-like keys, resulting in an inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of list-like keys, causing unexpected behavior compared to other key types. This leads to discrepancies in the behavior observed in the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys, particularly list-like keys, are handled consistently. The function should treat list-like keys in a manner consistent with the behavior expected for such keys, aligning with the GitHub issue and maintaining coherence within the function.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, we handle all types of keys uniformly. If the key is not list-like or is an instance of certain types, we convert it to a list. Then, we infer the key type and proceed accordingly, either using `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type. This correction ensures consistency when dealing with different types of keys, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
