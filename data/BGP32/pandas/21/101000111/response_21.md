**Analysis:**
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for indexing a Series based on different types of input keys.
2. The bug is related to how the function handles indexers when passed as a list.
3. The function checks different conditions based on the input key type to determine the appropriate way to index the Series.
4. The bug seems to be in the handling of cases where the key is a list.
5. The root cause is in how the function interprets and processes keys of type list, leading to incorrect behavior during indexing.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Identify the correct way to handle list keys for indexing the Series.
2. Ensure that the function processes the key appropriately based on its type.
3. Modify the code to handle list keys correctly and return the expected results in all cases.
4. Validate the fix with the provided test cases to ensure the corrected function behaves as expected.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Updated condition to correctly handle list keys
    if isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function now includes an updated condition to handle list keys appropriately and return the expected results. This fix addresses the issue related to indexing a Series with list-like keys.
