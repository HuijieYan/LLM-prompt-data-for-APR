### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a `Series` object. The function checks the type of the key and performs specific actions based on its type. However, there is a bug related to how the function treats different types of key inputs, specifically when the key is a list-like object.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the section where the function checks if the key is not list-like and then falls back to `self.loc[key]`. This design is incorrect because it does not handle list-like keys appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The current implementation does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing a `Series` object with a list-like key. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of key inputs. The bug is evident from the provided test cases, where indexing with a list-like key results in a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like keys. We should treat list-like keys differently from scalar keys and ensure consistent behavior across different types of key inputs. Specifically, for list-like keys, we should return the desired result without raising KeyError or other exceptions.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now correctly handles list-like keys by directly using `self.loc[key]` without unnecessary conversions or raising exceptions. The modification ensures that the function behaves consistently for different types of key inputs.
