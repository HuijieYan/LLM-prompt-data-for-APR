### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of indexers for a Series object. However, there are inconsistency issues in how different types of indexers are handled, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The function fails to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Error Location
The primary error location lies in the conditional branch for handling list-like keys. The incorrect assumption leads to an incorrect determination of the `key_type` variable.

### Bug Explanation
In the cases provided, the function fails to recognize the key as a list-like object, resulting in its treatment as a non-list-like object. This leads to incorrect handling of the key, causing the function to return unexpected results or raise errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to enhance the conditional check for list-like objects and ensure that the function correctly identifies such cases. By revisiting the handling of list-like keys and treating them appropriately, we can address the inconsistency in the function's behavior.

### Bug-Free Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle list-like objects appropriately, resolving the inconsistency issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
