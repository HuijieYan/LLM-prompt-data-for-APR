### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series but contains several logic errors based on the provided runtime values and expected values. In all the test cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, despite the actual type of keys being lists, ndarrays, or Index objects.

### Error Location:
1. The primary error lies in the logic that determines the `key_type` based on the input key, resulting in incorrect type identification.
2. The conditional check for `key_type == "integer"` and the decision to use `self.loc` or `self.iloc` is not functioning correctly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to inaccurate type inference for the `key` parameter within the function. The function fails to properly identify the true type of the key, resulting in incorrect processing of different key types and consequent misinterpretation of the key type, particularly as `'string'`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function:
1. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the actual type of the key being used.
2. Adjust the conditional statements based on the corrected `key_type`.
3. Ensure that the function correctly handles lists, ndarrays, and Index objects as keys for indexing the Series.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_object_dtype(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the logic for identifying the `key_type` and adjusting the conditional checks based on the true type of the key, the function should now correctly handle various types of keys for indexing a Series, as per the expected values outlined in the test cases provided.
