The issue arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.) in the `_get_with` function of the Series class in pandas. The function fails to properly distinguish between the types of indexers, leading to the incorrect identification of the key type.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that if an indexer is not an integer type and doesn't fall into any known types, it can be treated as a label-based indexer and calls `self.loc[key]`. This assumption is incorrect in cases where the key is not recognized as a list-like type or an array-like type, as this may include valid cases where a different type of key is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the key type based on the given indexers and handle each type appropriately. We should avoid making assumptions about the key type and instead implement logic that correctly identifies the type and uses the corresponding accessor (`iloc` or `loc`).

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is accurately determined and handled accordingly to avoid the issue as described in the GitHub problem statement.
