The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of how pandas treats different types of indexers (specifically list indexers) in the context of a Series. The code being discussed attempts to handle various types of indexers, but fails to do so properly, leading to the reported bug.

The function `_get_with` is meant to process different types of key inputs, but it has issues with correctly identifying the type of input key due to the way the `key_type` variable is determined.

The `key_type` variable is determined based on the type of the `key` input. However, in all the provided runtime cases, `key_type` is identified as `'string'`, which is unexpected. This indicates that the method used to determine the type of `key` is flawed.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic used to determine the type of `key`. One way to do this is by directly checking for the type of `key` rather than inferring it. We can modify the initial part of the function to include explicit checks for different types of `key` such as list, ndarray, Index, etc., ensuring that the correct type is identified.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = type(key).__name__

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly check the type of `key` and handle each case accordingly. This should fix the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
