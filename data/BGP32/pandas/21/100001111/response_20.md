The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from incorrect handling of different types of key inputs. The function fails to correctly determine the key type, leading to incorrect branching and unexpected behavior.

The bug is triggered by the function's faulty key type inference logic, which results in misinterpreting certain key types. The incorrect behavior results in returning incorrect results or raising unnecessary exceptions.

To fix the bug, the key type should be determined accurately to choose the correct path for processing. By identifying the key type correctly, the function can handle different input types appropriately, leading to the expected behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly identifying the key type and selecting the appropriate processing logic based on that type. It ensures that the function behaves correctly for different key inputs, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.
