### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The function handles slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list-like scalars, Index, and different types of arrays for indexing.
3. The issue seems to be centered around the improper handling of key types, leading to incorrect results and possibly raising errors when attempting to index a Series.
4. The GitHub issue points out inconsistencies in indexing behavior when using different types of key indexers, especially regarding lists and arrays.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug arises from the mishandling of key types in the `_get_with` function, particularly when dealing with lists and Index objects, leading to incorrect indexing operations and potential errors.
2. The function does not appropriately differentiate between types of keys in some cases, resulting in unexpected behaviors when accessing Series elements.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Implement a more robust check for the different types of key indexers, especially for lists and Index objects, to ensure consistent and correct indexing behavior.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles all possible key types to avoid errors and produce the expected results.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # Ensure scalar keys are handled correctly
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle both list and Index as key

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes a more comprehensive handling of different key types, especially addressing the issues related to lists and Index objects mentioned in the GitHub issue. This version aims to provide consistent and expected behavior when indexing a Series with various types of keys.
