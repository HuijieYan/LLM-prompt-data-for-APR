### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexing to retrieve values from a Series object in pandas. There seem to be issues with how certain cases are handled, leading to incorrect behavior. The function should correctly differentiate between list-like indexers, numeric indexers, and other types to accurately retrieve values.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Incorrect handling of distinguishing between different types of indexers.
2. Ambiguity in how non-traditional indexers are processed.
3. Incorrect detection of the key_type, especially when dealing with different types of indexes.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect identification of index types, especially in situations involving keys that are not traditional list-like or numeric values. This causes the function to incorrectly determine the `key_type`, leading to the wrong indexing strategy being employed.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly differentiate between list-like, numeric, and other types of indexers.
2. Ensure proper handling of specific cases, such as Index or ndarray indexers.
3. Accurately determine the `key_type` based on the type of key being used for indexing.
4. Implement a more robust logic to handle different types of keys to ensure the correct data retrieval.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or is_dict_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_platform_int(key)
    
    if is_bool(key):
        if key.inferred_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function applies more specific checks for different types of key indexers and ensures the proper slicing, retrieval, or reindexing strategy based on the key type. It fixes the bug by addressing the inconsistencies in handling various indexer types.
