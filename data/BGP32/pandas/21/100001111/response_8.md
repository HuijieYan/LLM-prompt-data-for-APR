### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys while indexing a Series. However, there is a bug in the type handling section where it incorrectly identifies the `key_type` leading to unexpected behavior. The issue described on GitHub further highlights inconsistencies in the behavior of indexing with different types of keys, especially when using a list key.

### Error Location:
The main error in the function occurs when determining the `key_type` based on the type of key provided, leading to incorrect behaviors. This affects how the indexing operation is handled subsequently.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In Cases 1 to 3, regardless of the type of input key provided, the function identifies the `key_type` as a string due to incorrect handling of different types.
2. This incorrect identification of `key_type` results in the function behaving unexpectedly when indexing the Series, which ultimately leads to incorrect results similar to the GitHub issue described.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to accurately identify the type of the key provided and handle the indexing operation accordingly. Also, we need to ensure consistency in behavior when indexing with different types of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly identify the type of the key given, ensuring correct behavior during the indexing operation and resolving the issue outlined in the GitHub report.
