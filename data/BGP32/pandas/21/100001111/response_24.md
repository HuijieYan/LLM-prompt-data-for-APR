The bug in the function `_get_with` lies in the incorrect handling of different indexer types for a Series object. The provided cases and expected values reveal that the function is not properly distinguishing between different indexer types, leading to incorrect behavior.

The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other indexer types. The current function does not handle all indexer types uniformly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To address this bug, the function needs to be modified to treat different indexer types consistently. Specifically, list-like indexers should be handled the same way as other indexer types to maintain coherence in behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the identified bug and expected input/output values:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert to list for uniform handling

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Remove special handling for different types of indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now handle all indexer types uniformly, including list-like indexers, to ensure consistent behavior and resolve the issue identified on GitHub.
