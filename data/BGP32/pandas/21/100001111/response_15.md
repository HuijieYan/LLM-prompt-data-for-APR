The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of key indexers. The function fails to properly distinguish between list-like, array-like, and other types of indexers, leading to incorrect behavior and potential errors.

### Error location:
1. The initial conditions for different key types are not efficiently handled.
2. The logic to determine the type of key and how to index the Series is flawed.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug stems from not properly categorizing the indexer type, leading to incorrect handling based on assumptions that do not align with the actual types of keys being used.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly identify the key type, whether it is list-like, array-like, or another type, and then choose the appropriate indexing method accordingly.

### Proposed fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should appropriately handle different types of key indexers and apply the correct indexing method for each case, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
