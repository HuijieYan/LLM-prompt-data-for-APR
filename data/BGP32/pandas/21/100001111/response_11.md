### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. Based on the provided runtime values and expected values, it seems that the `key_type` determination logic in the function is incorrect. The way key types are inferred and processed leads to incorrect behavior, especially when dealing with non-matching indexes.

#### Issue:
The bug relates to incorrect inference of the `key_type`, leading to improper indexing handling for keys. This behavior results in inconsistent behavior when trying to index a Series using a DataFrame or an Index of non-matching keys.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Enhance the logic for inferring the key type to accommodate a wider range of key formats.
2. Ensure that the function can correctly handle different key types and not fail based on the inferred key type.
3. Refactor the function to have better flow control based on the key provided for indexing.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function improves the key type inference and supports a wider range of key types for indexing. It handles cases where the key is not a list-like or where the key type is integer or mixed type, which was missing in the original implementation. This revised version should now properly handle the given cases and support the expected behavior for indexing a Series.
