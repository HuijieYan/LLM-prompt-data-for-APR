### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
2. The function checks the type of the key and behaves differently based on the type detected.
3. The bug could potentially be related to how string keys are handled, leading to unexpected results or errors.
4. The GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in how different types of indexers for a Series are handled, especially when using a list as the key.

### Error:
The function does not handle the case where the key is a list correctly. It fails to properly address the list key type, causing issues when indexing the Series.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the function handles list keys appropriately, avoiding errors or unexpected behavior.
2. Follow a consistent approach for different key types to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected function now correctly handles list keys by converting them to a list type when necessary.
2. It checks if the key is list-like and not already an Index, ndarray, or Series before converting it to a list.
3. The key type detection and handling have been adjusted to ensure a consistent behavior for different key types.
4. The function should now align better with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
