The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the handling of the key's type and subsequent decision making based on that type. The issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior.

The key issue arises when dealing with keys that are not recognized correctly, leading to unexpected outcomes when trying to index the Series object.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the key type checks and the corresponding actions within the function to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        key_type = 'array'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == 'array':
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes adjustments to the key type checks and logic to handle different types of key indexers consistently. It addresses the inconsistencies in behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue.
