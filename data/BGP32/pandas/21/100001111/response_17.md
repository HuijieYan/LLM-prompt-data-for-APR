After analyzing the buggy function and the provided runtime values, expected values, and the GitHub issue description, the identified bug originates from the if-elif-else chain within the `_get_with` function. The issue particularly arises due to the incorrect handling of the key type in the function. The code incorrectly assumes the key type as `integer` when dealing with non-integer inputs, leading to incorrect behavior and outcomes.

To resolve the bug, it is crucial to accurately determine the key type based on the nature of the input key and subsequently execute the appropriate logic for each key type branch. The correction should ensure that the function behaves consistently regardless of whether the key is a list, array, or index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version first checks if the key is a list-like object before converting it into a list. It then correctly determines the key type using `infer_dtype` and processes the key based on its type. This correction ensures that the function handles various key types consistently and appropriately.
