The buggy function `_get_with` needs to be fixed to handle the different types of key input properly based on the given runtime values and expected values. The issue seems to stem from mismatches in handling different key types like lists, ndarray, and Index objects.

1. Potential Error Locations:
    - Incorrect handling of key types.
    - Improper differentiation of key types leading to incorrect behavior.
  
2. Cause of the Bug:
    - The bug arises from not properly differentiating and handling various key types like lists, ndarray, and Index objects, leading to inconsistent behavior based on the type of key used.
  
3. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
    - We need to ensure that the function handles different key types consistently and appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        return self.reindex(key)

    raise TypeError("Unrecognized key type")

```

This corrected version aims to address the issues regarding handling different types of keys consistently and appropriately.
