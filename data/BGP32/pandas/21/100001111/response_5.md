### Error Identification
1. The function `_get_with` is handling different types of `key` inconsistently which is leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The function is not properly distinguishing between Index, list, ndarray, and other key types, resulting in incorrect indexing.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of key types within the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly categorizing the key type and is encountering issues when trying to index based on the key, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function accurately identifies the type of key being passed (Index, list, ndarray, etc.).
2. Implement consistent indexing approach based on the key type to achieve the expected behavior.
3. Use appropriate checks and conversions to make sure the indexing is done correctly.

### Corrected Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for key type and perform indexing accordingly
    if isinstance(key, Index) or not is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

By implementing the correct key type checks and indexing for each type, the corrected function ensures consistent behavior based on the type of key being passed, resolving the issue and meeting the expected output for the given test cases.
