### Analyzing the Bug
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers for a Series object efficiently. However, it fails to distinguish correctly between different types of key inputs, leading to incorrect behavior. The function uses `isinstance` checks to determine the type of the key, but in some cases, it doesn't handle the key appropriately.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of key types and conversion to lists where it shouldn't be.
2. Inconsistent behavior with different key types, especially index and list-like objects.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the function not appropriately handling key types like lists and indices. This leads to misinterpretation of the key type and incorrect indexing behavior for Series objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function properly distinguishes between different types of keys.
2. Implement consistent behavior for indexers to avoid any unexpected outcomes.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and the provided test cases:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):  # Change to check if key is a scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):  # Check for various array-like key types
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        # Handle as list if the key is not recognized as an array-like object
        key = list(key)
        key_type = 'object'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the key type handling issues and provide consistent behavior for the different types of indexers in the Series object.
