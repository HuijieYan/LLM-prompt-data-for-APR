### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` handles different types of input keys and determines how to retrieve values based on the type.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers in `Series`.
- The function fails to handle certain cases where the input key is not recognized correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of different key types.
2. Inconsistent treatment of list indexers.
3. Failure to recognize certain key types causing unexpected results.

### Bug Cause:
- The function fails to properly recognize key types, leading to incorrect behavior such as raising errors or returning wrong results.
- In Case 1, the key type is mistakenly identified as `'string'`, which is incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that all key types are correctly identified and handled appropriately.
- Make the treatment of list indexers consistent with other indexers.
- Update the function to handle various key types correctly to align with the expected behavior and GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues by ensuring consistent handling of different key types and aligning with the expected behavior and the GitHub issue.
