### Analysis:
The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug arises when dealing with specific types of keys, leading to incorrect interpretations of the key type, resulting in an incorrect return value.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for the key type might not cover all possible cases correctly.
2. Handling of the key as a list or Index might not consider all valid scenarios.
3. Inconsistent handling of different key types might lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the key type, which impacts the subsequent operations within the function. The function fails to properly identify certain key types, leading to the wrong branch being executed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the key type detection mechanism to cover all possible cases accurately.
2. Ensure that the function handles different key types consistently and appropriately for indexing operations.
3. Consider the cases mentioned in the GitHub issue to align with expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version aims to improve key type handling, ensuring consistency and accurately determining the appropriate indexing method based on the key type.
