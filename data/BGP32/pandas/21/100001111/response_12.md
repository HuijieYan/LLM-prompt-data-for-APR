### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys to retrieve values from a Series object. The function contains conditional branches to determine the type of input key and perform the corresponding operation. The bug occurs in the case where the key is not list-like resulting in an incorrect operation. This bug is related to how different types of indexers (list, Index, ndarray, Series) are processed leading to incorrect outcomes.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle non-list-like keys, causing unexpected behavior based on the inferred key type. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how different indexers are treated and the error that arises when using a list-like key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function to properly handle non-list-like keys, ensuring a consistent behavior for all types of key indexers.
2. Resolve the issue raised on GitHub by aligning the behavior of different indexers and ensuring that proper error handling is in place.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected function modifies the condition for handling non-list-like keys, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of key indexers. By addressing this issue, the function now aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
