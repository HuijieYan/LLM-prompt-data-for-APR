### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series. The issue arises when the key is a list-like object, causing unexpected behavior. The function incorrectly categorizes the type of key in some cases and fails to handle list-like keys appropriately.

### Bugs Identified:
1. The function mishandles keys that are list-like objects, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. Incorrect classification of the key type in certain cases.
3. Lack of adequate handling for list-like keys.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided cases, the key types are assumed to be strings, even though they are list-like objects. This misclassification results in the function attempting to treat a list as a single value when indexing the Series, leading to a KeyError or other unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly identify and classify the key type based on its properties, such as being list-like.
2. Ensure appropriate handling for list-like keys to prevent errors and unexpected behavior.

### Bug-free Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function provides proper handling for list-like keys, ensuring correct indexing behavior and avoiding errors.
