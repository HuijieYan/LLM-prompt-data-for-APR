### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series in pandas. However, there are inconsistencies in how it deals with various types of indexers, especially when it comes to lists.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to be present in the section where the function checks the type of the key and handles it accordingly.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided cases, when a list-type key is passed, the function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'integer'`. This leads to the function attempting to operate as if it's dealing with integer-based indexing instead of label-based indexing, causing incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly identify the type of the key being passed, especially for list-type keys. If the type is not a recognized index type, the function should handle it correctly to avoid misguided indexing operations.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            if isinstance(key, list):
                return self.loc[key]
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the issue related to list-type keys and correctly handles their indexing without misinterpreting them as integers.
