### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key indexers on a Series object. The function contains a bug that leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with different types of key indexers.

### Error Location
The bug appears to be in the block that checks for the type of key, specifically in the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes incorrect handling of key indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when processing certain types of key indexers. In the provided test cases, when a key indexer is a scalar or a value that is not recognized correctly, the function fails to handle it correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, update the conditional checks to properly identify and handle different types of key indexers. Ensure that all cases are properly accounted for to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the conditional checks to correctly handle different types of key indexers, including scalars and unrecognized values. This should resolve the bug and ensure consistent behavior across all types of key indexers.
