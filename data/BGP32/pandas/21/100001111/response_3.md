The issue in the buggy function lies in the logic related to different types of key input such as list-like, Index, np.ndarray, etc. Based on the runtime and expected values, it seems that the bug arises when handling key types, resulting in incorrect handling of the key. The key type is incorrectly identified as "string," leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function incorrectly identifies the key type as "string" in all cases, which leads to the wrong path selected for processing the key.
- Due to this misinterpretation, the function fails to handle the key adequately when it is passed as a list, ndarray, or Index type. This results in incorrect indexing behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure accurate detection and handling of different key types such as list, array, Index, etc.
2. Modify the logic to correctly identify the key type and process it accordingly to ensure consistent indexing behavior across different key types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version involves fixing the conditional statements and logic to correctly identify and handle different types of keys for proper indexing behavior. Ensure to test the corrected function with the provided runtime and expected cases to verify that the bug has been successfully resolved.
