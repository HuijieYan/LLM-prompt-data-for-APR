### Analysis:
The bug seems to be related to how different types of keys (list, Index, ndarray, etc.) are handled within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The bug appears to manifest when the key is a list, causing unexpected behavior. The key_type inferred from the key should ideally match the actual type of the key, but in the failing cases, `'string'` is being inferred instead.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because of inconsistent handling of the key types. When the key is of type list, the function attempts to infer the key type, but instead of recognizing it correctly, it assigns it as a string. This incorrect inference likely leads to the wrong path being taken in determining whether the key should be treated as a positional or label-based indexer.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is essential to accurately determine the type of the key, especially when it is a list. Ensure that the key type is correctly inferred to maintain consistent handling of different key types in the function.

### Updated Code:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly inferred when dealing with list-like keys, preventing the bug from occurring. This fix maintains consistent handling of different types of keys in the `Series` class.
