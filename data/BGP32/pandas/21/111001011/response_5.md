## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. However, there is a bug when dealing with a list-like input key. The bug causes unexpected behavior and contradicts the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. The key issue lies in the handling of list-like keys.

### Potential Error Location
The bug is likely related to the section handling list-like keys:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
In this section, the function directly tries to access `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys without proper handling for list-like keys.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function improperly handles list-like keys. When the key is a list-like object, it should not directly access `self.loc[key]` as it causes unexpected behavior, inconsistent with other indexing methods like with NumPy arrays or Index objects.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify how list-like keys are handled in the function. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should introduce a proper handling mechanism for list-like keys to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By introducing proper handling for list-like keys, the corrected function aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and resolves the bug encountered in the function.
