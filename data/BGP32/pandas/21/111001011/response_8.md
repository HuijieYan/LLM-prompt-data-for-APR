### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is handling different types of key input (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) to retrieve values from a Series.
2. The bug occurs when dealing with a key that is not list-like but should be interpreted as a valid key for indexing (e.g., a scalar value).
3. The function checks for the type of the key and tries to infer its dtype, but the inference logic seems incorrect based on the provided runtime values.
4. The key type is determined as `'string'`, which is not a valid type for indexing operations, leading to the bug in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect inference of the key type as `'string'` when it should be recognized as a valid key for indexing. This leads to an error in the subsequent conditional statements and results in unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled according to its validity for indexing operations. Specifically, scalar values should be treated as valid keys even if they are not recognized as list-like.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle scalar values as valid keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by explicitly handling scalar values as valid keys for indexing operations, ensuring correct behavior when accessing values from a Series.
