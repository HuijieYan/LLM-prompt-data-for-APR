### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of Pandas is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalars. The bug seems to be related to the handling of indexers that are not array-like, leading to incorrect behavior and key type identification.

### Error Locations
1. The check for non-array-like key type might not be correctly identifying the type of the key.
2. The decision-making logic based on the key type might be flawed, leading to improper selections between `self.loc` and `self.iloc`.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided cases, the key type is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which indicates that the function is not properly recognizing the type of the key. This issue causes the function to go down the wrong execution paths, potentially leading to the wrong indexing choice.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Improve the key type identification logic to correctly detect the type of the key.
2. Correct the decision-making process to ensure appropriate selection between `self.loc` and `self.iloc` based on the identified key type.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with`
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_int_indexer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function improves key type identification and decision-making processes to handle different types of indexers correctly, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue. Make sure to test this corrected version with the provided failing cases to verify that the bug is successfully fixed.
