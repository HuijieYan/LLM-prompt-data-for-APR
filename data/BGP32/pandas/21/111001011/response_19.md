### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of `key` inputs, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and other index types, and perform different operations based on the type of the `key`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of cases where `key` is a list. The function incorrectly assumes the key is not list-like but then treats it as a list in subsequent logic, leading to inconsistencies and errors.
3. The key variable type check and the logic around handling different key types are not consistent, leading to unexpected behavior when dealing with list-like keys.
4. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how different indexers are handled and the lack of clarity in the reasons behind the differing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug originates from inconsistent handling of list-like keys. The function wrongly assumes that the key is not list-like, but then later treats it as a list without proper validation. This causes errors and inconsistencies in the function's behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should consistently check for list-like keys and adapt the logic accordingly. Proper handling of different types of indexers should be maintained for a robust and predictable behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is list-like
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we add proper checks for list-like keys and handle them consistently throughout the function. This ensures that the function behaves predictably for different types of keys.
