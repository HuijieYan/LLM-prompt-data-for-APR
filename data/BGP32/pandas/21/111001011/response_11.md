### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle different types of indexers such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc. However, there is an inconsistency in how list-like indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue where indexing a Series with a list leads to an error due to the check for the key in the index.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to arise from the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function performs various checks and conversions based on the type of the key provided, but the treatment of lists is not consistent with other types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when the key is a list, it is converted to a different type for further processing, leading to an unexpected behavior of trying to index on the original list which is not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This involves modifying the conditional statements and conversion steps to correctly process list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the case where key is a list
        result = self.iloc[key]
        if isinstance(result, Series) or isinstance(result, Index):
            return self.__class__(result, index=self.index)
        else:
            return result

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where the key is a list by first performing `iloc` indexing and then checking if the result is a Series or an Index to ensure proper handling. This modification addresses the inconsistency related to indexing with list-like objects in the `Series` class of pandas.
