### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of `pandas` library has a logical error in handling various types of input keys. The function is designed to work with different types of keys such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc., and determine the appropriate action based on the type of key passed. However, the buggy function fails to handle lists properly, leading to incorrect behavior as seen in the failing test cases.

1. The function checks if the key is list-like, but the subsequent logic handling lists is not correct, resulting in unexpected results.
2. It fails to differentiate between different types of key inputs, potentially leading to incorrect type inference and further processing.
3. The code does not handle the case of a list key appropriately, making it prone to issues when dealing with indexing using lists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the mishandling of list keys in the `_get_with(key)` function. When processing a list key, the function incorrectly infers the key type as a string instead of recognizing it as a list, leading to incorrect indexing operations and possible errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the failing test cases, the function `_get_with(key)` needs to be revised to correctly handle list keys. Specifically, the code should properly identify list keys and perform the corresponding indexing operations based on the type of key received.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly checks for list-like keys and handles them accordingly by converting them to a list if needed before proceeding with the indexing operations. This revision should address the incorrect type inference and ensure correct behavior when dealing with list keys.
