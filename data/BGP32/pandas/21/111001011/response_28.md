### Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of pandas encounters a list-like key that has no matches in the Series index. In such cases, the function incorrectly proceeds to the `return self.loc[key]` line instead of raising a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with the treatment of array-like and Index key types, which correctly raise a `KeyError` when there are no matches. The bug is linked to an inconsistency in handling different key types, as reported in the GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches."

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like key with no matches in the Series index is encountered, the function should raise a `KeyError` just like array-like and Index key types do. This will align the behavior for different key types and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

In the corrected version, for list-like keys, we added checks to ensure that if any key element does not exist in the Series index, a `KeyError` is raised, following the behavior of array-like and Index key types. This change will address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and provide a more uniform treatment of different key types in the `_get_with` function.
