### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing operations on a Series object. The bug likely stems from the incorrect detection of the `key_type` when processing the input `key`. In the provided cases, the key is a list-like object with different representations: a list, an ndarray, and an Index object. The issue seems to be related to how the `key_type` is inferred and handled, leading to an incorrect branch execution.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Determining the `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype` might lead to incorrect outcomes.
2. Branching logic based on the inferred `key_type` might not be adequate for all types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect inference of the `key_type` resulting in inconsistent handling of the key during indexing operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified for different types of indexers.
2. Adjust the branching logic to handle all types of indexers consistently.

### Corrected Version:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        # Handle the case where key is an Index object
        if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Handle unknown cases by reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the improper inference of `key_type` and ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers. By identifying scalars and list-like objects first, it resolves the inconsistencies in indexing operations on the Series object.
