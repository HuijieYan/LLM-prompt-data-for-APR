### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object and is not properly handled, leading to incorrect behavior. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers, resulting in unexpected outcomes.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the section where a key is checked for being list-like. The current code path for list-like keys does not handle the case effectively, leading to incorrect results.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the provided cases, the `key_type` variable is checked and determined to be `'string'`, which is incorrect for list-like keys.
2. The code does not distinguish list-like keys properly, leading to incorrect indexing operations and triggering the bug.
3. The bug causes unexpected behavior when trying to index the Series object with a list-like key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly distinguish and handle list-like keys separately within the `_get_with` function. This involves ensuring that list-like keys undergo correct handling to prevent the inconsistencies reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Handle the case of list-like keys
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        # Handle non-list-like keys as before
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
```

By incorporating the suggested fix, the function now distinguishes list-like keys correctly and ensures proper indexing behavior, addressing the reported bug and the issue raised on GitHub.
