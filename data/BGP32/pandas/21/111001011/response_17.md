### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Pandas Series. However, the bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the function. The function attempts to infer the type of the key and handle it accordingly, but it fails to correctly identify a list key, resulting in an incorrect branching path.

### Error Location
The error lies in the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When checking the type of the key, the function does not correctly identify a list key, leading to the wrong path being taken for processing.

### Cause of the Bug
In the provided cases, the function incorrectly infers the type of the key as `'integer'` instead of identifying it as a list. This incorrect inference branch leads to the subsequent mishandling of the key, causing issues in the function execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly identified and handled in the `_get_with` function. By properly recognizing a list key, we can direct the function to the appropriate processing path for list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Bug Fix Description
By incorporating an additional check for `is_list_like(key)` when handling different types of keys, we can ensure that list-like keys are correctly processed within the `_get_with` function. This modification helps in directing the execution flow based on the type of the key provided, resolving the bug related to incorrect inference of list keys.
