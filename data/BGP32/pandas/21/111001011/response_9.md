### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The issue arises when dealing with a non-existent key (such as 'C' in the provided test cases), leading to incorrect identification of the `key_type` as 'string', which causes the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect identification of the key type when processing non-existent keys. The function mislabels the key type as 'string' instead of recognizing it as an invalid key. This misclassification leads to the function attempting to index with the wrong method, resulting in unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for identifying the key type based on the input key. If the key is non-existent, it should be detected early to prevent further processing and return appropriate responses, such as NaN or raising a KeyError if necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key not in self.index:
        # Key does not exist in the index, return NaN or handle appropriately
        return np.nan
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Update:
In the corrected version, we first check if the key exists in the Series index before proceeding with further operations. If the key does not exist, we return NaN or handle the non-existent key scenario appropriately. This adjustment ensures that the function handles invalid keys correctly, preventing the misclassification of the key type and resolving the bug related to indexing with non-matching keys.
