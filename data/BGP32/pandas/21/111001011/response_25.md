### Analysis:
1. The `key` parameter seems to have different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) causing the function to have varied behavior based on the type.
2. The aim is to handle the case when `key` is a list, which was not correctly implemented in the buggy function as different operations were performed based on the type of `key`.
3. The bug originates from the conditional blocks of the function not being distinct enough, leading to incorrect branching based on the type of `key`.
4. The function should consistently treat `key` as a list since `is_list_like` is checked before other type-specific operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to treat `key` as a list when it is not recognized as list-like or falls outside the specific types (Index, ndarray, Series).
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the case when `key` is a list to align with the behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
3. Avoid unnecessary conversions or branching based on multiple types of `key`.

### Bug-Fixed Implementation:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
``` 

By consistently treating `key` as a list after verifying it's not recognized as list-like, the function now correctly deals with the scenario where `key` is a list, aligning with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
