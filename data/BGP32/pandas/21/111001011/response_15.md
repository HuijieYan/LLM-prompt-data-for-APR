The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from a misinterpretation of the key type when processing different types of key inputs. The function fails to properly handle the case where the key is a list, leading to incorrect behavior when attempting to index the Series.

### Bug Cause:
1. When a key is provided as a list, the function incorrectly categorizes it as non-list-like (due to non-recursive check) and tries to access that key directly as a label, leading to a KeyError.
2. The function doesn't cover all possible key types and doesn't handle list key input correctly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly identify list-like keys to ensure handling them appropriately.
2. Ensure that all key types are properly recognized and processed to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)  # Ensure key is always a list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are correctly identified and processed as lists to prevent unexpected behavior. It covers various key types and handles each appropriately to avoid errors like KeyError when indexing the Series.
