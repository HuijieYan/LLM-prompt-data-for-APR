### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The function checks the type of the key and performs various operations based on the key type.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles non-list-like indexers. It incorrectly categorizes non-list-like indexers as scalars which leads to incorrect behavior.
4. The identified error locations are where the function checks for the key type and when it decides whether to treat the key as positional or label-based.
5. The bug causes incorrect indexing behavior when non-list-like keys are used.
6. To fix the bug, we need to correctly classify the key type and handle non-list-like keys appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly identify the type of the key.
2. Handle non-list-like keys separately from scalars.
3. Ensure that the function can correctly index the Series based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking both if a key is scalar and not list-like, we address the erroneous categorization of certain keys, allowing for correct indexing behavior in the Series class.
