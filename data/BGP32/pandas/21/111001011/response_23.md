### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the bug is occurring when the key is a list and it is not correctly processed, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug arises due to the following conditions:
1. When the key is a list, the function calls `self.loc[key]`, assuming it is a valid indexing operation. This fails to account for the case where the key is a list of non-matching values, causing an error.
2. Inconsistent behavior shown for different types of indexers, especially when using a list as the key for indexing.
3. The function does not handle the case where the list key does not match any values in the index properly, leading to errors.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of the key before performing any indexing operations and have a separate handling mechanism for list-like keys.
2. Ensure consistent behavior for different indexer types, especially when using a list as the key.
3. Handle the case where the key does not match any values in the index gracefully, without raising errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Check if any values in the key are present in the index
        valid_indices = [k for k in key if k in self.index]
        if len(valid_indices) > 0:
            return self.loc[valid_indices]
        else:
            return pd.Series([np.nan] * len(key), index=key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function checks if any values in the key are present in the index before attempting to perform the indexing operation. If no matching values are found, it returns a Series with NaN values corresponding to the key list. This approach ensures a more robust handling of different types of indexers, especially when using lists as keys.
