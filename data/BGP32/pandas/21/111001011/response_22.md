### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is designed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing in a Series. The bug occurs when the input `key` is of type `list` and its elements are not found in the Series index. This behavior leads to incorrect handling of the slicing operation and results in a `KeyError` due to the mismatch of index values.

The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of the `key` list in cases where the list elements are not present in the Series index. The function does not appropriately address this scenario for a list `key`, leading to the raised `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the `key` is a list and some or all of its elements are not present in the Series index. This can be achieved by checking if each element of the `key` list is in the Series index before performing the indexing operation.

### Code Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_elements_present = all(elem in self.index for elem in key)
    if not key_elements_present:
        missing_elements = [elem for elem in key if elem not in self.index]
        raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_elements} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check (`key_elements_present`) to verify if all elements in the `key` list are present in the Series index. If any element is missing, a `KeyError` is raised with the list of missing elements.

This fix ensures that the function properly handles the case where elements in the `key` list are not found in the Series index, preventing the `KeyError` and improving the overall robustness of the function.
