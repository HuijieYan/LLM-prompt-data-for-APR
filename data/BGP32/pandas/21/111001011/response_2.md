### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. The bug seems to arise from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The current implementation is causing issues when dealing with list indexers, as shown in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function `_get_with`, the logic for handling different types of indexers is causing problems specifically when dealing with list indexers. When the key is not recognized as list-like or when it is not an instance of certain types, it falls back to `self.loc[key]`. This fallback approach leads to unexpected behavior when trying to index a Series with a list-like key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are correctly handled in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. We should update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly distinguish between different types of key input and address list indexers accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        # handle the dup indexing case for list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, we can ensure the correct behavior when indexing a Series object. This corrected version should address the issue highlighted in the GitHub problem statement.
