The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. The function should handle different types of key input (list, ndarray, Index) in a more uniform way to prevent issues like the one reported in the GitHub problem.

The bug arises when accessing the Series with a list key that has no matches. The error occurs due to the different behaviors of list-like and array-like indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently. We can bring the behavior of list indexers in line with array-like and Index key types to avoid unexpected errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list indexers consistently, aligning the behavior with array-like and Index key types. This modification should prevent unexpected KeyError exceptions when using list indexers that have no matches, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
