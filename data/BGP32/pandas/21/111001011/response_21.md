## Bug Analysis:

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The bug is related to the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function correctly processes slice, DataFrame, tuple, and specific scalar types correctly, but list indexers are causing issues.

The variable `key_type` determines the type of key passed for indexing, and based on this type, the function decides whether to use positional or label-based indexing (`iloc` or `loc`). In the case of list indexers, the function attempts to handle them differently, which leads to the bug.

The GitHub issue describes the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers, causing unexpected behavior and raising errors incorrectly.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to treat list indexers consistently with other types of indexers to align behavior across different types of indexing operations. This involves ensuring that list indexers go through the same processing steps as other types of indexers, allowing for proper indexing of the Series.

## Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers consistently with other types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list indexers the same way as other types, we ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexing operations on the Series, fixing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
