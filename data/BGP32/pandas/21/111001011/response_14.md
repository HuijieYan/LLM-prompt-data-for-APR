### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a Series. It checks the type of the key and handles it accordingly. However, the bug seems to appear when the key is a list. The behavior differs when the key is a list compared to other types of keys like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.

#### Bug:
When the key is a list, the function tries to infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype()` and then proceeds to decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer (`iloc`) or label-based indexer (`loc`). However, this logic seems to go astray when the key is a list, resulting in an incorrect handling of the key type and indexing strategy.

#### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should adapt the logic for handling the key as a list. It should correctly identify whether to use `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type being a list. By handling the list key like other indexers, we can ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=True)
        else:
            key_type = "object"

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling the list key in a similar manner to other types of keys and correctly inferring the key type for a list, we can ensure the bug is fixed and the function behaves consistently for different types of indexers.
