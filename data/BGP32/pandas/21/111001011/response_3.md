### Potential Error Locations:
1. The section where `key_type` is being determined might be faulty due to the conditionals leading up to it.
2. The handling of different types of `key` variables may not be accurate, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of different types of `key` variables in the `_get_with` function. When processing certain types of keys, the function fails to correctly determine the `key_type`, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the determination of `key_type` is accurate based on the type of `key`.
2. Handle the various types of `key` variables correctly to avoid the issue observed in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the key_type determination issue and handles different types of `key` variables properly, aligning with the intended functionality of the function.
