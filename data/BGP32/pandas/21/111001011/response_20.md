### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers to retrieve values from a Series object. In the provided cases, we see that when the key is a list-like dtype (such as a list or ndarray), the function attempts to determine the key type to decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer or label-based indexer. However, in doing so, the key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, leading to the incorrect return path within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by incorrect inference of the key type as `'string'` regardless of the actual type of the key being passed. This incorrect type inference leads to the function returning the wrong result path.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to improve the key type inference logic to correctly identify the type of the key being passed. This will involve proper handling of list-like indexers to ensure the function behaves consistently and accurately for different types of key inputs.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to a proper Index object before further processing to improve the type inference mechanism and handle list-like indexers correctly. This should resolve the issue of incorrect type inference and ensure proper behavior based on the type of key being passed to the function.
