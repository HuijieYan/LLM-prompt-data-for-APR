### Bug Analysis
- The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is called with input parameters that are not handled correctly in the conditional branches.
- In the failing tests, the key input parameters are being handled incorrectly, leading to KeyError exceptions.
- The function is not properly distinguishing between different types of keys like lists, arrays, Index, and Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to refactor the function to correctly handle different types of keys, ensuring that the logic for each type is properly implemented.
- Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys, Index keys, and keys that are not list-like or scalar.

### Bug-Fixed Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, range)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Conclusion
The bug was fixed by properly handling different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. Now, the function should correctly handle list-like keys, Index keys, and other types of keys, preventing the KeyError exceptions observed in the failing tests.
