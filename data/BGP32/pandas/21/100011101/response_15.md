### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function should correctly determine the key type and select the appropriate indexing method based on that.

Looking at the error messages and the runtime values, it seems that the function is incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases. This incorrect inference is likely leading to incorrect indexing behavior and causing the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` call not correctly inferring the data type of the key in the specified cases. This leads to the function not selecting the correct indexing method based on the key type, resulting in incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should make sure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for different types of keys such as lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series. Based on the inferred type, the function should choose the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`).

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the `key_type` is correctly inferred and the appropriate indexing method is selected based on the key's type, this corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing tests with the expected input/output values.
