### Analysis
From the provided buggy function and the failing test cases, we can see that the function is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there seems to be an issue with how non-list-like keys are handled, resulting in a KeyError during indexing.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when `key` is a non-list-like object and a KeyError is raised during indexing. The function incorrectly tries to access `self.loc[key]` directly without proper handling, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle non-list-like keys that are not recognized by `is_list_like`. We can modify the function to ensure proper handling based on the key type.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Conclusion
By ensuring that non-list-like keys are properly handled and converted to lists if needed, the corrected function should now be able to handle different types of keys without raising a KeyError during indexing.
