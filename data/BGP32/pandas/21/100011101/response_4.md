The bug in the `_get_with()` function seems to be related to the incorrect handling of different types of input keys. The function should correctly handle various input types, such as lists, arrays, indexes, and series, to prevent the KeyError in the failing tests.

The issue arises from the code block where the type of the key is checked and processed. We need to ensure that the function properly handles the different input types and returns the expected output based on the input key type.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle different key types accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the different input types like lists, arrays, indexes, and series correctly, addressing the KeyError issues in the failing tests.
