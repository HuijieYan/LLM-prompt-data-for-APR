## Analysis
- The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
- In Case 1, the function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'`, leading to the incorrect execution path and causing a `KeyError`.
- The function doesn't handle the case where the key is a Series, which is causing the `KeyError` in the failing tests.
- The function should properly differentiate between different key types and handle them accordingly to prevent the `KeyError` and ensure correct indexing.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Add a condition to handle the case when the key is an instance of a Series.
2. Update the logic to correctly determine the key type and branch accordingly.
3. Ensure that appropriate indexing methods (`loc` or `iloc`) are used depending on the key type.
4. Make sure all key types are properly handled to avoid errors.

## Bug-fixed Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Series):  # New condition to handle key being a Series
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition `if isinstance(key, Series):`, we can now properly handle the case when the key is a Series and use `self.loc[key]` to index the Series. This should fix the `KeyError` issues in the failing tests.
