The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series, resulting in a KeyError when accessing the Series with these keys.

The bug arises from the conditional check for the type of the key and how it is handled. In the current implementation, the function does not correctly process the key when it is a list or array, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the function that deals with list-like keys. We will convert the key to a list if it's not already a list, array, Index, or Series, and then proceed with the proper indexing based on the key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version fixes the bug by handling list-like keys such as arrays, Index, and Series appropriately. It converts the key to a list if necessary before proceeding with the indexing operation. This fix should ensure that the function behaves correctly with the given inputs and passes the failing tests.
