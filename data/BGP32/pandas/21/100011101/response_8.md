### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of keys passed to it. Based on the error messages and runtime variables, it appears that the function is not handling certain key types correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the key.

1. In Case 1, the key is a list of strings, which should be valid for indexing the Series. However, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which should likely be `'object'`.
2. In Case 2, the key is an ndarray, which should also be a valid key for the given Series, but the function fails to handle it correctly.
3. In Case 3, the key is an Index object, and it seems to correctly infer the key type as `'string'`. However, the function still fails to process it properly.
4. In Case 4, the key is a Series object, and even though it should be a valid key, the function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles various types of keys that are passed to it for indexing the Series. This might involve updating the logic for determining the key type and ensuring that the key is processed appropriately based on its type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle different types of keys passed to it, allowing the Series to be indexed without causing a `KeyError`.
