### Bug Analysis:
The issue arises from the way the function handles different types of keys for indexing a Series. In all cases, the key is expected to be a label-based index, but due to the checks in the function, it incorrectly identifies the key as an integer type. This leads to the function trying to handle the key as a positional indexer when it should be treated as a label-based index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the logic in the function to correctly identify label-based indices and handle them accordingly. Specifically, we need to ensure that keys of types like list, ndarray, Series, and Index are treated as label-based indices.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Bug Fix Explanation:
- We first check if the key is a slice and handle it accordingly.
- If the key is a DataFrame, we raise a TypeError as specified.
- If the key is a tuple, we process it using `_get_values_tuple`.
- If the key is not list-like, we directly use label-based indexing with `self.loc`.
- Next, we check if the key is of types list, ndarray, Series, or Index, and directly use label-based indexing with `self.loc`.
- If the key is of integer type, we check whether to use label-based or positional indexing based on the index type.
- Finally, if none of the above conditions match, we reindex the Series with the key.
