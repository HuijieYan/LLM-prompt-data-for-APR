### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is not correctly handling the case where the key is a list. It is incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `'integer'` when it should be `'string'` (or any other type when the key is a list). This leads to the function trying to access the key as an index, causing a KeyError to be raised in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should adjust the logic in the function to correctly handle cases where the key is a list. We can modify the logic to treat list-like keys as labels for indexing instead of inferring them as integers. Additionally, we should ensure that the key type is correctly identified before performing any indexing operations to avoid KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        # Adjust key_type inference to consider list-like keys
        key_type = 'string' if lib.is_scalar(key) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list key with reindex
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected logic, we ensure that list-like keys are handled appropriately as labels for indexing, preventing any KeyError exceptions in the failing tests.
