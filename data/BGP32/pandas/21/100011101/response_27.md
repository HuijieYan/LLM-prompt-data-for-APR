### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` has a bug where it doesn't handle the case when the key is a list-like object properly. The function fails to check if the key is an Index, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or any other valid type. This results in the function not properly indexing into the Series when a key is provided in the listed formats.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test cases, the key is being converted to different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and passed to the `_get_with` function. However, the function does not accurately handle these types of keys. As a result, when trying to access an item in the Series using these keys, the function does not raise KeyError as expected because it fails to recognize these types of keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the function `_get_with` to properly handle different types of keys, specifically when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray. We can check the type of the key and then perform the appropriate action based on the type.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]

```

This corrected version of the function `_get_with` now properly handles different types of keys, ensuring that it can index into the Series correctly for various data types provided as keys.
