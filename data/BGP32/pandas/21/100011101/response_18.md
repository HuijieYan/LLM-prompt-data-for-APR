The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the check for the key type when it is not recognized by other conditionals. The function wrongly identifies the key type as `'string'` instead of handling list, numpy array, Index, Series, and ExtensionArray properly. 

To correct this bug, we need to handle each key type separately. If the key is a list, numpy array, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray, we should directly return the result of `self.loc[key]`. Otherwise, we should reindex the Series using `self.reindex(key)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle all types of keys that were failing the tests. It will return the correct values for list, numpy array, Index, Series, and ExtensionArray inputs, and reindex the Series for other unrecognized types of keys.
