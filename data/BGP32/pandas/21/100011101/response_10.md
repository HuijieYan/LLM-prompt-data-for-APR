The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is that it incorrectly identifies the type of the key input and does not handle it properly, leading to the KeyError in the failing tests. The function distinguishes between different types of keys but doesn't handle all cases correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys are handled appropriately. Specifically, in the failing tests, the key is of type `Index` or `ndarray`, which is not handled correctly in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the key is converted to an Index using `ensure_index`, we handle all types of keys correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and provide the expected output values for all cases.
