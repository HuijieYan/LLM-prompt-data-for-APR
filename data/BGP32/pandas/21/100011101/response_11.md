### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for a Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of key types and the determination of the `key_type` variable.
3. In all cases, the `key_type` variable is incorrectly assigned as `'string'` which is not a valid type. This suggests that the key type inference logic is failing.
4. The key type should be inferred correctly based on the type of input key provided.
5. The buggy function does not handle the case of input key being a Series object correctly, which leads to the error messages encountered in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred based on the input key provided.
2. Handle the case where the key input is a Series object appropriately.
3. Ensure that the function can handle different types of keys while maintaining the integrity of the Series indexing process.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(list(key))
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handle the case of a Series input key appropriately. This corrected function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior for different types of key inputs.
