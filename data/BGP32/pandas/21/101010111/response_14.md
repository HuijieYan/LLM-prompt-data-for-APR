### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, and list-like objects.
2. The failing tests are related to different types of key indexers like lists, arrays, and series objects.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexers of type `list`.
4. The expected behavior should be consistency in handling different types of indexers and properly handling the KeyError if the indexes are not found.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function, particularly when the indexer is of type `list`. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function consistently handles different types of indexers, including lists, arrays, and series objects. We can modify the logic to correctly handle the list indexer case and avoid the KeyError while maintaining consistency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
1. Added a step to convert the key to an Index using `ensure_index` to ensure consistency.
2. Handled the case when `key_type` is `'string'` to return values via `self.loc[key]`.
3. Updated the logic to resolve the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
4. The corrected version should now handle list-like objects properly and avoid the KeyError in the failing tests.
