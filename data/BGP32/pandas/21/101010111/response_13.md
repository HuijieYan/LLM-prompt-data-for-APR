### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, tuples, DataFrames, lists, etc. and returning the appropriate results based on the type of indexer.
2. The failing test is trying to index a Series with lists, arrays, Indexes, and Series, but the buggy function is not handling the list case correctly.
3. The failing test is expecting KeyError to be raised when indexing with a list, which is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled. The code inside the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block is trying to use `self.loc[key]`, but this is causing the test to fail with a different error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list is provided as an indexer, it should raise a KeyError similar to other types. This will align the behavior with other indexers and satisfy the failing test case.

### Correction:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the error handling for list-like indexers and raising KeyError when none of the items in the list are in the index, we align the behavior with other types of indexers and satisfy the failing test cases.
