### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of `key` values, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, single elements, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The failing test cases involve passing a `key` that is a list, an ndarray, and an Index. The function is not correctly handling these types of keys, leading to KeyError exceptions during the testing.
3. The bug seems related to the handling of different types of `key` values and the inconsistency in how they are processed within the function.
4. The `KeyError` exceptions indicate that the function is not able to find the provided key in the index, which is incorrect behavior for a list-like `key`.
5. The GitHub issue also highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated, specifically with respect to lists and Index objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that all types of indexes (list, ndarray, Index) are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function.
2. The function should correctly process and retrieve elements based on the provided key, without raising KeyError exceptions for valid cases.
3. We also need to address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue by aligning the behavior for list-like keys with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Ensured the key is always converted to an Index using `ensure_index` to handle consistency for list-like keys, ndarray, and Index objects.
2. Fixed the assignment of `key_type` based on the inferred dtype of the key before deciding on positional or label-based indexing.
3. Handled list indexers in a consistent way with other types to avoid KeyError exceptions for valid cases.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle different types of keys consistently and pass the failing test cases while aligning with the expectations specified for each case.
