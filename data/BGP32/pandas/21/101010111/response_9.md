After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, we can see that the bug occurs when a Series is indexed with a list-like object. The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle this case correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` during the test execution.

The cause of the bug lies in how the function handles the different types of indexers. When a list-like object is passed as an indexer, the function incorrectly expects either a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. This leads to a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like object that is not recognized as one of the expected types.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like objects as indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like objects
    key_as_list = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_as_list, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key_as_list]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key_as_list]

    # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key_as_list]
```

By adding the `key_as_list = ensure_index(key)` line and modifying the subsequent code to use `key_as_list` instead of `key`, we ensure that a list-like object is correctly handled as an indexer in the `_get_with` function. This modification aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the `KeyError` issue during the test execution.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for the given scenarios.
