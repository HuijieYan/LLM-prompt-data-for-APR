### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is meant to handle various types of keys, but there is a bug in the part where it tries to use a list-like key to index the series.
2. The error occurs when passing a list-like key to index the series, causing a `KeyError` in the test due to inconsistencies in behavior.
3. The key issue causing the bug is related to the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with array-like keys to avoid the KeyError and maintain a uniform behavior across different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the part of the code handling list-like keys to ensure consistent behavior with array-like keys.
2. Implement the necessary adjustments to address the issue raised in the GitHub report and pass the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string', 'mixed-integer']:
        # Align with behavior for other types
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version, the `_get_with` function now handles list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, thus resolving the KeyError issue and aligning the behavior with the expected results from the failing test cases.
