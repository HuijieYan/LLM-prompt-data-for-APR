### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, Series, and Index.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling list indexers correctly compared to other array-like indexers.
3. The core issue seems to be the inconsistent behavior when handling list key inputs. The failing test expects consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
4. The current implementation seems to favor data consistency when working with list indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The function `_get_with` does not treat list indexers the same way it treats other array-like indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. We can achieve this by treating list indexers in the same way as we treat other array-like indexers and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectations from the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        # handling the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version above, the function `_get_with` now treats list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency identified in the failing test cases.
