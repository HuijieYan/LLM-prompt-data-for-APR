## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
2. The failing test cases are testing the behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`).
3. The failing test cases are failing because the `_get_with` function is not handling the case of `list` indexers correctly. The function should treat all types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) consistently.
4. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not raised as expected when indexing a Series with a list indexer.
5. The expected behavior is that all types of indexers should return consistent results for cases where no matches are found in the index.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs in the case of indexing a Series with a `list` indexer in the `_get_with` function.
- The function currently doesn't handle the case of a `list` indexer properly, which causes the inconsistency in behavior.
- The buggy function should treat all types of indexers consistently to ensure that the expected behavior is maintained.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the `_get_with` function to treat all types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) consistently when no matches are found in the index.
- Specifically, when dealing with a `list` indexer, the function should return a `KeyError` when no matches are found in the index.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key] if any(self.index[_] not in self.index for _ in key) else self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing these changes, we ensure that the `_get_with` function handles all types of indexers consistently and accurately returns a `KeyError` when no matches are found in the index for `list` indexers.
