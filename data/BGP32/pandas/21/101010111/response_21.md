### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is incorrectly handling different types of key inputs.
2. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not raised when using a list as a key for indexing.
3. The function is supposed to distinguish between different types of keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other iterable objects. However, the handling of lists seems to be incorrect, resulting in the failure to raise a `KeyError` in certain cases.
4. The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent handling of key types within the `_get_with` function, which leads to improper indexing behavior when a list is used as the key.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic for handling lists as keys to ensure that the behavior is consistent with other key types and properly raises a `KeyError` when needed.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"Some keys in {key} are not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to check if `key` is a scalar or a single element list before performing element-wise checks, we can ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when a key is not present in the index, thus resolving the bug and aligning the behavior with other key types.
