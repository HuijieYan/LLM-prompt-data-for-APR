### Potential Error Locations:
1. The if statement checking if `key` is not list-like may not correctly determine the proper action to take.
2. Differentiating between different types of indexers (list, np.ndarray, Index) could be causing inconsistencies in behavior.
3. Handling of key types and determining `key_type` might lead to unexpected outcomes.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when using a list key to access a Series, resulting in a KeyError even when the key is present in the index. When passing a list key, the current implementation results in an error that states the key is not in the index, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function correctly identifies different key types (list, np.ndarray, Index) and processes them consistently.
2. Check the handling of non-list-like keys to prevent incorrect actions.
3. Verify the determination of `key_type` to ensure accurate indexing behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # All other cases where key is list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case if key is a list
    return self.loc[key]
```

By ensuring all key types are handled consistently and accurately determining the `key_type`, this corrected function should address the issue and pass the failing test cases.
