### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs when indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
2. The failing tests indicate that the buggy function does not handle a key input as a list appropriately, leading to a `KeyError` exception when attempting to index the Series with a list key.
3. The expected behavior is that indexing a Series with a list key should return `NaN` for non-matching elements, similar to how indexing with other types of keys behaves.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers, calling for a uniform behavior for all types of indexers.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of a list key input within the `_get_with` function of the Series class. The bug leads to a `KeyError` exception when trying to index the Series with a list key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a list key is handled correctly within the `_get_with` function. The correction should align the behavior of list indexers with other array-like indexers, ensuring uniform output when indexing a Series.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        result = self.loc[key]  # Try locating with the list key
        if isinstance(result, Series):
            return result.fillna(np.nan)  # Fill NaN for non-matching elements
        return result

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above modifications, the corrected function should now handle list keys correctly, returning `NaN` for non-matching elements, and resolving the issue identified in the GitHub thread.
