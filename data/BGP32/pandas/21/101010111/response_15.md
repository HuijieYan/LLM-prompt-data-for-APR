### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various array-like objects.
2. The failing tests indicate that when using a list-like indexer, the function is not handling it correctly, causing a KeyError to be raised.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are processed properly and consistently with other array-like indexers, following the expected functionality mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional logic for handling indexers to provide consistent treatment for list-like and other array-like indexers.
2. Specifically, for list-like indexers, the function should locate the values based on the provided list rather than converting it to a different type of indexer.
3. Ensure that the changes align with the expected behavior discussed in the GitHub issue to maintain consistent indexing behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "string", "object"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported type for indexing: {type(key).__name__}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying the corrections, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the issue with KeyError raised during the tests.
