### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key input to retrieve values from a Series object.
2. The failing test cases are attempting to index a Series object using different types of keys: list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` is raised when using a List type key.
4. The expected input/output values are provided for each test case, and the bug seems to be related to the handling of List type keys.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with list key compared to other types of key inputs.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling a List type key. The function mishandles List keys by attempting to return `self.loc[key]` directly, leading to the `KeyError` because the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. When dealing with List type keys, check if the key is present in the index and raise a `KeyError` if not found.
2. Modify the code to check the key type and handle List keys differently from other types of keys to ensure consistency.
3. Use the correct method for retrieving values based on the key type provided.

### Code Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for List type key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

By adding the check for List type keys and specifically handling them to avoid the `KeyError`, the bug should be fixed. This approach ensures consistent behavior when indexing a Series object with different types of keys.
