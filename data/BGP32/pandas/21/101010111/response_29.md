Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function stems from how list-like indexers are handled differently from other types such as ndarray, Index, or Series. The issue occurs when trying to access a Series using a list indexer, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

### Error Identification:
1. The bug arises due to the discrepancy in handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
2. The behavior for ndarray, Index, and Series indexers is consistent, but it differs for list indexers.
3. The failing tests highlight the KeyError when using list-like indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and maintain consistency in handling different types of indexers, we need to modify the logic for list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated handling for list-like indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Simplified handling for list indexers to maintain consistency
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` for list-like indexers and directly calling `self.reindex(key)`, the corrected function ensures that list indexers are processed consistently with other types of indexers. This fix should resolve the bug and pass the failing tests.
