### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_with(key)` within the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers (`key`) and return the appropriate values based on the type. The error seems related to cases where the `key` is a list. The function contains multiple conditional statements to determine the type of the `key` and handle it accordingly.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely related to how the function handles indexing when the `key` is a list.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug leads to a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list, as seen in the failing test case. The bug seems to be related to inconsistent behavior when the `key` is a list compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers (`key`) consistently with other types of indexers. We need to ensure that key errors are avoided when indexing with a list.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function within the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # handle the case when key is a list
    if len(key) == 0:
        return self.loc[""]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version includes handling the case when the `key` is a list by checking its length. If the list is empty, it returns the location with an empty string, otherwise, it continues to use `loc` with the `key`.

By implementing this correction, the function should now handle list indexers consistently and resolve the `KeyError` issue seen in the failing test cases.
