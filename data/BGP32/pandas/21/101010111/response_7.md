### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases indicate that there is inconsistency in the behavior of indexing when using lists compared to other indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.
3. The function seems to handle key types such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, and various list-like objects.
4. The bug appears to be related to the handling of list-like objects in the `key` parameter.
5. The expected behavior is consistency in handling different indexer types.

### Bug Cause:
- When indexing with a list-like object (`is_list_like(key)` condition), the function incorrectly tries to handle the key as if it was an Index object, leading to the KeyError in the failing test cases.
- The bug is in the section where the function attempts to convert the `key` to a list when it's not an instance of (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index).

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the code to handle list-like objects appropriately without converting them into a list unnecessarily. 
- Ensure that the behavior of indexing with list-like objects is consistent with other types of indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Reindex only when necessary
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Fallback to loc for direct single-element access
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that indexing with list-like objects is handled consistently with other types of indexers, avoiding unnecessary conversions that could cause KeyError.
