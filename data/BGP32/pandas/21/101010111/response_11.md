### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs and performing specific actions based on the key type.
2. The failing test cases involve passing a key of various types (list, ndarray, Index) to the `ser[key]` operation, resulting in a `KeyError`.
3. The bug originates from how the key type is handled within the `_get_with` function, leading to inconsistent behavior for list indexers as compared to array-like indexers.
4. The bug is related to how list indexers are processed differently from array-like indexers, causing unexpected KeyError exceptions in certain cases.
5. To fix the bug, the handling of different types of key inputs needs to be unified to ensure consistent behavior across all types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle key inputs consistently for all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
2. Ensure that the `KeyError` is not raised for any specific index type by aligning the behavior for different key types.
3. Update the logic to correctly process and return the result based on the key type provided.
4. Use appropriate type checking and conversions to maintain uniform behavior for all indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Unify handling of key types to avoid KeyError for any specific index type
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug causing inconsistent behavior for different key types should be resolved. The corrected function ensures that list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers are handled uniformly, avoiding unexpected `KeyError` exceptions in specific cases.
