## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexer keys and return the corresponding values from the Series.
2. The failing test cases indicate that when using a list-like key as an indexer, the function is not returning the expected values and causing a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type, including handling Index, numpy arrays, and Series, but it seems to handle list-like keys incorrectly.
4. The `_convert_slice_indexer` method might be crucial in determining the proper behavior for different types of keys.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the `_get_with` function. The function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to an incorrect key being used to access the index, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Fix Strategy
Update the section of the function that handles list-like keys to ensure they are processed correctly and the correct values are returned from the Series.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is converted to Index
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list-like keys are converted to an Index type before accessing the Series, the corrected version of the function should now handle list-like keys properly, addressing the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test cases.
