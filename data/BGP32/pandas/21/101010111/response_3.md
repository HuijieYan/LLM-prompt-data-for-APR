## Analysis and Solution

### Issue:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle list indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` in the failing test cases when using a list as an indexer.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely in the logic that handles different types of key inputs and how they are processed within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. The function treats lists differently, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to index using a list.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should modify the logic related to list indexers to align it with other types of indexers and avoid the `KeyError` in the failing test cases.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic pertaining to list indexers, the corrected function should now handle list-based indexing consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue in the failing test cases. This fix aligns with the mentioned GitHub issue regarding the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
