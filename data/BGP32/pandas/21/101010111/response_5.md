### Analyzing the buggy function and related functions
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, data frames, tuples, etc.
2. The failing test cases involve passing different types of key/index to a `Series` object and expecting a `KeyError` to be raised if the index doesn't match. The actual behavior seems inconsistent among different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like indexers, causing the `KeyError` to not be raised when it should.
4. The related GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when passing different types of indexers to a `Series` object.

### Bug identification and cause
The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to the `_get_with` function. The function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in the `KeyError` not being raised, which leads to the test failure.

### Bug fixing strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled properly in the `_get_with` function. The function should raise a `KeyError` when the index does not match for list-like indexers.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these modifications, the `_get_with` function should handle list-like indexers correctly and raise a `KeyError` if the index does not match. This corrected version is expected to resolve the failing test cases and the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
