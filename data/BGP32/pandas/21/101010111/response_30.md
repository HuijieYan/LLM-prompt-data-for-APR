### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. When the input key is a list-like object, the function erroneously fails to handle it correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The problem arises due to different treatment of key indexers - list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The expected behavior is to treat these indexers uniformly, but the current implementation has a discrepancy in how lists are handled. This discrepancy leads to inconsistencies and errors, as highlighted in the failing test cases and the associated GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key indexers correctly. The function should treat all indexers (list, ndarray, Index, and Series) uniformly, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all list-like indexers uniformly
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as positional indexer (self.iloc) or label-based (self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the key indexing logic and ensuring that all types of key indexers are handled consistently, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
