### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different operations based on its type, including handling slices, data frames, tuples, and various index arrays.
2. The failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list.
3. The error message indicates that when `key` is a list, the function fails to handle it properly and raises a `KeyError` as none of the items in the list are found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are treated, leading to the failing test.
4. The bug arises from the conditional branches in the function that handle the `key` parameter. The function should treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for handling list indexers to align with how other array-like indexers are treated.
2. Ensure that list indexers are correctly processed to avoid raising a `KeyError` when items in the list are not found in the index.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list indexers the same as other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list indexers to align with other array-like indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub related to the inconsistent behavior of different indexers.
