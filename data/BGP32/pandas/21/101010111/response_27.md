### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys and performing indexing operations on a Series object.
2. The error message indicates that when using a list as a key to index a Series, a `KeyError` is raised, leading to a failing test.
3. The bug seems to be related to how different types of key inputs are treated within the `_get_with` function. It fails for cases where the key is a list.
4. The cause of the bug is related to inconsistent behavior for different types of indexers (array-like vs. list-like). The issue on GitHub points out this inconsistency.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers behave consistently with array-like indexers and do not raise a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a similar way to how it handles array-like keys, avoiding the `KeyError` issue.
2. Ensure that the function correctly determines the `key_type` for list-like keys and performs the appropriate indexing operation.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as provided above, we address the key error issue related to inconsistent behavior for list-like indexers. The corrected function should now pass the failing tests and maintain consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
