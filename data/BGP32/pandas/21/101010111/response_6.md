### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` to retrieve values from the `Series` object.
2. The failing test is related to the issue of inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.).
3. The bug occurs due to the different treatment of indexers where a list key results in a `KeyError`, while other types of indexers do not.
4. The buggy function incorrectly handles the cases when `key` is a list, causing the test to fail with a `KeyError`.
5. The fix should ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to the inconsistent behavior.

### Correction Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_with` function to consistently handle different types of input `key` by managing the list key case properly.
2. Ensure that the function follows the correct logic for indexing a `Series` object with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
3. Adjust the behavior to align with the expectations of the failing test and address the issue raised on GitHub related to inconsistent behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the `_get_with` function as shown above, the issues with inconsistent handling of indexers, specifically when `key` is a list, should be resolved. The corrected function should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values, addressing the GitHub issue related to this bug.
