The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when `key` is a list-like object but not recognized as a scalar. The buggy code tries to access elements of `self` using `key` directly without considering that `key` might not be a valid index for `self`. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to use `key` for indexing `self.loc`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list-like object but not recognized as a scalar properly. We can modify the code to first check if `key` is an index or a list of indexes and then use `reindex` to handle the situation appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.reindex(key)  # Use reindex for list-like keys

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function first checks if `key` is an `Index`, a list, or a numpy array. If so, it directly uses `reindex` to handle the indexing. If `key` is not recognized as an index, it falls back to using `loc` for scalar indexing.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
