## Analysis:
1. The `is_list_like(key)` condition is checking if the key is not a list-like object, which is intended to handle scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. However, the subsequent operations within the condition block are incorrect for handling scalar values.
2. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of scalar values within the `if not is_list_like(key)` block.
3. The bug is likely leading to an incorrect path within the function, resulting in unexpected behavior when handling scalar values for indexing.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of scalars within the `if not is_list_like(key)` block. The code within this block is assuming that scalars should be handled as individual index lookup operations (`self.loc[key]`). However, this assumption is incorrect and leads to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle scalar values within the `if not is_list_like(key)` block. Scalars should be treated as is, without any further index lookup operations. We can achieve this by returning the scalar directly in this case.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Return the scalar without further processing
        return key

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By returning the scalar directly within the `if not is_list_like(key)` block, we can ensure correct handling of scalar values for indexing operations in the Series class.
