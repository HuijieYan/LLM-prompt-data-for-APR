## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. When the function is called with certain types of keys (like a single-element array or Index), it incorrectly handles the key and tries to retrieve it by calling `self.loc[key]`. This results in a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the key types in the `_get_with` function. When the key is not recognized as a list-like type, the function incorrectly assumes it can be directly used with `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of key types in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should check if the key is a list-like type before using it with `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not list-like, we should handle it differently to avoid the KeyError.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle different types of keys and avoid the KeyError that occurred before.
