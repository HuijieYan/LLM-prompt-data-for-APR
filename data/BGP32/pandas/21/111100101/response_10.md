### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series, but the bug is likely due to incorrectly handling the case where the key is of type `Index`. The current implementation does not correctly identify the type of key when it is an `Index`, leading to incorrect behavior and raising issues like `KeyError`.

### Bug Explanation
- When the key is of type `Index`, the current implementation does not correctly identify this and ends up inferring the key type as 'integer' instead of correctly handling it as 'Index'.
- This leads to the function choosing the wrong path for indexing (using `loc` instead of `iloc` or vice versa) and ultimately resulting in incorrect behavior when trying to index the Series with the key.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key when it is an `Index` and handle it appropriately in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of key to avoid the `KeyError` raised in the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now correctly handle the input key of type `Index` and follow the appropriate indexing method based on the key type. This fix should ensure that the failing test cases pass as expected.
