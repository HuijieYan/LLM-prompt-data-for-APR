### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. However, there is a bug in the function where the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred, leading to incorrect indexing logic later in the function. The function is not handling the case where the key is a single element Series correctly, causing a KeyError in the test case. 

### Bug in the code:
The bug arises when the `key_type` is inferred as `'integer'`, but the key should have been treated as a string. This leads to incorrect indexing logic and the KeyError in the failing test case.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where the key is a single element Series with dtype `'object'`. The key should be treated as a string in this case to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = np.asarray(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if len(key) == 1 and key[0] in self.index:
        return self.loc[key[0]]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of the fix:
- I modified the logic to convert the key into a numpy array when dealing with list-like inputs to ensure consistent handling.
- I moved the `key_type` inference after handling different input types to ensure that the key's type is correctly identified.
- I added a check for single element keys that are present in the index to return the corresponding value using `.loc` to fix the KeyError issue in the failing test case.
