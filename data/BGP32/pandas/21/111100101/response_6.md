## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing the Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input key types and the determination of the `key_type` variable, which is used to decide whether to treat the key as positional or label-based in indexing.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` provides a Series object with values `['A', 'B']` and tries to index it with a key `['C']` which is not present in the index. The bug in the `_get_with` function leads to a `KeyError` instead of the appropriate handling of the missing key.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the key type by the `_get_with` function. When the key is not found in the index, the function should ideally raise a `KeyError` to indicate the missing key. However, the current implementation doesn't handle this scenario properly and raises the `KeyError` prematurely due to incorrect key type identification.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify the key correctly and determine its type for indexing.
2. Handle the case where the key is not found in the index and raise a `KeyError` with an appropriate message.
3. Ensure that the key is processed correctly and the function returns the expected behavior for missing keys.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check if key is not present in the index
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    
    # Determine the type of key for indexing
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle indexing with scalar keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the key identification and adding a check for missing keys, the corrected function should now handle the failing test case and return the expected behavior when indexing a Series object.
