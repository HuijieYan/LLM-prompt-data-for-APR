### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys passed to a Series object for indexing. The bug is likely located in the section where the key type is determined and the corresponding action is taken based on that type. It seems that there may be a mismatch in the handling of the key types.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test case, the key is a Series object containing the value "C". The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError with the message indicating that the key is not in the index.
2. The bug in the current implementation may be related to how the key type is inferred and how the indexing (using `loc` or `iloc`) is determined based on the key type.
3. It seems that the current implementation might not be handling the key type correctly, which leads to incorrect indexing behavior and fails the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and the corresponding indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is applied accordingly. We should also account for scenarios where the key type is a Series object.
Furthermore, we need to handle the case where the key is not present in the index and raise a KeyError as expected in the failing test case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.__getitem__(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

```

By making the corrections as suggested above, the function should now correctly handle the different key types and index the Series object accordingly. This corrected version is expected to pass the failing test case.
