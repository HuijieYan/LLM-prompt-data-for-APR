### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different indexer types (list, ndarray, Index) within the `_get_with` function of the Series class. When the input key is of type list, the function attempts to handle it in various ways based on its type, leading to unexpected behavior.

In the provided runtime scenarios:
- Case 1, Case 2, Case 3: The function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'` even though the key is a list, ndarray, and Index.
- Case 4: The same incorrect identification of key type as `'string'` occurs even when the key is a Series instance.

This inconsistency results in the function not handling list, ndarray, and Index keys appropriately, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to appropriately handle list, ndarray, and Index keys. This can be achieved by ensuring consistent treatment of these key types and appropriate action based on their specific characteristics.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now explicitly handle the different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index) in a more consistent manner.
- If the key is list-like and not an ndarray or Index, it is converted to a list for further processing.
- The function appropriately determines the key type based on Index or inferred type from lib.infer_dtype.
- The bug causing incorrect identification of key type should be resolved with this corrected implementation.
