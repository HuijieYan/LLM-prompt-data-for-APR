The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic for handling different types of key inputs. Specifically, the problem arises when dealing with list-like key inputs where the type inference is incorrect, leading to the wrong path being taken in the subsequent code execution.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys to ensure proper inference and appropriate indexing based on the inferred type.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle different types of key inputs
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the fixed version:
1. We ensure the key is converted to an Index type using `ensure_index`.
2. Correctly determine the key type.
3. Handle list-like keys appropriately to enable correct indexing based on the inferred type.

These adjustments address the inconsistencies with different key inputs and effectively resolve the issue described in the GitHub thread.
