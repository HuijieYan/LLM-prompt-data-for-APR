### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to originate from the incorrect handling of the key type and its inference.
3. The bug leads to incorrect type inference (`key_type = 'string'`) regardless of the actual data type of the key, causing wrong execution paths in the function.
4. The issue from GitHub points out the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, which further confirms the presence of a bug in the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function stems from incorrect inference of the type of the key, leading to incorrect execution paths and responses to different types of keys. This results in the inaccurate processing of indexers, as demonstrated by the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the type inference for the key should be corrected to accurately represent the data type being used for indexing. This will ensure that the correct execution path is chosen based on the type of the key.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = None

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that the key type is accurately inferred, which then determines the correct course of action based on the type of the key being used for indexing. This should resolve the bug and address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
