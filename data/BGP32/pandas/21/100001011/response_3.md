### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to access elements from a Series using different types of indexers. The function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling the various types of indexes and fetching the corresponding values. The bug is related to how different indexers are treated inconsistently, causing errors in certain scenarios.

### Error Locations
1. The code path handling `Index` type indexers.
2. The `key_type` inference logic for different types of indexers.
3. The conditional logic for deciding whether to use `iloc` or `loc` based on the index type.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes inconsistent behavior when accessing elements from a Series using different types of indexers, leading to errors or unexpected results. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of `Index` type indexers and the inconsistent treatment in the type inference logic for different indexer types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers, especially `Index` type indexers. Additionally, the type inference logic should be revised for improved consistency.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle Index type indexer specifically
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Convert non-Index type indexers to a list for consistent handling
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes specific handling for `Index` type indexers, ensuring they are processed correctly. Additionally, the code path for type inference and decision-making between `iloc` and `loc` has been adjusted for improved consistency.
