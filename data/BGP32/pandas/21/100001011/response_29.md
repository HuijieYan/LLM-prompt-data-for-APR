### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The bug seems to arise when handling key inputs that are in list format, leading to incorrect behavior and errors in some cases. The runtime value analysis of the key variable and its type, along with other relevant variables, indicates inconsistencies in handling list-like key inputs, resulting in failures.

### Potential Error Location
The issue most likely arises in the block handling list-like keys, where the conditions might not be appropriately evaluated, leading to undesired behavior.

### Bug Cause
1. In Case 1, 2, and 3, the key_type is identified as 'string' for different key types, which should not happen based on the provided input.
2. The key_type being 'string' indicates that the type inference (`lib.infer_dtype` function) is not correctly identifying the key types.
3. The issue from the GitHub report suggests a discrepancy in behavior when indexing with list-like keys, which aligns with the observed failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function's key type inference mechanism needs to correctly identify the types of list-like keys and handle them consistently with other key types. Adjustments in the conditions and type inference logic might be necessary to ensure correct indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key_type = 'list'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes adjustments in determining the key_type for list-like keys and ensuring that the function handles list-like keys consistently with other key types when indexing the Series object.
