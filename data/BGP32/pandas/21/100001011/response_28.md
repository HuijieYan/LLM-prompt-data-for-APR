The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of key types, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys. Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided in the failing tests, we can identify the issue in the function's logic.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In all the cases provided, the key_type is identified as `'string'`, which indicates a mismatch in inferring the key type correctly. This incorrect key type inference leads to improper handling of the key in subsequent operations.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the key type is correctly inferred to determine the appropriate indexing method (positional or label-based). This will prevent unexpected behavior when indexing with different key types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Ensure correct key type inference
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index` to correctly infer the key type and incorporating additional checks for list-like keys, the corrected version of the function addresses the issue of inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series.
