### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because there is inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list and is passed through `self.loc[key]`, it may not return the expected result or raise an error. This behavior is not in alignment with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, leading to the failure of the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent across different scenarios as described in the GitHub issue. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it should return the same results as when array-like indexers are used. We can modify the function to treat list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers to achieve consistency.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle list indexers in a similar way as array-like indexers, we ensure consistency and correct behavior as per the GitHub issue.
