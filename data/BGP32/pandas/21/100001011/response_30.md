### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of input keys like slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc., for indexing a Series object. However, there is inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, leading to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
The bug arises when the key is of type `list`. The handling of the list key is causing the issue due to inconsistency in comparison with other types like arrays or indexes.

### Bug Cause
When the key is a list, the code path being followed leads to an incorrect return value due to the internal logic for list indexers being inconsistent with other types. This inconsistency causes the failing tests and triggers the bug described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy
The fix involves handling list indexers consistently with array-like indexers to address the reported bug. By ensuring that the logic for list keys aligns with other types of keys, the issue can be resolved.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers, the corrected version of the function resolves the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
