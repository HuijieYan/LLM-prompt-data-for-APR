### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series` file. The function has conditional blocks to handle different types of input `key`, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and others. The bug seems to be related to how lists are treated differently compared to other indexers like arrays or `Index` objects.

### Error Location
The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list. The function tries to handle lists differently than arrays or `Index` objects, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
Based on the runtime values and types provided, the bug seems to stem from the inconsistent handling of list-like `key` inputs where key_type is determined to be `'string'`. This causes the function to potentially reindex and return incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list-like `key` inputs is consistent with the treatment of other array-like or `Index` objects. By unifying the approach for all types of indexers, we can provide a more robust and predictable behavior.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling list-like `key` inputs has been unified with the approach for other array-like or `Index` objects. This change should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and provide a more consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
