### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs due to a discrepancy in how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the Series class in pandas. The key issue is that list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistent behavior. The code attempts to distinguish between various types of key inputs, but the handling logic is not harmonized.

1. In cases where the key is a list, the code attempts to detect the type of key and make decisions based on that. However, when the key is a list, the handling logic differs compared to when the key is an array or an Index.

2. The code aims to determine the key type and decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer or a label-based indexer, but the logic is not consistent across different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to harmonize the handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. The goal is to have consistent behavior regardless of whether the key is a list, an array, or an Index. We can simplify the logic to ensure that all types of indexers are handled uniformly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We removed the specific handling for different key types and unified the logic to convert all types to a list if needed.
- Arrays, extension arrays, series, and indexes are treated uniformly by using `loc` for these key types.
- The key type is inferred correctly to determine whether to use `loc` or `iloc` based on the dtype.
- The code should now have consistent behavior for all types of indexers, addressing the GitHub issue and fixing the bug.
