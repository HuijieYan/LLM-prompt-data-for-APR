### Error Identification
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of key indexers. The function incorrectly assumes the key type to be "integer" when it can be of different types like strings or objects. This issue leads to incorrect reindexing or selection methods, disrupting the functionality of the function.

### Bug Cause
In all the runtime cases provided, the `key_type` is determined as a string, which is an incorrect evaluation. The function should handle string-type keys differently from integer-type keys to ensure correct indexing or reindexing operations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` passed to the function. By properly identifying the key type as a string or object, we can appropriately select the reindexing or selection method. This will resolve the inconsistencies in handling different key types.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `key_type` determination logic to infer based on the actual type of the `key` parameter, the corrected function will now handle different key types appropriately, resolving the bug causing the inconsistencies in indexing or reindexing operations.
