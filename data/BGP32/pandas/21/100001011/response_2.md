### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs to retrieve values from a Series object. However, there are inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other types. The key issue revolves around the `key_type` determination and the subsequent actions based on it.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely resides in the `key_type` determination and the conditional block that follows, particularly in handling list indexers differently.

### Bug Cause:
1. In cases where a list input is provided, the `key` may not be recognized as an `Index` type, leading to incorrect inference of `key_type` as `'integer'` instead of `'string'`. This results in the incorrect path taken, causing the bug.
2. The inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types might be causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the determination of `key_type` is accurate for all types of indexers to follow the correct path.
2. Align the handling of list indexers to be consistent with other input types to resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the bug analysis and fix strategy:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers while accurately determining the `key_type`.
