The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where `key` is a list correctly. Based on the provided runtime values and types, the bug seems to be in the following section of the code:
```python
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key] # Issue here for list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
```

The bug causes an issue when `key` is a list because the function incorrectly assumes it should be handled as a scalar value. The bug originates from the discrepancy in how different types of indexers are handled, as identified in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the case when `key` is a list and treat it similar to array-like indexers. Here is the corrected version of `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)  # Corrected to handle list case

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `key` is a list and handles it within the array-like indexers' condition to maintain consistency with the handling of different indexers as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This fix should resolve the issue and align the behavior with the expected output.
