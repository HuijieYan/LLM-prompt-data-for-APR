### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from how different types of key indexers are handled. Specifically, when a key indexer is a list-like object, the function behaves differently based on whether the input key is an `Index`, `np.ndarray`, `list`, or other types. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and errors when attempting to retrieve values from the Series.

### Bug Location
The bug location in the code is primarily in the handling of different key types where the logic is not consistent. The issue comes from the multiple conditional blocks that treat the key differently without a coherent strategy for all types of key indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug and make the function behavior consistent irrespective of the key indexer type, a unified approach needs to be adopted to handle key indexers. The strategy would involve streamlining the handling of key types to ensure a consistent output is produced regardless of the input key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug by simplifying the key indexer handling to ensure consistency in the output:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the handling of the key indexers has been simplified and unified to produce a consistent result regardless of the input type. This approach aims to eliminate the inconsistencies that lead to unexpected behavior and errors when using different key indexers.
