### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is primarily responsible for handling various types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The function differentiates between slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list-like, integer, and other types of keys to perform the indexing operation accordingly. The bug seems to occur when dealing with keys that are lists. The function encounters issues in determining the appropriate indexing method when the key is a list type.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-type keys within the function.
2. Inappropriate key_type determination.
3. Reindexing operation when encountering a list key.

### Bug Cause:
When indexing a Series object with a list of keys, the function fails to correctly handle the specific case of a list key. This inconsistency results in the incorrect determination of the key_type, leading to potential errors in the subsequent indexing operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, it is essential to address the handling of list-type keys and ensure that the key_type is correctly determined to perform the indexing operation accurately. Adjusting the indexing method according to the key type will help resolve the issue and make the function more robust.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Determine key type correctly
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types appropriately
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the handling of list-type keys and ensuring the accurate determination of key_type, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
