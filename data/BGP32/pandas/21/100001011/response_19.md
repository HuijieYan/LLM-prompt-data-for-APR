The issue arises due to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using different types of keys, where the list key results in a KeyError while other types of keys do not. This inconsistency in handling the key input causes unexpected behavior and confusion for users.

The bug arises in the buggy function `_get_with` when processing the key input. In particular, the issue stems from the handling of non-list-like key inputs, which leads to the incorrect return type for `key_type`. This incorrect key type determination then affects the subsequent branching logic in the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the key type determination should be adjusted to handle different types of keys correctly, ensuring consistency in how the Series is indexed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensuring key is in proper Index format

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key is treated consistently, and the key type determination is correct before proceeding with indexing. By ensuring that all types of keys are handled properly, the function should align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub bug.
