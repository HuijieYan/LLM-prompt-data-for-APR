### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for indexing operations in a Series object. However, it fails to handle certain types of indexers correctly, as indicated by the GitHub issue. In particular, when indexing with a list containing no matches, the function raises an error instead of returning a NaN value as it does with other types.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block for handling indexers that are not list-like might be causing the issue.
2. Another potential source of error could be related to how the inferred type of the key is determined.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When using a list indexer with no matches, the function does not return NaN as expected but instead raises a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and align the behavior with the GitHub issue's expectation, we should ensure that list-based indexers handle cases with no matches by returning NaN instead of raising an error. This modification will harmonize the behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when indexing with a list containing no matches, the function will return NaN instead of raising an error, complying with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
