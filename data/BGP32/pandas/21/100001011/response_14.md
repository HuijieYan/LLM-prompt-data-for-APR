### Analyzing the Bug and Identifying Errors
1. The `_get_with` function is trying to handle different types of key inputs, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list-like scalars, and various array-like objects.
2. The bug occurs when processing a key that is a list. The function mistakenly treats the key as not list-like because it checks for instances of Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index but does not explicitly handle lists.
3. The cause of the bug is the incomplete check for list-like keys, leading to incorrect processing of lists in the function, which results in unexpected behavior and errors.
4. To fix the bug, we need to explicitly check for list-like keys and handle them accordingly to ensure consistency in how different types of indexers are processed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add a specific check for list-like keys to properly handle them.
2. Update the function to correctly process list-like keys following the same logic applied to other array-like indexers.
3. Ensure that the function can handle various types of key inputs consistently to align with expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle list-like keys here

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function explicitly checks for list-like keys and handles them before proceeding with other checks to ensure consistent behavior with different types of indexers. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and aligns the function's behavior with expectations.
