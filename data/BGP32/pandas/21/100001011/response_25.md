### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to the following reasons:
1. The function `_get_with` in the pandas core series module is not handling the key types appropriately for dealing with various indexers.
2. The function is inconsistent in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors when dealing with certain indexers.
3. The code is not efficiently distinguishing between different types of key input (list, array, Index) and not providing consistent behavior for each case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Ensure uniform treatment of different types of key input (list, array, Index).
2. Modify the key handling logic to provide consistent behavior and prevent errors related to non-matching indexes.
3. Update the function to correctly categorize the key types and handle them accordingly to achieve the desired functionality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        keys = list(key)
    else:
        keys = [key]

    if isinstance(keys, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = type(keys[0]).__name__
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(keys, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "int":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[keys]
        else:
            return self.iloc[keys]

    if isinstance(keys, list):
        return self.loc[keys]

    return self.reindex(keys)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Ensured proper categorization and handling of different key types (list, array, Index).
2. Converted all key inputs into a list for consistent processing.
3. Obtained the type of the keys list correctly to determine the key type.
4. Adjusted the handling of integer keys to differentiate between positional and label-based indexing.
5. Updated the logic to correctly reindex keys and avoid errors related to non-matching indexes.
