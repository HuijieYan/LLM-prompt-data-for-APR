### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the pandas source code deals with different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers, particularly with lists, arrays, and Index objects.
3. The function logic branches based on the type of `key` parameter but fails to consistently handle all cases as indicated by the GitHub issue.
4. The `key_type` inference is not correctly identifying the type in some cases, leading to improper indexing behavior.
5. The inconsistency in handling different indexer types causes errors when trying to access elements that do not exist in the Series index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, especially lists, arrays, and Index objects. This inconsistency leads to incorrect interpretations of the indexers and causes unexpected behavior when accessing elements not present in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently to avoid misinterpretations and errors. Correctly infer the type of indexers to determine the appropriate indexing method and prevent unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)  # Convert to list if necessary

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
1. Ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers ('list', 'np.ndarray', 'ExtensionArray', etc.).
2. Convert key to a list if it falls under these types to maintain uniformity in handling.
3. Properly infer the key_type to determine whether to use 'loc' or 'iloc' for indexing.
4. By making these changes, the function should align with the expectations highlighted in the GitHub issue and behave consistently across different indexer types.
