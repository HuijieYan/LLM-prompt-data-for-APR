### Issue Analysis
The bug occurs when indexing a Series with a list key that doesn't match any index values. The bug results in the unexpected behavior of throwing an error instead of returning NaN values like other types of keys.

### Potential Error Location
The issue might be in the part of the function that handles list-like keys that don't match any values in the index.

### Cause of the Bug
- In all cases, the key_type is inferred as `'string'`, which seems incorrect as it is expected to be `'integer'` for positional indexing.
- The key `'C'` doesn't exist in the index, which results in an error during the indexing operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Correctly infer the key_type based on the input key instead of always inferring it as `'string'`.
- Handle the case where a list key doesn't match any values in the index to return NaN values instead of raising an error.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and all(k in self.index for k in key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should handle the cases where a list key doesn't match any values in the index by returning NaN values, aligning with the expected behavior. Additionally, this function will correctly handle the type inference for the key to ensure the appropriate indexing method is used.
