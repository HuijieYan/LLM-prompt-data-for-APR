### Analysis
The `buggy function` `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs to retrieve values from a `Series` object. The bug seems to lie in the handling of list indexers. The `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'integer'` or `'boolean'` when it should be handled as a list-like key. This leads to incorrect behavior in the function.

### Error Location
The primary error likely occurs in the conditional block where it checks for list-like keys. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the key is a list-like object.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to the misclassification of list-like keys, leading to incorrect inference of key type. This causes the function to take the wrong path in processing the key, resulting in inaccurate outputs.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly identified and processed as such. This involves updating the conditional logic for handling list-like keys and avoiding misclassification of key types.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle list-like keys correctly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Avoid mixed handling of cases
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the misclassification of list-like keys and ensures that they are processed correctly within the function.
