### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the function `_get_with` in the handling of different types of key inputs. Specifically, the issue arises when `key` is a list but is attempted to be converted to an Index type improperly. This results in incorrect behavior when attempting to index a Series using a list key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we need to address the conversion of `key` to the correct type before indexing the Series. We should handle the case where `key` is a list appropriately to prevent the error highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles the case when `key` is a list or numpy array differently by directly indexing the Series without converting `key` unnecessarily to the Index type, which was leading to the bug.
