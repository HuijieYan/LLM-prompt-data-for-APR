### Bugs Identified:
1. The function is not handling the case where the `key` is a list correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially raising errors.
2. The function is not differentiating between different types of input `key` correctly, causing incorrect identification of key types.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes an issue when the `key` is a list. The function is not properly handling lists as key inputs, leading to wrong key identification. This discrepancy causes the function to return incorrect `key_type` values, ultimately resulting in unexpected behavior and potential errors.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate between list-like input `key` values and other types correctly. This requires updating the logic parsing different `key` types within the function to ensure proper identification of key types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the handling of list-like keys and differentiating between key types accurately, the function will now behave as expected and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
