The buggy function `_get_with` is failing because it doesn't handle the case where the key is an iterable like a list or ndarray correctly. When passed a list, the function tries to determine the `key_type` based on the elements in the list, but it incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior and raises a `KeyError` in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case when `key` is an iterable like a list. We should check if the key is iterable and then handle it accordingly, ensuring that the `key_type` is determined correctly so that indexing works as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the `key` is iterable and converts it to an `Index` object when needed. It also ensures that the `key_type` is determined accurately based on the elements in the `key`, allowing for correct indexing behavior.

By making these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to inconsistent behavior when indexing with arrays, lists, or other index-like objects.
