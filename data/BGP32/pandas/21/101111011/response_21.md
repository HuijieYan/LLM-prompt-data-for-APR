## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of pandas is not handling the case where the key is a `List`-like object correctly. Specifically, the function does not properly handle the situation where the key is a list of values that are not found in the index of the series. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised incorrectly.

In the failing test case, the key is being converted to a different type (`Box`) using `box(key)`, and then passed to the `ser[key]` operation. The `_get_with` function does not handle the `Box` type correctly, leading to the `KeyError` being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case where the key is a list-like object that may contain values not present in the index of the series. We should ensure that the function behaves consistently across different types of indexers, including lists, arrays, and indexes.

## The corrected version of the `_get_with` function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case for key not found in index
    missing_keys = set(key) - set(self.index)
    if missing_keys:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {Index(list(missing_keys), dtype='object')} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where the key contains values that are not found in the index of the series, and will raise a `KeyError` for those missing keys.
