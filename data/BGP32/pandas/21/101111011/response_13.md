## Fixing the Bug

### The Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is called with an input key that is a list or ndarray. The function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError`. This inconsistency is highlighted by the failing test cases provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles list-like indexers such as lists, ndarrays, and Index objects. We can modify the logic in the function to handle these cases correctly and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of the Fix
In the corrected version of the function:
- We ensure that the input key is converted to an Index object using `ensure_index(key)`.
- This conversion ensures that the key is consistently treated as an Index object, preventing the `KeyError` that occurred due to inconsistent handling of list-like indexers.
- By handling all list-like indexers as Index objects, the function now correctly processes different types of indexers, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.

By implementing these changes, the `_get_with` function will now handle list-like indexers consistently and avoid the `KeyError` reported in the failing tests.
