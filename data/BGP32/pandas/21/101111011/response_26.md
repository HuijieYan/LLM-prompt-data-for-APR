### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling different types of input keys. Specifically, when the input key is a list-like object, the function fails to correctly handle it, leading to a `KeyError`. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers causes the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle list-like input keys correctly and consistently with other types of indexers. We should modify the logic in the function to handle list-like keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        raise KeyError("Key type not supported")
```

### Explanation of Correction
In the corrected version of the function:
1. We handle list-like keys first by checking `is_list_like(key)`. If the key is list-like, we directly use `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values.
2. We then check for other types of indexers like NumPy arrays, Series, and Index objects to handle them accordingly.
3. For cases where the key type is not supported, we raise a `KeyError` to indicate the issue.

By making these adjustments, the function should now be able to handle list-like keys correctly and consistently, resolving the failing test cases related to different types of indexers.
