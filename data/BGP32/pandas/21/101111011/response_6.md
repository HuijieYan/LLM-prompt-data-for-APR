## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers and perform the corresponding operations based on the type of the `key` parameter. However, the function encounters an issue when the `key` is of type `list`. In this situation, the function incorrectly attempts to access the `key_type`, which results in the function returning `self.loc[key]` unexpectedly.

The failing test cases all involve passing a list-like object `key` to the `ser[key]` operation. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access elements not present in the Series, but the buggy behavior causes the function to return NaN instead.

## Identifying potential error locations

The problematic area in the `_get_with` function is when handling the `key` that is not recognized as an array-like object but is a list-like object. In this case, the function misinterprets the type of the `key` leading to incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the bug

1. When `key` is of type list, the function incorrectly identifies it as not list-like, leading to the key being processed as a scalar.
2. This misclassification causes the function to improperly return `self.loc[key]`, resulting in unexpected results.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To resolve the bug:
- Adjust the logic for determining if the `key` is list-like to correctly identify list-like objects.
- Update the corresponding return operation for list-like objects to handle the case appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]  # Return the incorrect location value
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version above, the fix includes updating the condition for identifying list-like objects and ensuring that the correct response is returned for list-like keys, resolving the unexpected behavior identified in the failing tests.
