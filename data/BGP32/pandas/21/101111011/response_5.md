## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects.
2. The failing test is expecting that using a list-like object as an indexer should raise a `KeyError` if the value is not found in the index.
3. The bug seems to be in the handling of list-like indexers, where the behavior differs based on the input type.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like object is passed as the key, the function does not properly handle the case where the value is not found in the index, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that list-like indexers are treated consistently, similar to how other indexers are handled.
2. Specifically, when a list-like object is passed as the key and the value is not found in the index, a `KeyError` should be raised to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        try:
            # Attempt to access using the list-like key
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this corrected version, the function will now properly handle list-like objects as indexers and raise a `KeyError` when the value is not found in the index, aligning with the expected behavior in the failing test cases.
