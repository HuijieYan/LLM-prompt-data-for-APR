### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The issue arises when the input parameter `key` is a list or an array. The function incorrectly handles these cases, leading to a `KeyError` because it fails to find the elements in the index.

In the failing test, the key is converted to a different type (list, numpy array, Index, or Series) before being used as an indexer for the `ser`, which is a `Series` instance. The bug manifests when the key is a list, leading to the incorrect handling and subsequent `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly handle cases where the key is either a list or an array. We need to ensure that the key is converted to a format compatible with indexing the `Series` object.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_object_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_scalar(key):
        result = self.loc[key]
        if result.shape != ():
            return result

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `if` condition to check for object data type and not a scalar key, we ensure correct handling of list-like or array indexing, resolving the `KeyError` issue.

This correction accounts for the bug by considering list-like or non-scalar keys appropriately when indexing the `Series` object.
