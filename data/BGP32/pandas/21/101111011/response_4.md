## Fixing the Bug

Based on the analysis of the failing test and the runtime values of variables, it seems that the issue lies in how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically failing for the list type and raising a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. In this case, we need to modify the function to handle the list type of indexers correctly to avoid the `KeyError` exception.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the case where the key is a list by converting it into an Index using the `ensure_index` function. This change will prevent the `KeyError` exception and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
