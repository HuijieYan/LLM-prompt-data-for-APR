## Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `_get_with()` function arises from how different types of key input are handled inconsistently, leading to an incorrect behavior when dealing with a list-like key. The function incorrectly tries to handle different types of keys without considering the specific case of a list key, which causes the KeyError when trying to access the series with a list key.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list keys are handled appropriately in `_get_with()` function. We should specifically handle list-like keys separately to avoid the KeyError issue encountered in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, we explicitly handle list-like keys and ensure that they are processed correctly without causing a KeyError. This fix addresses the inconsistency in handling different key types and aligns the behavior when accessing the series with various types of keys.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue raised in the GitHub report regarding the inconsistency in handling different indexer types.
