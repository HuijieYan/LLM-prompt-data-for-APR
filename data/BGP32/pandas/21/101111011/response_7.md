## Analyzing the buggy function and failing tests

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is designed to handle various types of indexing key inputs and return the corresponding values from the `Series`. However, there is a specific issue when dealing with a list-like key input, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised incorrectly.

### Potential Error Location
- The bug specifically impacts the section of code where a check for a non-list-like key is performed, and if it is not recognized as a list-like object, the function attempts to extract values using `self.loc[key]`. This part is where the issue arises, as the non-list-like key is being incorrectly identified.

### Cause of the Bug
- The bug occurs because the condition for identifying a non-list-like key is flawed. In the failing tests, different types of key inputs are passed (e.g., list, ndarray, Index, Series), but the function does not correctly handle all these cases. This leads to an incorrect identification of the key type, resulting in the wrong branch of code being executed, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- To fix the bug, it is crucial to properly identify the type of the key input and handle it correctly based on its characteristics. By updating the type check logic and branching conditions, the function can accurately determine the key type and choose the appropriate method for extracting values from the `Series`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if not self.index.is_unique:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self._index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the type checks and branching logic in the function, it should now correctly handle different types of key inputs and extract values without raising a `KeyError`. This corrected version ensures that the function can distinguish between list-like and scalar keys, addressing the root cause of the bug.
