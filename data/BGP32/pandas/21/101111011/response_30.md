## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when accessing the Series with a list-like key. The issue arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, causing the failing tests to raise errors.

### Bug Summary
The bug occurs when the `_get_with` function encounters a list-like key. It fails to properly handle the list-like key, resulting in a `KeyError` during indexing.

### Runtime Values Analysis
- In Case 1, the input key is a list, and the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`.
- In Case 2, the input key is an ndarray, and again the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`.
- In Case 3, the input key is an Index, and the `key_type` is inferred correctly as `'string'`.
- In Case 4, the input key is a Series, and the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`.

The incorrect inference of the key type as `'string'` seems to be a common issue in all cases and might be leading to the incorrect behavior for list-like keys.

### GitHub Issue Relevance
The GitHub issue highlighted the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other indexers, leading to unexpected behavior in certain scenarios. This aligns with the problem observed in the failing tests and the `_get_with` function.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly handles list-like keys similar to other indexers. We should update the logic to handle list-like keys properly to avoid the `KeyError` and achieve consistency in behavior across different indexer types.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like keys properly
    if is_list_like(key):
        if is_extension_array_dtype(key):
            key = key.tolist()
        elif not is_object_dtype(key):
            key = np.asarray(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the proper handling of list-like keys, ensuring uniform behavior across different indexer types.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
