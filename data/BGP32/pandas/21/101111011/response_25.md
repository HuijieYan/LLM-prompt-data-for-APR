## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class arises from the handling of different types of indexers. In the failing test cases, when using a list indexer, the function fails to properly handle it and raises a `KeyError`. This inconsistency in behavior is noticed when comparing how array-like indexers are handled differently from list indexers.

The key issue here is that the function treats list indexers differently than array-like indexers, leading to undesirable behavior and inconsistency in error handling. The failing test cases clearly demonstrate this mismatch in behavior for different types of indexers, causing unexpected errors.

## Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. We should eliminate the behavior discrepancy between list indexers and array-like indexers to provide uniform error handling and behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers appropriately and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers, resolving the inconsistencies observed in the failing test cases.
