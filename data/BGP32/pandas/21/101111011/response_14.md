## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of keys (like slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc.) for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches()` expects the same behavior when using different indexers like list, ndarray, Index, or Series. It creates a Series object and tries to access a key that does not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The failing test indicates inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers, with the list indexer behaving differently from other types like ndarray, Index, and Series.
4. The runtime values and types of variables in the buggy function show that the `key_type` is incorrectly determined as `'string'`, which might lead to incorrect indexing behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with(key)` function. When a list indexer is used, it raises a `KeyError` instead of falling back to `self.loc[key]`, which is the expected behavior according to the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and align the behavior of list indexers with other indexer types, we need to modify the condition where a list key is encountered. It should also fall back to `self.loc[key]` to match the behavior of other types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with(key)` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated condition for list-like key
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition for list-like keys to fall back to `self.loc[key]`, we ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers when indexing a Series object. This correction aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the failing test.
