## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class does not handle list-like indexers correctly.
2. When a list-like indexer is passed to the function, it wrongly checks if the key is an instance of `Index` and infers the key type as `'integer'`.
3. This incorrect type inference leads to inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
4. The failing test case demonstrates the issue by raising a `KeyError` when trying to index the series with a list.
5. The bug is related to the differences in handling list-like indexers compared to other types like ndarray or Index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different indexer types.
2. Make sure that when a list-like key is provided, the function correctly identifies it as such and does not infer the type as `'integer'`.
3. Update the logic to handle list-like indexers in a way that aligns with other types of indexers like Index, ndarray, or Series.
4. The goal is to fix the bug so that the failing tests pass and the behavior is consistent across different indexer types.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug related to inconsistent behavior when using list-like indexers in a Pandas `Series` should be resolved. The corrected function handles list indexers correctly and aligns the behavior with other types of indexers, ensuring a consistent approach to indexing operations.
