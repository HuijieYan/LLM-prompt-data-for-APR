### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. The failing test is related to the behavior of passing a list-like indexer to the Series object.
2. The bug occurs when processing a list-like key within the function, leading to a KeyError in the failing test.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly handles list-like key indexers, leading to an error when trying to access elements that are not present in the index of the Series.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like key indexers are properly handled to prevent KeyError and align with the expected behavior when accessing non-existent keys within the index.

### Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and all(elem in self.index for elem in key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)

```

By modifying the handling of list-like key indexers and adding a check to ensure that all elements in the key are present in the Series index, the corrected version of the function addresses the issue raised in the failing test.
