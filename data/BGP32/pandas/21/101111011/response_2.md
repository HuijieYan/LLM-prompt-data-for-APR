## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of input keys to retrieve values from a Series object.
2. The failing test is designed to test the behavior when indexing with a list-like key that has no matches in the Series index.
3. The error occurs when trying to index with a list-like key that does not match any index values.
4. The buggy function reaches a point where it incorrectly determines the key_type as `'integer'` when it should consider the key as a list-like object for which no matches are found.
5. This incorrect determination leads the function to try and reconcile the key as an integer indexer, which causes the KeyError to be raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of list-like keys without matches in the Series index. When no matches are found, the function should raise a KeyError similar to indexing with other array-like data types.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string"]:
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By correcting the handling of list-like keys without matches in the Series index and raising a KeyError in such cases, the corrected version of the function should be able to pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
