## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to index a Series causing inconsistent behavior.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of certain index types leading to KeyError in some cases, specifically when a `list` is used as a key.
4. The runtime values and types show that the key type is inferred as a string while it should be an object.

## Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not appropriately handle indexing when a `list` key is provided. It mistakenly infers the key type as a string, leading to unexpected behavior and a KeyError when trying to index with a list.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred, and the indexing logic is consistent across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Correct the type inference for the key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for string types
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:  # Default case for other types
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these corrections, the fixed function should now handle indexing with different types of keys consistently and avoid the KeyError issue experienced in the failing tests.
