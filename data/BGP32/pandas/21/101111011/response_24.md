## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with different indexers like lists, NumPy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. The bug causes a `KeyError` when indexing with a list indexer, unlike when using other indexer types like NumPy arrays or Index objects.
4. The buggy function wrongly categorizes the list indexer case, leading to the incorrect behavior that results in a `KeyError`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers, advocating for a unified behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers to avoid the `KeyError`. By ensuring consistent treatment of list indexers, the function can align with the expected behavior and resolve the failing test cases.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in {"string", "integer"}:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above to treat list indexers similar to other array-like indexers, the issue causing the `KeyError` in the failing tests will be resolved. This modification aligns with the proposed fix strategy and addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
