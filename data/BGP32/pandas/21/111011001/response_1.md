### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a `Series`. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that a `KeyError` is not raised when indexing with a key that is not present in the Series index.

The buggy function contains multiple conditional blocks to handle different key types, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and other non-list-like types. However, the bug seems to occur when dealing with list-like keys.

From the provided runtime values and types, we can see that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in multiple cases. This incorrect identification of the key type leads to the wrong execution path in the function, causing the `KeyError` not to be raised when expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect identification of the key type, leading to the wrong behavior when handling list-like keys. The function fails to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the Series index due to this misidentification.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect identification of the key type. We should ensure that the key type is correctly determined and that the function handles list-like keys appropriately by raising a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not any(is_integer(i) for i in key):
        # Raise KeyError if key is a list-like object and no integer values found
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
    else:
        # Handle other types of keys
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the key is list-like and contains non-integer values. If it does, we verify if any of the values exist in the Series index. If not, we raise a `KeyError` with the relevant message. This ensures that the function correctly handles list-like keys that are not present in the index.
