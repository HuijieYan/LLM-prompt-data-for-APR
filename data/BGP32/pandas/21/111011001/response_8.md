### Analysis
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` is not handling all possible types of keys properly. In particular, when the key is a list-like object, the function tries to access the key directly without considering that it may not exist in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function `_get_with` not handling list-like keys correctly. When a key is not found in the index, the function attempts to access it directly, assuming it exists in the index.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the function when dealing with list-like keys that may not exist in the index. Instead of directly trying to access the key, we should first check if all elements of the key are present in the index before proceeding. If any element is not found, we should raise a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function `_get_with` checks if all elements of a list-like key exist in the index before accessing them. If any element is not found, a `KeyError` is raised with a relevant error message, avoiding the previous issue where a KeyError was not being handled correctly.
