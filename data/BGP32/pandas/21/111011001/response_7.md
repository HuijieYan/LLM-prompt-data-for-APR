### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is throwing a `KeyError` when indexing with a key that is not found in the Series index. The bug seems to stem from how the function handles non-list-like keys when determining the key type. In the provided cases, the key is not recognized as a list-like object, leading to the incorrect key type being inferred as `'string'`. This incorrect key type then causes the function to take the wrong branch when deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of non-list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that keys of type `Index`, `Series`, and array-like objects are correctly identified as list-like to prevent the incorrect key type inference. Additionally, we should handle non-list-like keys properly to avoid the `KeyError` when trying to index with them.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series) or is_array_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By explicitly checking if the key should be treated as a list when not recognized as list-like, we ensure correct key type inference and appropriate handling of various key types, avoiding the `KeyError` issue.
