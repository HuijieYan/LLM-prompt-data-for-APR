### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is supposed to handle different types of input `key` and return the corresponding values from the Series either by slicing, getting a tuple of values, using `loc`, or reindexing. The bug seems to occur when the input `key` is of type `Index`, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing tests.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function incorrectly handles the case when `key` is of type `Index`. It tries to determine the `key_type` using the `infer_dtype` function and then decides whether to treat the `key` as a positional indexer or label-based indexer. However, this logic is flawed, leading to incorrect handling of `key` when it is of type `Index`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should remove the logic that determines `key_type` and instead handle the case when `key` is of type `Index` directly. Since `key` is already an `Index` object, we can return the result of `self.loc[key]` directly for this case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By directly returning `self.loc[key]` when `key` is of type `Index`, we address the bug and ensure correct behavior, resolving the failing test cases.
