### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, determining the type of key and then appropriately selecting either `loc` or `iloc` to access the data. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect inference of the key type, leading to the use of an incorrect method for indexing.

1. The function incorrectly infers the key type to be `'string'` in all cases observed, while it should be identifying the key type correctly based on the input data.
2. The code then proceeds to incorrectly choose between `loc` and `iloc` based on this incorrectly inferred key type, leading to a KeyError when trying to index data that is not present in the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is accurately inferred from the input key data. Based on the provided cases, it seems that the correct key type should be `'object'` since the keys are strings.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Infer the key type accurately
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the key type is inferred properly before selecting the appropriate indexing method, fixing the bug that caused the KeyError.
