### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is a bug when the key is provided as a list of values, the function incorrectly determines the `key_type` as `'string'`. This incorrect determination of the `key_type` leads to the wrong path being taken in the function, resulting in an error being raised when trying to index the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to correctly identify the type of the key provided. In the cases where a list-like key is passed, the `key_type` should be correctly identified as `'list'` or similar, instead of `'string'`. This identification will ensure that the correct indexing path is taken based on the type of the key.

### Corrected Version

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key_type = "list"  # Identify key as a list
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making this change to correctly determine the `key_type` based on whether the `key` is list-like, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should avoid the bug and pass the failing tests.
