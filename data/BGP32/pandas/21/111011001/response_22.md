### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, it contains a bug that leads to the KeyError when trying to access non-existent keys. 

The bug originates from the incorrect handling of keys that are not recognized as lists, arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, or Index objects. When the key is scalar, the function tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`. If `key` is not found in the index, this results in a KeyError as observed in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of scalar keys that are not found in the index differently. Instead of directly accessing the key using `self.loc[key]`, we will check if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it. If the key exists, we return the corresponding value; otherwise, we raise a `KeyError` to replicate the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalar keys
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{repr(key)} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the conditional check for scalar keys and raising a KeyError if the key is not found in the index, we ensure that the function handles such cases gracefully without causing unexpected exceptions.
