### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input `key`. However, the bug seems to arise from the incorrect handling of the key type when it is a list-like object.

From the provided error messages and runtime input/output values:
- The problem occurs when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
- The error message suggests that the key `'C'` is not found in the index of the Series, resulting in a `KeyError`.
- The `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which indicates that the logic for determining the key type is not working as intended, leading to incorrect indexing operations.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect key type inference, leading to improper indexing operations when `key` is a list-like object. Since the key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, the function does not handle list-like keys appropriately, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the key type inference logic to correctly identify list-like keys. This involves ensuring that list-like keys are recognized and handled appropriately in the function to avoid the `KeyError` when indexing the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes a check for list-like keys and ensures that they are properly handled by converting them to a list before further processing. This change should address the issue with key type inference and prevent the `KeyError` when indexing the Series.
