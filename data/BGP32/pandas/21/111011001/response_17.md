### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to occur when the key is a string-like object but is not recognized correctly. The key_type is inferred as `'string'` in all cases where it should be `'object'`. This incorrect inference leads to faulty indexing behavior and, ultimately, the KeyError in the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect inference of the key_type when handling string-like objects. This leads to the wrong choice of indexing method (`self.loc[key]` instead of `self.reindex(key)`) and consequently the KeyError in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred as `'object'` when the key is a string-like object so that the correct indexing method (`self.reindex`) is used in those cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Correct key_type inference for string-like objects
    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):  # Corrected condition
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to correctly handle string-like objects as scalars so that they are categorized as `'object'` types, leading to the usage of the appropriate indexing method for these cases. This change should fix the bug and make the function behave correctly as expected.
