### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to occur when the key is a list, array, Index, or Series, resulting in a KeyError during indexing.

Looking at the buggy function, the issue arises when the key_type is inferred as "string" instead of "integer". This leads to wrong path selection based on the key_type condition. Consequently, the function tries to index the Series with a string key that does not exist in the index, leading to a KeyError in the failing tests.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly inferring the key_type as "string" when it should have been "integer". This leads to wrong indexing paths being taken in the function, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access non-existent string keys.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly infer the key_type and ensure that the correct indexing path is chosen based on the type of key provided. We should prioritize the "integer" path for list, array, Index, and Series keys to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes highlighted in the code above, we ensure that the correct indexing path is followed based on the type of key provided, which should prevent the KeyError from occurring in the failing tests.
