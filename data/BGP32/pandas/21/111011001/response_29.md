The issue in the buggy function `_get_with` is related to the handling of the key parameter. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, leading to errors when trying to access elements based on the key type. The bug occurs when the key type is inferred as 'string' but should be determined differently based on the input.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled in each case. We can modify the function to handle different key types appropriately and avoid the KeyError that is currently being raised in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the key type identification and handle the different scenarios according to the key type. By properly determining the key type and handling it accordingly, the function should now pass the failing test cases without raising a KeyError.
