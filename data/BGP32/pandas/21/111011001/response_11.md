## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, data frames, tuples, and non-list-like elements. The bug seems to occur when the input key is a list, causing an error that is not properly handled.

## Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_get_with`, there is a conditional block that checks if the type of the input key is not list-like and then proceeds to use the `loc` attribute to retrieve data. However, when the input key is a list, this block is bypassed, and the code tries to handle the key in a way that leads to a `KeyError`. This behavior is evident from the failing test cases where inputs that are list-like cause the function to raise a `KeyError` instead of being properly handled.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that lists are properly handled by the function. One way to address this issue is to explicitly handle the case where the key is a list before the conditional block that checks for list-like elements. By adding a specific check for lists and handling them appropriately, the function can avoid raising a `KeyError` when a list key is provided.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # Explicitly handle the case when key is a list
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now explicitly handles the case where the key is a list before proceeding with the other checks. This fix should prevent the function from raising a `KeyError` when a list key is provided as input.
