### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key to be used for indexing is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. Instead of correctly indexing the Series with these types of keys, it ends up with an incorrect `key_type`, leading to errors like `KeyError` during indexing.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring because the variable `key` is not being correctly handled when it is a list, numpy array, pandas Index or pandas Series. The function wrongly infers the data type of `key` as `'string'` when it should be indexing based on the list/array values. This incorrect inference leads to a mismatch between the key type and the data in the Series, causing errors during indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, the function indexes correctly based on the values within the key rather than treating them as strings. We should also handle the case when `key` is a generic iterable to avoid any potential errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Ensure key is a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that when `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, the function correctly indexes based on the values in the key. This should resolve the `KeyError` issues observed during testing.
