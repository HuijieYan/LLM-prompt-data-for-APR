### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect handling of different types of key inputs. The function is unable to correctly handle a case where the key is provided as a list-like object (such as a list, numpy array, pandas index, or pandas series). This leads to a KeyError when the `ser[key]` operation is performed in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle list-like objects as keys appropriately. We should convert the key to a list if it is not already in list format before processing. This will ensure uniform handling of different input types when extracting values from the series. 

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly converting the key to a list if it's not list-like before processing, we ensure that the function can handle different types of keys correctly. This should resolve the KeyError issues in the failing test cases.
