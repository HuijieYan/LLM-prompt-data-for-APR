### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when trying to handle different types of keys. The bug is related to determining the type of the key and then deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing. The bug arises due to the incorrect identification of the key type, resulting in the wrong indexing method being selected.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function first checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple. If it's none of these, it proceeds to determine the type of the key.
2. If the key is not a list-like object, it tries to access the `self.loc[key]`. This causes the bug when the key should have been treated as a scalar but is not recognized.
3. The key is then converted to a list, assuming it's some iterable object. This addresses the issue of unrecognized scalars but leads to incorrect indexing in some cases.
4. Depending on the inferred type of the key, it chooses between label-based (`self.loc`) or positional (`self.iloc`) indexing.
5. Due to the incorrect inference of key type, the wrong indexing method is selected, leading to the KeyError in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
- Improve the key type inference process to correctly identify the type of key being passed.
- Handle scalar keys properly without converting them to lists.
- Ensure that the correct indexing method (`self.loc` or `self.iloc`) is selected based on the key type.
- Handle the scenario where the key should be treated as a label-based indexer or a positional indexer.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles scalar keys properly, identifies the key type accurately, and selects the correct indexing method based on the key type.
