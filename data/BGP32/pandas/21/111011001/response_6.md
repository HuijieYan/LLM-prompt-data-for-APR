### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key is a list-like object containing a single element. In this scenario, the key is not recognized as a list or numpy array which results in incorrect handling by the function. The bug is triggered when trying to access a single element that is not present in the Series index.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the logic that checks for list-like objects. When the key is a list-like object containing a single element, it fails to properly recognize it as a list or numpy array, leading to an incorrect path in the function execution. This causes the function to attempt to locate the key using `self.loc[key]`, resulting in the KeyError.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that single-element list-like keys are properly recognized and handled. By modifying the condition for checking list-like objects, we can address the issue and allow the function to correctly locate the key in such scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix ensures that single-element list-like keys are treated as lists, allowing the function to locate the key correctly.
