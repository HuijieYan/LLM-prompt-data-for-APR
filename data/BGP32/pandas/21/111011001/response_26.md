### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to how the function deals with the key when it is a list or numpy array. The key is being incorrectly classified as a string (`key_type = 'string'`) when it should be recognizing it as a list-like or an Index type.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function misclassifies the key type as a string in cases where the key is a list or a numpy array. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior and eventually raises a `KeyError` as the key is not properly recognized to match any indexes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies list-like keys and numpy array keys. We should properly identify these keys as list, numpy array, or Index types, enabling the correct indexing operation. 

### Corrected Code

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code snippet includes the modification in the key type handling for list-like keys and numpy array keys to ensure proper indexing operations and avoid the `KeyError`.
