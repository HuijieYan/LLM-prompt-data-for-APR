### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys to retrieve values from a Series. However, the bug seems to be in the comparison of `key_type` with `'integer'` which is an uncommon check for keys. The error occurs when the key type is identified as `'string'` and the code fails to properly handle this case. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that is not present in the Series.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of keys in the `_get_with` function. When the key is identified as `'string'`, the code does not properly locate the key in the Series, leading to the `KeyError` during the test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the code handles keys of type `'string'` properly, and does not lead to a `KeyError`. We need to modify the conditional blocks related to key types to handle the situation when the key is a string.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adapting the checks for key types in the corrected version, we ensure that keys of type `'string'` are handled correctly, preventing the `KeyError` from occurring during the test.
