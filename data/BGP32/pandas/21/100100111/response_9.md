### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates the issue with the inconsistency of behavior when using a `list` key for indexing.
3. The expected behavior for indexing with list, ndarray, Index, or Series keys should be consistent, as pointed out in the GitHub issue.
4. The bug seems to lie in the handling of a `list` key input, causing a KeyError when indexing.
   
### Issue Cause:
- The bug is mainly due to inconsistent behavior when indexing with a `list` key compared to other key types like ndarray or Index.
- The function tries to convert the input key into different types, leading to unexpected behavior during indexing with a `list` key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the code to handle list-like keys consistently across all types to resolve the issue.
- Implement a more stable logic for indexing operations with different key types.
- Ensure that the function correctly interprets the type of key input and handles it appropriately to avoid errors.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_object_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_scalar(key):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if all(is_scalar(k) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise TypeError("Invalid key type for indexing a Series.")
```

This corrected function provides consistent behavior for indexing with list, ndarray, Index, or Series keys, as expected. It addresses the issues related to key conversion and ensures proper indexing operations without causing errors.
