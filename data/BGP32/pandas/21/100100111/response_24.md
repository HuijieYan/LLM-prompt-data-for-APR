## Analysis
1. The `key` parameter in the buggy function is processed differently based on its type, leading to inconsistent behavior.
2. The issue described on GitHub highlights the discrepancy between how different types of indexers are treated, especially the inconsistency with list indexers.
3. The failing test case expects an error message due to the inconsistency in handling list indexers.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to different treatments of `key` based on its type. The conditional checks lead to varying outcomes based on whether `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test case, which expects an error message for a specific case that is not handled properly in the current implementation.

## Solution Strategy
To fix the bug and align the behavior with the expectations outlined in the failing test, we should ensure consistent handling of different types of `key` parameters. By treating list indexers similar to other indexers, we can provide a unified approach and address the inconsistency identified in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)
        
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic in the function to treat all different types of `key` in a consistent manner before determining the `key_type`, we can ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectations outlined in the failing test case and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
