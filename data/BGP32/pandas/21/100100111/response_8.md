### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a Series when using list indexers compared to other indexers like arrays or Index objects.
- The failing test case aims to show that the behavior of indexing with different types of objects (list, ndarray, Index, Series) should be consistent and raise the same KeyError if the value is not found in the index.

### Potential Errors:
- The buggy function may not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError if the value is not found.
- The function distinguishes different types of indexers but does not provide consistent behavior across all types.

### Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function `_get_with` encounters an issue when handling list-like key objects for indexing a Series.
- In the failing test case, the key object is expected to raise a KeyError when the value is not found in the index, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly for list indexers.
- The function should ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, especially when dealing with list-like objects.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the issue and fix the bug:
- Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other indexers by checking for the presence of the key in the index.
- Ensure that the function raises a KeyError when the key is not found in the index, maintaining consistency across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle list-like indexers correctly and raise a KeyError if the value is not present in the index, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
