The issue described on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers in the Series class. Specifically, when trying to access elements not in the index using different types of indexers, the behavior varies, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions. The failing test provided demonstrates this inconsistency for different types of indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the section handling non-list-like keys, there might be a case where a KeyError is raised that should not be raised for certain types of indexers.
2. The logic for handling different types of key inputs might not be correctly identifying the type of indexer in certain cases.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when using a list indexer to access elements not present in the Series index. This leads to a KeyError due to inconsistent handling of different indexer types within the `_get_with` function. The key issue arises from the specific check for list-like keys, leading to incorrect error handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other indexer types in the `_get_with` function. This involves identifying the correct type of key input and handling it appropriately to prevent the KeyError exception when accessing elements not in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue identified in the failing test by handling list indexers consistently with other indexer types.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the corrected version of the function, the inconsistent handling of list indexers causing KeyError exceptions is resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test case with correct error handling for all types of indexers.
