## Analysis
1. The `key` parameter in the failing test is passed as an ndarray, Index, or Series type to the `_get_with` function.
2. The key type is inferred to be a string for the failing test cases.
3. The bug causes an inconsistency in how different types of keys are handled, leading to a KeyError in specific cases.
4. The bug relates to the treatment of list-like key types compared to other key types in the `_get_with` function. The bug results in incorrect handling of keys provided as lists.
5. The bug directly relates to the GitHub issue raised, where the behavior for different key types is inconsistent.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list-like keys with other key types. Specifically, we should handle list-like keys properly to avoid the KeyError that is currently being raised. By ensuring that list-like keys are treated in a similar manner to other key types, we can resolve the inconsistency and address the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Index is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame/Index column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or is_iterator(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition for list-like keys and handling them similarly to other key types, the inconsistency in handling different keys is resolved. This fix should address the failing test cases and align the behavior of the function with the expected input/output values.
