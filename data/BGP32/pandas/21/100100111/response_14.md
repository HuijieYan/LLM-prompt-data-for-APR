### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys and return the appropriate value based on the type of input.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a Key Error when trying to access an index that does not exist in the Series.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key input, causing it to raise a KeyError incorrectly.
4. The bug is related to how the function handles list-like keys compared to other key types, as discussed in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Description:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent handling of list-like keys. When the function encounters a list-like key, it incorrectly tries to `reindex` the key, resulting in a KeyError due to the mismatch with the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle list-like keys in a similar manner to other key types to maintain consistency. We should avoid calling `reindex` on list-like keys and handle them appropriately for Series indexing. 

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys appropriately for Series indexing
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # No need to call reindex for list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other key types accordingly
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the bug related to handling list-like keys has been addressed by avoiding unnecessary `reindex` calls and ensuring consistent behavior across different key types.
