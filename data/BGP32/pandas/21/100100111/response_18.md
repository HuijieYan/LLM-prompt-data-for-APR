### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys passed for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to occur when a list-like key is passed as an input.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior when a key that is not present in the index is used for indexing.
4. The bug is causing an inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different types of keys such as lists, arrays, indexes, or series.
5. The provided test cases illustrate the expected values and types of input parameters and intermediate variables during the failing test execution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed. The function incorrectly handles list key types and throws a `KeyError`, which is not consistent with the behavior for other key types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys correctly and consistently with other key types. The function should not raise a `KeyError` when indexing with a list. Instead, it should handle list keys appropriately to maintain consistent behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should now handle list-like keys correctly and maintain the expected behavior across different key types.
