### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` handles different types of `key` inputs such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and list-like inputs.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` passes in different types of `key` inputs to a `Series` object and expects a KeyError with a specific message if the key does not match any value in the index.
3. The bug causes an inconsistency in how different types of `key` inputs are handled by raising a KeyError with different messages, mainly affecting list-like inputs.

### Bug:
The bug is in the handling of list-like `key` inputs where the function expects it to be an Index object, leading to the KeyError with an incorrect message.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for handling list-like keys so that it works consistently with other key types. We need to ensure that the correct indexer is used regardless of the type of the key.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version updates the handling of list-like keys by converting them to an Index object before inferring the key type and continuing with the same logic for determining the indexer based on the key type.

With this correction, the function should handle list-like keys consistently with other key types and pass the failing test scenario provided.
