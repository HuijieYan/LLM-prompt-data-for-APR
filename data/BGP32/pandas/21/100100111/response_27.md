### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue with how it handles different types of indexers, specifically when the key is a list. The function tries to handle list-like keys in multiple conditional branches, leading to ambiguity and inconsistency in handling the indexers. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` highlights the inconsistency in how the function handles list indexers compared to other types of indexers like numpy arrays or Series.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The conditional branches for handling different types of indexers are not well-defined and lead to ambiguity.
2. The handling of list-like keys is inconsistent compared to other types of indexers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from a lack of consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When encountering a list-like key, the function tries to handle it in multiple conditional branches, leading to confusion and ultimately raising a `KeyError` in certain cases where it should not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure a consistent approach to handle different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should align the handling of list-like keys with how other types of indexers are treated to avoid inconsistencies and errors.

### Bug-Fixed Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By revising the code to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, we can fix the bug and ensure the function behaves correctly across all indexer types.
