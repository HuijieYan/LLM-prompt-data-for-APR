### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs to retrieve values from a Series object.
2. The failing test scenario creates a Series object `ser` with values "A" and "B", then tries to access a non-existent key value "C" using different types of key containers.
3. The bug is likely occurring when the key type is a list of values, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the non-existent key value.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is used, it leads to a KeyError if the key is not present in the index, unlike other indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers, similar to other array-like indexers. This may involve adjusting the logic for list-like keys to prevent KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, we can address the KeyError issue and ensure the function passes the failing test case.
