To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. The issue arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. The modification should address this inconsistency and ensure that behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars or non-recognized values
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    key = list(key)  # Ensure key is a list
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer (iloc) or label-based (loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is a list
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that when the key is a list-like object, it will be handled consistently regardless of its type. The modification addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and should pass the failing test provided in the question.

Please consider incorporating this fix into the `pandas` source code to resolve the reported issue.
