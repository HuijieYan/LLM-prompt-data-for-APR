## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys and perform operations accordingly.
2. The bug seems to occur when the key is a list, and the function is trying to handle this case differently compared to other indexers.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior when indexing with a key that does not match any values in the series' index. The expected behavior is consistent across different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series), but the actual behavior is inconsistent.
4. The bug causes an inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of key indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the handling of list indexers to match the behavior of other array-like indexers.
2. Update the `_get_with` function to check for list-like keys and handle them consistently with other array-like keys.
3. Ensure that the bug fix aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Infer dtype for list indexer
        if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:  # Consistent handling for list-like keys
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)  # Handle other types of list indexers

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these modifications, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected behavior documented in the GitHub issue.
