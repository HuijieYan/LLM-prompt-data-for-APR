## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs and return the corresponding values in a Series object. However, the bug is related to how the function handles a key that is of type list. In the failing test case, the key is a list that does not match any values in the Series index, leading to a KeyError.

## Potential Error Locations
- The handling of key when it is of type list seems to be the primary source of the bug.
- The branching logic at the end of the function based on the type of key might not cover all edge cases properly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not correctly handle the case when the key is a list. When trying to access values using a list key that contains no matching index values, the function should raise a KeyError, but it fails to do so due to the way it handles list-type keys.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to properly handle list type keys. Specifically, it should raise a KeyError when the list key does not contain any matching index values.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the issue mentioned in the GitHub post should be resolved, and the failing test cases should pass as expected.
