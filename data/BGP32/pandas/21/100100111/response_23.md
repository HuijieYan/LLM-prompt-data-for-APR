### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` and return the corresponding values from the Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior of indexing when there are no matches in the Series index.
3. The bug surfaces when indexing with a list where it raises a `KeyError` while it should return `NaN` for non-matching index values.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list. The function checks for specific types such as `Index`, `np.ndarray`, etc., but does not handle a list correctly.
- Consequently, when a list is used as an indexer, the function tries to reindex with the list values directly instead of returning `NaN` for non-matching index values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the function to correctly handle list-like indexers by returning `NaN` for non-matching index values.
- Ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers to align with expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(list(key), skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key).combine_first(pd.Series(index=key, dtype=self.dtype))

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Correction:
1. Updated the handling of list-like indexers by reindexing with the list values and filling non-matching indices with `NaN`.
2. Ensured consistent processing of different types of indexers within the function.
3. By combining the reindexed values with a Series constructed from the list index and the original Series dtype, consistency and correctness are maintained.
