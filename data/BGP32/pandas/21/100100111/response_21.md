## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. It checks the type of the key and appropriately processes it. However, there is a specific condition for handling specifically indexed-like objects such as a list, numpy array, Series, etc., which seems to have a bug.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior of accessing a value from a Series using different kinds of index-like objects. In the failing scenario, when a list is used as the key, the function raises a KeyError which is inconsistent with the behavior for other index-like objects.
3. The bug causes inconsistency in how the function handles different types of index-like objects when indexing a Series, leading to unexpected errors in certain cases, as highlighted in the failing test scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like objects consistently with other index-like objects when indexing the Series.

## Fixing the bug
To address the bug in the `_get_with` function, we can modify the logic that handles list-like objects to be consistent with how other index-like objects are treated. Specifically, we need to ensure that when a list is provided as the key, it is processed correctly without raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like objects consistently with other index-like objects
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Removing the separate condition for handling lists
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the logic to handle list-like objects consistently with other index-like objects, we can ensure that the function behaves uniformly across different types of keys, resolving the bug reported in the failing test case.

This correction aligns with the GitHub issue's discussion about the inconsistency in behavior for different types of index-like objects.
