### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalar values, lists, arrays, Series, and Index objects. The bug occurs when a list key is passed in, causing an error in handling indexes and returning the requested values.

The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to verify the behavior when using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series object to index a Series. However, the current implementation of `_get_with` does not handle the list key input correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access a value that does not exist in the Series.

The expected input/output values for the failing test case include different types of key input (list, ndarray, Index, Series), the Series object to be indexed, and the expected KeyError message due to a missing value in the Series.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of list-like key inputs in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is passed, the function should return the requested values without causing a KeyError. However, the current implementation fails to handle this case properly, leading to the erroneous behavior and the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the `_get_with` function that deals with list-like keys. This modification should ensure that the function treats list input in a consistent way with other array-like inputs such as ndarrays, Indexes, and Series. By adjusting the logic to handle list keys in a similar manner to other array-like objects, we can resolve the issue and make the function return the expected values without errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported in GitHub:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the logic to handle list-like keys at the appropriate location in the function and ensuring consistent treatment of array-like inputs, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list input.
