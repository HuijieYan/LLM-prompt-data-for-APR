### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses Series with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and expects an error message if a key element is not found in the Series index.
3. The bug seems to be related to how different types of keys are handled within the `_get_with` function.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior between using list indexers and array-like indexers, especially for cases where the key is not found in the Series index.

### Error Location:
The bug likely occurs when handling the case where `key` is an array-like type but not recognized as `list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes an inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys. Specifically, the current implementation does not handle array-like keys that are not recognized as `list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index` correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when accessing elements not present in the Series index, as shown in the failing test.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all array-like keys are handled consistently and that a KeyError is raised if a key element is not found in the Series index, irrespective of the type of array-like key provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle array-like keys consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle any other array-like keys by converting to Index type
    key = Index(key)

    if key_type in ("object", "datetime64", "timedelta64"):
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By explicitly converting unrecognized array-like keys to the Index type and ensuring consistent error handling for missing key elements, the corrected version of `_get_with` should pass the failing test and address the issue raised on GitHub.
