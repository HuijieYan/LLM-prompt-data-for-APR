### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, there is an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like and Index objects.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to demonstrate the inconsistency of behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers when used with a Series.
3. The expected input and output values for the failing test show that the key is a list containing a value 'C', which is not present in the Series index. The function should handle this case consistently with other types of indexers.
4. The bug is caused by the special handling of list indexers when they are not present in the Series index, leading to a KeyError.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function to align with the behavior of other types of indexers when handling missing values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function:
1. Check if the key is a list-like object before attempting to proceed with list-specific handling.
2. If the key is list-like and not present in the Series index, raise a KeyError to maintain consistency across different types of indexers.
3. Update the code to handle missing values in list indexers the same way as array-like and Index objects.

### Updated Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not any(x in self.index for x in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers when missing values are involved, resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the failing test.
