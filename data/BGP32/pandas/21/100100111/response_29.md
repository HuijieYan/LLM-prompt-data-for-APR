## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is encountering issues with correct indexing when the `key` parameter is provided in different formats such as a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series.
2. The issue is related to handling list-like objects compared to other data structures when indexing the Series object.
3. The failure in the test function `test_getitem_no_matches` is due to incorrect handling of indexing when `key` is of type list, resulting in a KeyError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of key inputs - specifically implementing the correct behavior when provided a list as the key.
5. The corrected version should address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue by ensuring correct behavior regardless of the type of the key.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the `key` parameter first to determine the appropriate indexing behavior.
2. For list-like objects, handle the duplicate indexing case (as mentioned in the code comments).
3. Ensure that the correct indexer and logic are chosen based on the type of key to avoid KeyError issues.
4. Update the function logic to have consistent behavior for different key types, as suggested in the GitHub issue description.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle list-like keys appropriately and ensuring consistent behavior based on the key type, the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
