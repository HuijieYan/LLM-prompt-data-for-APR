## Analysis
The function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for a Series and fetching the corresponding values based on the key type. The buggy function fails in certain cases where an Index object is passed as a key due to handling the key differently for list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers.

In the failing test, a Series key (`key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)`) is converted to different types (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) using the `box` parameter, but the function fails to handle the Index object correctly, leading to a KeyError exception.

The GitHub issue discusses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers for a Series and highlights the specific case where passing an Index object as the key results in a KeyError while other types work as expected.

## Error Location
The bug is primarily located in the part of the code that handles a key of type `Index` where it fails to correctly process the input key.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle the provided key correctly when it is of type `Index`. This leads to the KeyError exception being raised when trying to access the key values from the Series.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the code should handle Index objects like other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different key types. The `_get_with` function should be updated to treat the key consistently regardless of whether it is an Index, list, ndarray, or Series.

## Correction of the Buggy Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle Index objects the same way as other list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Update to handle Index objects correctly now that key is converted to values
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle Index objects correctly by converting them to values before further processing. This change will ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers in the Series.
