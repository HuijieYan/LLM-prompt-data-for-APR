### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers such as slices, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc., for a Series data structure in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access a value from a Series using a key that does not exist in the Series index.
3. The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the Series, leading to a KeyError that is not consistent with the behavior observed when using other types of indexers.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in error handling between list indexers and other array-like indexers when accessing values from a Series in pandas.

### Bug:
The bug arises when a list-like key is passed to the Series in the `_get_with` function, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to a raised KeyError when trying to access a value that does not exist in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys consistently with other array-like indexers.
2. Update the error handling logic to provide a consistent KeyError message for all types of non-existent keys in the Series index.
3. Ensure that the function processes list-like keys correctly without raising an error for valid operations.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key] if is_list_like(key) else self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected `_get_with` function now handles list-like keys consistently with other array-like indexers when accessing values from a Series in pandas. This fix addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and ensures that the function no longer raises a KeyError for non-existent keys while providing a uniform error message.
