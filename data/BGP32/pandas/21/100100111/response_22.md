### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input `key` values in a `Series` object.
2. The buggy function has multiple condition checks based on the type of `key` input.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks for the behavior when the `key` value is not present in the `Series` index.
4. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message.
5. The GitHub issue points out that the behavior is inconsistent when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers.
6. The issue specifically mentions that `ser[list(key)]` behavior differs from other indexers.

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the block of code handling list-like indexers, as indicated by the failing test and the GitHub issue description.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is not handling list-like indexers correctly, causing the test case to fail with a `KeyError`. The inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue is related to this specific case.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers when accessing a `Series` object. This involves updating the code handling list-like indexers to match the behavior of other indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)  # Always convert key to a list

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
1. The corrected code now always converts the `key` input to a list to ensure consistent treatment of list-like indexers.
2. This change aligns the behavior of list-like indexers with other types of indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
3. The correction should now allow the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` to pass without raising a `KeyError`.
