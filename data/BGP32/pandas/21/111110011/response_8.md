## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys passed to a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates that when a list-like key is passed to a Series object, it raises a `KeyError` instead of handling it properly.
3. The error occurs due to the way list-like keys are handled differently from other key types in the `_get_with` function.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of list key types differently than other array-like key types in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is provided, it attempts to access the element directly without proper handling, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list key types properly. We should ensure that list keys are processed in the same way as other array-like keys to maintain consistency.

## Corrected Code:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
     
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the handling of list keys within the `_get_with` function to be consistent with other array-like keys, we can ensure that the correct behavior is maintained when accessing elements from a Series object.
