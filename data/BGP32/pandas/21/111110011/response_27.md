### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys passed for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series object with a key that doesn't exist in the index, and expects a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The failing test uses different types of keys (`list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series`) to test indexing behavior, and the test case with `list` key fails with the `KeyError`.
4. The failing test is related to a GitHub issue regarding inconsistency in behavior when using different key types for indexing.
5. The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different key types, especially when using a `list` key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in how different key types are handled in the `_get_with` function. When a `list` key is used, the function goes into an incorrect block of code that leads to an error in indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of `list` key in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior expected by the failing test. We should ensure that when indexing with a `list` key, it should raise a `KeyError` if the key doesn't exist in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Update the handling for list key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.to_list()

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of the key types within the `_get_with` function, we ensure that a `list` key behaves consistently with other key types when indexing a Series object. This correction should resolve the inconsistency issue highlighted in the failing test and adhere to the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
