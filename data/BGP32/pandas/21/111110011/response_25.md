## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series using a different type of box (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) giving the key 'C'. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised but the current implementation does not raise the error as expected.
3. The error message indicates that the key 'C' is not present in the index, and this discrepancy is related to the different types of keys used for indexing.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency when indexing with different types, and it also shows that the behavior with list key indexers is different than other indexers.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the handling of a list as a key for indexing in the `_get_with` function's logic is different from other index types, such as array-like, pd.Index, or pd.Series objects.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing using different types of keys. We can update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, we can ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series object. This correction should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
