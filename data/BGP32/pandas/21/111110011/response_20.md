Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue lies in the handling of list-like keys. The function does not correctly handle the case when passed an array-like key. This bug is causing the failing test case where a KeyError is expected but not raised.

The bug is due to the inconsistency in how list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series indexers are treated. The code does not handle array-like indexers properly, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. We should modify the code to handle array-like indexers in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle array-like indexers properly
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
```

By modifying the code to handle all types of indexers consistently, we ensure that the function behaves correctly for different input types. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency issue highlighted in the failing test.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
