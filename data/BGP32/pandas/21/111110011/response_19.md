### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is encountering an issue when indexing with a list-like object.
2. The function `_get_with` checks the type of the key to determine the appropriate handling method.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to demonstrate the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a list, compared to other array-like objects.
4. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is expected when indexing with a list but it is not being raised, showing the inconsistency.
5. This bug is related to a GitHub issue that questions the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.
6. The bug occurs when attempting to index a Series with a list, leading to the incorrect handling of the indexing process.

### Bug Explanation:
The key issue arises when a list-like object is used as the indexer. The bug occurs because the code does not handle list-like objects properly, resulting in the failure to raise a `KeyError` when the expected index value is not present in the Series.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code handles list-like objects correctly when indexing the Series. This involves modifying the `_get_with` function to properly raise a `KeyError` when the index value is not found.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalar key that is not recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if the key is an Index
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle integer key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list-like object key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not self.index.is_unique:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    # For other cases, reindex the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function as presented above, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test case without encountering the inconsistency issue.
