## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers (`slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, etc.) to retrieve values from a Series object.
2. The failing test case is trying to retrieve a value from a Series using a list-like object as an indexer, leading to a KeyError.
3. The error message indicates that the behavior is inconsistent between different types of indexers.
4. The GitHub issue addresses the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers properly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access values using a list. This inconsistency causes confusion and is addressed in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. We should update the logic to handle list-like indexers correctly to prevent the KeyError.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Modified this section to handle list-like indexers correctly
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the section that handles list-like indexers, this corrected version ensures that list indexers are processed correctly within the `_get_with` function. This update aims to address the inconsistency highlighted in the failing test and the related GitHub issue.
