## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is causing the test function `test_getitem_no_matches` to fail. The function is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Potential Error Locations:
The specific part of the function that is causing the issue is the handling of list-like keys. The code path for handling a list key is not implemented correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the improper handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When the key is converted to a list, it is not processed correctly, leading to a `KeyError` in the test. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of keys are handled.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are processed correctly in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the function should return the corresponding values for list keys. This will align the behavior with other types of keys and resolve the `KeyError` in the failing test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle non-list-like keys correctly
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list keys correctly
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `_get_with` function above, the bug causing the `KeyError` in the failing test should be resolved. This corrected function ensures that list-like keys are handled properly, aligning with the behavior of other key types.
