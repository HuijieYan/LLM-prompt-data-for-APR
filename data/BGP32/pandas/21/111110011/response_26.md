## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior when using an index that does not match any element in the Series.
3. The error message indicates that when using a Series index to access elements in the Series, a KeyError is expected, but it is not being raised.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, particularly focusing on the behavior with list indexers.
   
## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function is not raising a KeyError when a Series indexer is used, leading to incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function raises a KeyError when the indexer does not match any element in the Series. This behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of indexers and raise a KeyError when necessary, passing the failing test.
