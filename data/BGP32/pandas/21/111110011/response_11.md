Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the issue arises from the `_get_with` function as it does not handle certain index types correctly. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to test the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`), with the expectation that they should all behave consistently.

The specific error message indicates that when using a `list` as an indexer, the function fails to handle the case properly, leading to a `KeyError` because "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle the `list` type indexer correctly, ensuring consistency with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")

```

By allowing handling of `list`, `np.ndarray`, and `Index` types in the same way as `loc`, the issue with inconsistent behavior for different indexers should be resolved. This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers will be treated consistently when used to index a Series.
