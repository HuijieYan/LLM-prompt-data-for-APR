The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The issue is related to treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a KeyError when accessing the Series with a list indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. We can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers properly and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    ...
    
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif is_list_like(key):
            # Ensure that list indexers are properly handled
            if not is_bool(key):
                key = list(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function now properly handles list indexers and prevents the KeyError from being raised when accessing the Series with a list indexer.

This change ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, addressing the underlying issue reported in the GitHub thread related to handling list indexers differently.
