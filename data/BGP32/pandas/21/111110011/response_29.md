After analyzing the buggy function `_get_with`, it seems that the issue arises when trying to handle the case where `key` is passed as a list. The function is not handling the list case appropriately, leading to a `KeyError` in the test due to an inconsistency in how different indexers are treated.

The `if not is_list_like(key)` condition should be replaced with checking if the key is an instance of a list, and the subsequent code should be modified accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By changing the condition to `elif isinstance(key, list):`, we are now specifically handling the case when `key` is a list by calling `self.loc[key]` directly. This modification should address the inconsistency issues and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test cases.
