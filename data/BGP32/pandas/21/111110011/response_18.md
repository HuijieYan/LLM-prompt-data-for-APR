### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of Pandas handles different types of input keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) for indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when a list indexer is passed to the function, leading to an inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

When a list key is passed to the `ser[key]` operation, the function raises a `KeyError` with a message that suggests none of the items in the list are found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other index types are handled by the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. Since the bug is related to the correct handling of list indexers, we should modify the logic specifically for lists to align them with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # Handle all types of indexers uniformly
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as other index types, preventing the inconsistency in error handling that caused the bug.
