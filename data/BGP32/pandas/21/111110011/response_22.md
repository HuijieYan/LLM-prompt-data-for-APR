### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing operations on a Series object. However, the bug occurs when trying to index with a list-like object, where the behavior is inconsistent compared to other index-like objects. The failing test case is related to this inconsistency and raises a KeyError due to a mismatch in how list indexers are processed.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-like indexers
2. Inconsistencies in indexing logic for different types of objects

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the `_get_with` function's handling of list-like indexers. When trying to index a Series with a list (e.g., ser[list(key)]), the bug causes a KeyError due to inconsistencies in how list indexers are processed compared to other index-like objects like arrays or Index objects. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior and results in a test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like indexers consistently with other index-like objects. This consistency will ensure that indexing operations with list indexes behave as expected and do not result in KeyErrors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other index-like objects, the corrected version of the function will address the bug and pass the failing test case.
