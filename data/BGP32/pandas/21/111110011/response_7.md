### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test expects a KeyError to be raised when indexing with a list-like object that has no matching values in the Series index.
3. The error occurs when indexing with a list-like object due to the different handling of indexers in the `_get_with(key)` function.
4. The bug is related to the inconsistency in how list-like indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- When a list-like object is passed as a key to index the Series in the `_get_with(key)` function, it tries to handle it differently from other indexers. This difference in handling leads to the KeyError not being raised as expected in the test.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the handling of list-like objects in the `_get_with(key)` function to align it with other types of indexers.
- Ensure that when a list-like object with no matching values in the Series index is provided, a KeyError is raised as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not self.index.isin(key).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Details:
- Added a check to verify if any elements of the list-like key are present in the Series index using `self.index.isin(key).any()`.
- If none of the elements are present, raise a KeyError with a message indicating that none of the elements are in the index.
- This correction ensures that the behavior of indexing with a list-like object aligns with other types of indexers, leading to the expected KeyError being raised when there are no matching values.
