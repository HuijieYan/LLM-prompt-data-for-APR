### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys passed to the `Series` object for indexing.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is specifically testing the behavior when a key that does not match any index values is passed.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected when indexing with a `pd.Index` or `pd.Series` type key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) are handled within the `_get_with` function. When indexing with a list-like key that does not match any index values, a KeyError is expected to be raised. However, this behavior is not consistent for other types of indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers raise a KeyError when the key does not match any index values. This will align the behavior and expectations for different types of key indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Ensure that all types of indexers raise KeyError if no matches are found
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check for `is_list_like(key)` and raising a KeyError if no matches are found, the corrected function now ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
