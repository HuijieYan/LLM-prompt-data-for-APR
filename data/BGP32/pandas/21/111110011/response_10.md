### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is designed to handle different types of input keys and perform corresponding operations such as slicing, DataFrame indexing, tuple indexing, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series with a key that doesn't match any values in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The error occurs when a key in the form of a list is passed to the Series indexer, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers like np.array or pd.Index.
4. The current implementation of the `_get_with(key)` function does not handle list-like keys properly, leading to the inconsistency and failure of the test case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the handling of index keys when they are in the form of a list. The code doesn't properly handle list-like keys, leading to erroneous behavior that is inconsistent with other types of indexers and causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like key is passed to the Series indexer, it should be handled consistently with other types of indexers like np.array or pd.Index. We can modify the `_get_with(key)` function to correctly handle list-like keys to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'floating']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(is_hashable(k) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, list-like keys are treated the same way as other Index-like key types to provide consistent behavior and properly handle the input key types. This change should resolve the bug and ensure the test case passes successfully.
