### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, tuples, scalars, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access an index that is not present in the series, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The error message indicates that the issue lies in how list indexers are handled differently compared to other types like numpy arrays, indexes, and Series objects. The behavior is inconsistent, leading to the failing test case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency results in a `KeyError` when trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. List indexers should be treated in a similar way as other types like numpy arrays, indexes, and Series objects.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types, reducing the chance of a `KeyError` when accessing non-existent indices. This fix aligns with the intention of the `Series` class and the expected behavior for different indexers.
