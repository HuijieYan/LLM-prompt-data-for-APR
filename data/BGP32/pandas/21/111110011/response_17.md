### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate values.
2. The buggy function fails in handling a list-like indexer, which results in a `KeyError`.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers compared to other indexers (array-like, Index, Series) in the `_get_with` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the list-like indexer is treated similarly to other indexers by converting it correctly.
5. The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not " 
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the indexer passed to the function is properly converted to an index using `ensure_index`, we can handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
