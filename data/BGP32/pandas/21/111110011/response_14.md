### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, arrays, and Series for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior of indexing with different types of indexers like lists, arrays, Index, and Series. The test expects a `KeyError` when trying to access an element that is not in the index of the Series.
3. The buggy function fails to handle the case when the indexer is a list-like object correctly, resulting in the KeyError not being raised as expected.
4. The cause of the bug is due to the different handling of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When using a list-like indexer, it should raise a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition for handling list-like indexers to correctly raise a KeyError when the key is not present in the index.
2. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers like lists, arrays, Index, and Series by aligning the handling of list-like indexers with the expected behavior in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert to list for consistent handling

    # Handle list-like indexers with missing keys
    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function as shown above, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
