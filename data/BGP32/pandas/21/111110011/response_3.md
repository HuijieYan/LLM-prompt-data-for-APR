### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers to retrieve values from a Series object. However, it fails to handle the case of a list-like indexer properly.
2. The failing test is meant to check the behavior of indexing with different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and expects consistent behavior across all types.
3. The error message indicates that when using a list as an indexer, the function fails to handle the KeyError properly.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers and questions the reasoning behind this behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When trying to index a Series object using a list indexer, the function fails to properly return a KeyError when the indexer does not match any values in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle list-like indexers correctly and return a KeyError when the indexer does not match any values in the index. Consistency with other types of indexers should also be maintained.

### Corrected Version of the Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the list indexer is properly handled and keys are converted to an Index object to check for emptiness, we can fix the bug and ensure consistency across different types of indexers.
