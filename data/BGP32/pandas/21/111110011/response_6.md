## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` within the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when a key that doesn't match any index values is used.
3. The error message suggests that the issue lies within the indexing logic when a list-like key is used.
4. The GitHub issue points out inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is used, the function fails to properly handle the case where the key does not match any index values, leading to a `KeyError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when handling keys that do not match any index values. We should modify the logic to correctly handle list-like keys in the same way as other types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        # Handle non-list-like case directly
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        # Convert key to a list if not already a list
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = list(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

```

By ensuring that all types of indexers are handled consistently, the corrected function should now properly handle list-like keys that do not match any index values. This fix should align the behavior with the expected outcome, resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test.
