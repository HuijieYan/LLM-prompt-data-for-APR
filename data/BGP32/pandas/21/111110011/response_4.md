### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series with a key that has no matches in the index.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised as expected when indexing using a list-like key.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers when indexing a Series object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is passed for indexing, the function does not properly handle the case of no matches in the index, leading to a failure to raise a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently and that a KeyError is raised when there are no matches in the index, aligning with the behavior of other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if any(val not in self.index for val in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

By incorporating the fix above, the corrected `_get_with` function will raise a KeyError when attempting to index with a list-like key that has no matches. This change aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
