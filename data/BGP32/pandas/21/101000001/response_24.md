## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is used for slicing and indexing a Series object. The function checks the type of the input `key` and performs different operations based on its type. There are multiple conditional statements to handle different input types such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, numpy.ndarray, etc. 

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` where it tries to access `self.loc[key]` might result in an error if `key` is not list-like.
2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` incorrectly treats `key` as a list when it might not be one.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, list):` may not handle the case properly for a list of keys.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect assumptions about the type of the `key` input in the conditional statements. In some cases, the code doesn't handle the different types properly, resulting in potential errors or incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the conditions accurately reflect the type of the input `key`.
2. Handle edge cases where the type might not match the assumptions.
3. Simplify the logic where possible to make the code clearer and more robust.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            if key_type == "integer":
                return self.loc[key]
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- I have added a check using `is_scalar(key)` to handle scalar values appropriately.
- Used `ensure_index(key)` to convert key to an Index object for consistent handling.
- Simplified the logic for handling different types of keys.
- Corrected the condition for handling lists of keys.

These changes should make the function more robust and handle different input types appropriately.
