The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic for determining the type of `key` and handling different cases accordingly.

The issue arises when checking the type of `key` and converting it into a list if it's not already one. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` is converting `key` into a list which can potentially cause unexpected behavior when dealing with different types of key inputs.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # handle the case for list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray input
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` has been replaced with `elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):` to check for specific types of `key` before handling them accordingly. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of `key` inputs has been updated to improve the accuracy of the function.
