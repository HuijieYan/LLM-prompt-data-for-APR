The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when trying to handle different types of `key` inputs for indexing a Series object. The issue lies in the inconsistent handling of the `key` input based on its type, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to consolidate the logic for handling different types of `key` inputs and ensure that the correct indexing method is used based on the type of `key`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.inferred_type == 'integer':
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version of the function:
1. We use `ensure_index` to ensure that the `key` is converted to an Index object for consistent handling.
2. We directly check the inferred type of the `key` using `key.inferred_type` to determine whether to use `iloc` or `loc` for indexing.
3. The logic for handling different types of `key` inputs is simplified and made more consistent.

By making these changes, we address the bug in the `_get_with` function and ensure that the indexing of Series objects based on different types of `key` inputs is handled correctly.
