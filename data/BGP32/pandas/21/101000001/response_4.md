## Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is attempting to retrieve values from the Series based on different types of keys.
2. There are multiple conditions to handle different types of keys such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, Index, list, etc.
3. The bug seems to be in the logic for handling keys of type integer, where it determines whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing.
4. The bug might cause incorrect indexing and retrieval of values from the Series.
5. A potential fix involves revising the logic for handling keys of type integer to ensure correct indexing.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the logic related to keys of type integer. The function incorrectly decides whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing based on `Should_fallback_to_positional` method.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the indexing method based on the key type. We should ensure that integer keys are correctly handled to avoid incorrect indexing.

## Corrected function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_integer(key) or is_bool(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

In the corrected version, we check if the key is an integer or a boolean before deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing. This ensures correct indexing behavior and resolves the bug.
