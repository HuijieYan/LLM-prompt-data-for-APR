## The buggy function: _get_with

### Issue:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function is trying to handle different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.) and direct the flow of execution based on each type. However, there is a logical flaw when it comes to handling scalar values that are not recognized by the `lib.is_scalar` function.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the mishandling of scalar values in the `key` parameter. The function checks if the `key` is list-like or not, and if it's not list-like, it tries to use `self.loc[key]` to access the value. However, this approach can lead to unexpected behavior if the scalar value is not recognized correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that scalar values are handled properly and that the function does not rely solely on `is_list_like` check to determine the type of `key`.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_scalar(key)` function is used to properly handle scalar values before trying to access them using `self.loc[key]`. This modification ensures that scalar values are treated appropriately within the function.
