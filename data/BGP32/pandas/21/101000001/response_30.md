The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles the key argument passed to it. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object that is not recognized as an indexable type. In this case, the function tries to access the `loc` attribute of the Series object with the key directly, which may not be valid.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key is converted to a valid indexable type before attempting to access the `loc` attribute with it. We can achieve this by converting the key to a list if it is not already one and then accessing the Series object using the `loc` attribute.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to a valid indexable type
    
    if not self.index.is_non_unique:
        key = key if isinstance(key, list) else [key]  # Handle non-unique index case
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added the `ensure_index` function to convert the key to a valid indexable type and handle cases where the index is non-unique. We also included a check to differentiate between integer-based and label-based indexing.
