## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is used within the `Series` class to handle different types of indexing keys. It checks the type of `key` and performs specific actions based on its type. The function attempts to handle cases where `key` is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` variable when it is a list. The function is mistakenly checking if `key` is an instance of Index when it should be checking if it is an instance of a list or similar objects. This leads to improper inference of the type of `key` and incorrect branching logic, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to correct the logic for handling `key` when it is a list. Instead of checking if `key` is an instance of Index, we should check if it is an instance of a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. This will ensure that the correct path is taken based on the actual type of `key`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making this change, the corrected `_get_with` function will properly handle the cases where `key` is a list and avoid the previous bug related to incorrect inference of its type.
