## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas incorrectly handles the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object resulting in potential errors. The function is intended to process different types of keys for indexing a `Series` object, but the implementation has a bug that may cause unexpected behavior.

## Error Location:
The bug in the function arises when it checks if the `key` is not list-like. The issue occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter which leads to the wrong behavior when trying to index the `Series` object.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function `_get_with` is due to the incorrect condition used for handling non-list-like keys. It only checks if the `key` is scalar but it fails to correctly handle other types of list-like objects leading to potential errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to explicitly check for other types of list-like objects (besides scalars) and handle them appropriately. By updating the condition to properly differentiate between scalars and other list-like objects, we can ensure that the indexing operation behaves as expected for all types of keys.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the `key` is list-like and not an instance of `Index` or `Series`, and then convert it to a list if necessary. This approach ensures that all list-like objects are handled properly during the indexing operation in the `Series` class of pandas.
