## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. It checks the type of the key and then performs specific operations based on the type of key provided. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index` but is treated differently than expected.

## Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when checking if the key is of type `Index` within the `_get_with` function. The code snippet `if isinstance(key, Index):` assumes that `key` will be an instance of the `Index` class, but in some cases, `key` might be a list containing instances of the `Index` objects. This leads to unexpected behavior and can result in an error. 

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is due to the incorrect assumption that `key` is always a single instance of the `Index` class. When `key` is actually a list of `Index` objects, the conditional check `if isinstance(key, Index):` fails, leading to an incorrect branch being executed.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where `key` is a list of `Index` objects. We can check if any element in `key` is an instance of the `Index` class and then proceed accordingly. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of whether `key` is a single `Index` object or a list of `Index` objects.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if any(isinstance(k, Index) for k in key):
        key_type = "Index"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first check if any element in the `key` list is an instance of the `Index` class. If so, we set the `key_type` to `"Index"`. This ensures that the function behaves correctly when dealing with lists of `Index` objects.
