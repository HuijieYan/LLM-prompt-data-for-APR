## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of keys passed in for indexing a Series. The function identifies the type of key provided and branches to different behaviors accordingly.

## Identified potential errors:
1. The initial check for `slice` type key seems correct.
2. The check for `ABCDataFrame` type key is incorrect and should raise a `TypeError`.
3. The check for `tuple` type key is correct.
4. The check for scalar values that are not recognized needs correction.
5. The check for `Index` object and `lib.infer_dtype` may be problematic.
6. The check for `integer` key type and deciding between positional and label-based indexing may need adjustment.
7. The handling of `list` key type seems incorrect.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug might be related to incorrect handling of different key types and not following the expected behavior for specific types like `ABCDataFrame` and scalar values.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the type checking for `ABCDataFrame` to raise a `TypeError` as intended.
2. Double-check the handling of scalar values and ensure it follows the expected behavior.
3. Review the key type handling logic and make necessary adjustments.
4. Verify the handling of `Index` objects and ensure it works correctly.
5. Revise the handling of `list` key type to align with the desired behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):  # Corrected for scalar values
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):  # Adjusted for list
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)  # Correct fallback for unknown key types
```

In the corrected version above, the handling of different key types has been adjusted to address the identified potential errors and ensure the function behaves as expected for various input scenarios.
