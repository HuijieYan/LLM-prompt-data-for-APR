## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional checks for the type of `key`. The function is meant to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, but the logic for handling various types of keys seems to be incomplete and incorrect.

The main issue is the conditional branches for checking the type of `key` and deciding how to index the Series accordingly. There are mistakes in the branching logic that determine how the indexing should be performed based on the type of key.

## Bug Explanation
1. The function first checks if `key` is a slice and tries to convert it for slicing the Series accordingly. This part seems correct.
2. The function then throws a TypeError if `key` is an ABCDataFrame, which seems appropriate.
3. If `key` is a tuple, it calls `_get_values_tuple` function which is assumed to handle tuple type keys correctly.
4. The issue arises with the subsequent condition checks. 
   - It incorrectly assumes that if `key` is not list-like (e.g. a scalar), it can directly use `self.loc[key]` which may not be correct.
   - It improperly handles the case when `key` is not of specific types like list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. The conversion to a list in this case might not be the desired behavior.
   - The handling of the `key` type as "integer" might not be appropriate based on how the indexing should be performed.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Revisit the logic for checking the type of `key` and reevaluate how the Series should be indexed based on the type of `key`.
2. Make sure to handle all possible types of keys correctly to avoid unexpected behavior.
3. Ensure that the conditional branches cover all necessary cases for indexing the Series appropriately.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- The handling of scalar keys (`if is_scalar(key):`) has been corrected to use `self.loc[key]` appropriately.
- The branching logic for handling different types of keys has been revised to ensure that each case is handled correctly, including reindexing if none of the specific types are matched.

By following these corrections, the function should now behave as intended and accurately index the Series based on the type of the provided `key`.
