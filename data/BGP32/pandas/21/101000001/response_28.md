There are a couple of potential issues in the provided buggy function `_get_with`:

1. In the condition `if not is_list_like(key):`, it incorrectly checks for not being list-like and then attempts to use `self.loc[key]`. It should handle non-list-like keys differently.
2. The condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` incorrectly checks if the key is an instance of `Index`, but it should be checking for instances of `MultiIndex` as well.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, list):` is redundant since it's already handled in the previous conditions.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        # handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, MultiIndex)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have:
- Updated the condition for scalar keys to directly use `self.loc[key]`.
- Removed the redundant condition `if isinstance(key, list):`.
- Corrected the type checking for `MultiIndex` instances.
- Adjusted the logic to handle different types of keys appropriately.

This should address the potential issues in the original buggy function.
