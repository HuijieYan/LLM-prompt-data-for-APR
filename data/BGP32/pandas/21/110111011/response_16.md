## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the key is a list properly, leading to `KeyError` when the key is a list. This issue is related to how different types of indexers are handled inconsistently within the function.

- In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the `key_type` is incorrectly set to `'string'` instead of being inferred as `'object'`.
- The failing test is checking the behavior of indexing a Series using different types of indexers, and the test fails when using a list as the indexer because of the inconsistency in handling it.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case where the key is a list. This can be achieved by updating the logic for list-like indexers to align with the behavior of other indexers. The key type should be correctly inferred as `'object'` for lists, and the indexing should be handled consistently for all types of indexers.

## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Fix: Updated and corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now handles the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test cases related to indexing a Series with list-like indexers.
