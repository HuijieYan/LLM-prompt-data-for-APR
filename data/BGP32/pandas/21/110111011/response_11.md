## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` is not handling the case where `key` is a list-like object correctly. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access the elements in the `ser` Series with a list key.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` calls the `ser[key]` operation with different types of `box` parameters (list, numpy array, Index, Series). The test expects consistent behavior regardless of the type of the `key` parameter. However, the buggy function does not handle list-like objects properly, leading to the `KeyError` exception.

The relevant variables and their types show that the `key_type` in the buggy function is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which is erroneous and likely causing the issue.

## Bug Explanation
The cause of the bug is the improper handling of list-like objects in the `_get_with` function. When the `key` is a list-like object, the function should return the elements present in the `Series` based on the keys provided. However, due to incorrect type identification and handling within the function, it throws a `KeyError`.

The `KeyError` message indicates that the key values provided are not found in the index of the `Series`. This behavior is inconsistent with how other index-like objects are handled, leading to confusion and failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` is a list-like object, the function retrieves the corresponding elements correctly without causing a `KeyError`. This involves properly identifying the type of the `key` and handling list-like objects as expected.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to check if the `key` is a list-like object and handle it separately from other types. By iterating over the elements in the list-like object and retrieving the corresponding values in the `Series`, we can address the issue of inconsistent behavior and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if the `key` is list-like and handling it properly, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
