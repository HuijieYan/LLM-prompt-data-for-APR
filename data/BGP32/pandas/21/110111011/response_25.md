## Bug Analysis

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs for indexing a `Series`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` passes different data types as `key` (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to the `ser[key]` operation where `ser` is a `Series`.
3. The error occurs when a list-like key is passed. In this case, the function fails to handle the list-like key correctly and raises a `KeyError`.
4. The key issue is related to the handling of list-like keys and the inconsistency in behavior between different key types.
5. The runtime values and types show that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` instead of checking for the list-like key pattern.
6. The issue described in the GitHub post highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with list-like keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. Identify the root cause of the failure for list-like keys in the `_get_with` function.
2. Review the logic for handling different key types and ensure consistency.
3. Update the function to correctly handle list-like keys by reworking the conditions and logic flow.
4. Ensure that when a list-like key is encountered, it is processed appropriately without raising a `KeyError`.
5. Test the modified function with the failing test case to confirm that the issue is resolved.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Ensure list-like keys are handled correctly
        if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        return self.loc[key]

```

By updating the function to handle list-like keys correctly based on their inferred type, we can fix the bug and ensure consistency in indexing behavior.
