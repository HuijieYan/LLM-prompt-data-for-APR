### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle indexing operations based on different types of keys, like slices, DataFrame, tuples, and various list-like objects.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes list-like objects as keys, leading to inconsistencies in behavior and failing the provided test cases.
3. The failing test is aimed at testing the behavior of indexing with a list-like key, where the expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` if none of the items in the key are present in the Series index.
4. The bug appears to stem from treating list indices differently from other indexers like arrays or Index objects, leading to unexpected outcomes and differences in behavior.
5. To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be adjusted to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent treatment of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When encountering a list key, the function does not handle it properly, resulting in incorrect behavior and failing tests.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are processed consistently with other indexers, such as arrays or Index objects. By modifying the conditional logic to handle list keys properly, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_arr = np.asarray(key)
        if not np.in1d(key_arr, self.index).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key_arr} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key_arr)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list keys in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and addresses the bug causing the failing test.
