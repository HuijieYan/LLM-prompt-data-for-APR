Based on the information provided, let's analyze the bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.

### Bug Analysis:
- The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
- The bug seems to be related to how list-like keys are processed differently compared to other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `test_getitem.py` checks for the behavior when using various types of indexers like lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series, with the expected outcome raising a KeyError for a key that is not present in the Series.
- Based on the provided runtime values and types, the bug appears to stem from incorrect handling of list-like keys and may lead to returning an incorrect `key_type`.

### Bug Cause:
- The inconsistency arises when processing list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, causing the KeyError not to be raised as expected for a non-existent key when used with list-like indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other indexers to maintain uniform behavior for indexing operations.
- Modify the conditions for processing list-like keys to align with the desired behavior observed with other indexer types.
- Update the key handling logic to correctly identify the key type and raise a KeyError when a key is not present in the Series.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
Here is the updated version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case for list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the above corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the inconsistent behavior when using list-like keys should be resolved, aligning it with the expected outcome specified in the failing test cases.

Please ensure to test the corrected function with the provided failing tests to verify that the bug has been fixed successfully.
