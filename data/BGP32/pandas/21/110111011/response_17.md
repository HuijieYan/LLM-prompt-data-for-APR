### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when an index key is provided as a list. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when accessing the element at the specified index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, such as array-like indexers or Index objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers appropriately. We should ensure that list indexers are processed correctly, similar to how other indexers like arrays or Index objects are handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers correctly
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made
1. Added `ensure_index(key)` to handle list indexers correctly.
2. Used `key.inferred_type` to check if the key type is integer.
3. Modified the conditional check for key type handling based on the inferred type.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function is now able to handle list indexers appropriately, resolving the `KeyError` issue when accessing elements at the specified index with a list.
