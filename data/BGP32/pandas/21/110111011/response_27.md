## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The `test_getitem_no_matches` test fails when using an Index or Series as the key parameter, resulting in a `KeyError`. The goal is to have consistent behavior for various types of indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The current implementation does not handle all cases correctly, leading to the test failures.

In the `Series` class function `_get_with(self, key)`, the key parameter is checked for its type, and then further operations are performed based on the type of key provided. The bug arises when the key is either an Index or a Series due to improper handling of these types. This inconsistency results in the KeyErrors observed in the failing tests.

## Bug Cause

The key parameter is not properly checked and handled for all possible types it can take, leading to incorrect behavior when the key is an Index or a Series. The specific condition to handle Index and Series types is missing, resulting in the default behavior, which is not suitable for these types.

The failure occurs due to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, causing the KeyError in cases where the Index or Series type key is passed.

## Solution Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key parameter, when being an Index or a Series, is handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. We can update the function to have a specific case for Index and Series type keys, ensuring that the behavior is consistent across all types of indexers.

## Updated Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
        return self._get_values(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version includes a specific block for handling Index and Series type keys, ensuring that they are converted to platform integers and then passed to `_get_values` method for retrieval. This modification should resolve the inconsistency and address the KeyError issues observed in the failing tests.
