## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys passed for indexing. It provides different behaviors based on the type of key received.
2. The failing test cases are trying to index the Series with various types of keys and expect a `KeyError` to be raised if the key is not found in the index.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles non-matching index keys when a `list` is passed as the key. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys, leading to test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a `list` key is passed, it should raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index, aligning with the behavior when other types of keys are used.

## Fixing the Bug:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list keys in the function, we ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when none of the items in the list key are found in the index. This fix aligns the behavior for all types of keys passed for indexing.

This correction should resolve the failing tests related to the inconsistent behavior of indexing with `list` keys.
