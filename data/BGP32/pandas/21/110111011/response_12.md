Based on the runtime input/output values and the failing test cases, we can see that the issue lies in the handling of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The current implementation treats list-like indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all indexers are handled consistently in the function. By checking the type of the key passed to the function, we can appropriately process it for indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like indexers to lists for consistent treatment

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected implementation, we handle all types of indexers uniformly by converting non-list-like indexers to lists before further processing. This ensures consistency in the behavior of indexing with various types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

With this fix, the `test_getitem_no_matches` test should no longer fail, and the `KeyError` should be raised consistently for all types of indexers.
