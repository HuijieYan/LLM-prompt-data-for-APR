## Bug Analysis:

The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. The bug occurs when trying to access the Series with a list-like key that is not recognized properly, leading to incorrect behavior and a KeyError.

The failing test cases provide different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to access the Series object, and for the list-like key, the implementation fails to handle it correctly, resulting in a KeyError.

## Bug Explanation:

- When a list-like key is passed, the function checks for `is_list_like(key)` which returns False for types like Index, ndarray, and Series.
- Consequently, it treats the list-like key differently and tries to handle it as an individual scalar key, leading to a KeyError as the key is not present in the Series' index.
- The code should handle list-like keys properly and perform a reindexing operation to ensure correct behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

- Check the type of the key passed and handle list-like keys appropriately by reindexing.
- Ensure that when dealing with 'list' type of keys, the reindexing operation is performed correctly to align with the Series index.
- Modify the flow to properly interpret and process list-like keys to avoid KeyError and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Handle list-like keys by reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        # For other cases, e.g. scalars
        return self.loc[key]
```

By correcting the function to properly handle list-like keys with a reindexing operation, the Series object will be accessed correctly without raising a KeyError, resolving the issue identified in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
