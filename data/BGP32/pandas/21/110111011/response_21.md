### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of pandas misinterprets list-like indexes, causing inconsistent behavior when accessing elements. Specifically, when using a list-like indexer (e.g., list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series), it fails to handle the case where the key is not present in the index correctly.
   
2. The issue arises due to the different behaviors exhibited by list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function fails to handle list-like key access properly when the key is not present in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the provided function, the conditional statement `elif not is_list_like(key)` should be handling list-like key access. However, it seems to incorrectly attempt to access the element using `self.loc[key]`.
2. The function should handle list-like key access more consistently and appropriately to avoid the `KeyError` during test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the function to correctly handle list-like key access when the key is not found in the index. 
2. Ensure that the function can identify and return the expected output for list-like keys that do not match any index values.
3. Adjust the error handling mechanism to align with the expected behavior when accessing elements with list-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if not self.index.isin([key]).any():
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not in index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check to verify if the key is in the index for list-like keys before attempting to access it using `self.loc[key]`.
2. Updated the error-handling mechanism to raise a `KeyError` explicitly if the key is not present in the index during list-like key access.

By implementing these changes, the function should now handle list-like key access more consistently, preventing the `KeyError` encountered during the test execution.
