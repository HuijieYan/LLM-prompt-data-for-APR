### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with()` is designed to handle various types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Series, for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior when indexing a Series with an index that contains no matching values.
3. The error occurs when indexing with a list-like object, resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers differently from other types, causing inconsistency in behavior.
5. The bug is evident in the handling of a list-like key input, leading to an error due to the incorrect treatment of the key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in how list-like indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with()` function. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like object.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers in the `_get_with()` function. Specifically, treating list-like indexers the same way as other types should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to consistently handle list-like indexers like other types, the bug causing the `KeyError` should be resolved.

This correction aligns with the GitHub issue raised about the inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects compared to other types.
