### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` module is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing elements in a Series. The issue arises when using a list indexer, causing a `KeyError` despite the same behavior not happening with other types of indexers like arrays, Index, or Series.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tests this behavior by trying to access a non-existent element from the Series using different types of indexers. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised for all indexers, but it fails specifically for the list indexer.

Looking at the provided runtime values, it is evident that the key type is being inferred as `'string'` when it should ideally be recognized as an index value for the list indexer.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list, it is not being correctly identified and converted to the corresponding index positions, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements that do not exist in the Series.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are correctly processed and converted to the appropriate index values before attempting to access elements in the Series. This involves updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers properly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not any(is_list_like(val) for val in key):
            key = [np.nan if val not in self.index else val for val in key]
        else:
            key = [self.index.get_loc(val) if val in self.index else np.nan for val in key]
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like indexers properly, the corrected function should be able to handle the failing test case and resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the corresponding GitHub bug.
