## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, it fails to correctly handle the case where the key is a list of items. The issue arises when the key is passed as a list, as in the failing test cases. The function incorrectly infers the key type as "string" instead of recognizing it as a list of items to be indexed.

The buggy function fails to properly process the list key, leading to a KeyError being raised when attempting to access the value. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, such as arrays or Index objects, which work correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly identify and handle list-like keys. Instead of inferring the key type as "string" for list keys, it should treat list keys as indices. The function should appropriately handle list indexers to avoid the KeyError that occurs in the failing test cases.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "mixed-integer"):
        # Treat list-like keys as positional indexers
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles list-like keys by treating them as positional indexers. By differentiating the handling of list keys from other types of indexers, the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
