Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers in the `Series` class. Specifically, the bug occurs when using a list indexer, causing a KeyError when trying to access elements that do not exist based on the index.

### Bug Cause Analysis:
- The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is not handling the case of a list indexer properly, leading to the KeyError.
- When the key is a list, the function does not correctly process it to retrieve the values.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers properly by reindexing them based on the existing behavior for other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.to_list()
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we convert the Index key to a list if it's an Index type. Then, we continue the logic flow based on the inferred dtype of the key. For list keys, we directly handle the duplicate case followed by reindexing the key if needed.

This fix should address the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue about the inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers in the `Series` class.
