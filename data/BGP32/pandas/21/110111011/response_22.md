### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` aims to handle different types of indexers when indexing a Series. The function contains multiple `if-elif` blocks to check the type of the key provided.
2. The bug occurs when a `list` key is passed to the function. It fails to correctly handle the case where the key is a list.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that does not match any values in the index. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series as the key.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list keys in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior expected by the test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list keys in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is provided, the function attempts to iterate over the list elements to access the Series values, which results in a `KeyError` when the key values are not found in the Series index.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the function that handles list keys. Instead of trying to iterate over the list, we should directly use the `loc` method to access the Series values corresponding to the list of keys.

### Updated `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
      
        return self.loc[key]
```

By directly using `self.loc[key]` for list keys, we align the behavior with the expected outcome in the failing test, resulting in a fixed implementation to address the bug.
