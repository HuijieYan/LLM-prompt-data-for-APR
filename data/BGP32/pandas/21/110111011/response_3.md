### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when handling different types of indexers. The function erroneously treats list-like indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior. The failing test cases provide scenarios where using a list indexer leads to a `KeyError`.

1. When a list indexer is passed, the function incorrectly executes the `reindex` method, causing it to raise a `KeyError` due to an incorrect validation check for the index.
2. The bug arises because the function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to different outcomes compared to other types of indexers such as ndarray, Index, or Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle all types of indexers consistently. The approach should ensure that list-like indexers are processed in the same way as other array-like indexers to maintain uniform behavior. Additionally, the validation for indexers should be adjusted to prevent `KeyError` exceptions when using list-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        return self.loc[key]
```

By adjusting the handling of list-like indexers to be consistent with other array-like indexers, the corrected function ensures that all types of indexers are processed uniformly. This correction addresses the inconsistent behavior observed in the failing test cases and resolves the `KeyError` exception triggered by list indexers.
