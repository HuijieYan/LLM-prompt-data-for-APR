### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing for a case where an index with no matches is used to access a Series, causing a `KeyError`.
- The error occurs when the function encounters a key that is a list-like object, causing an inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers.
- In the failing test, when a list-like object is passed as a key (`key = box(key)`), the `_get_with` function is unable to handle it correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the handling of list-like objects in the function `_get_with`. When a list-like key is encountered, the function fails to process it correctly and throws a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like objects are handled consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This can be achieved by updating the logic to correctly process list-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to a list if it is not one
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to properly handle list-like indexers and ensuring consistency across different indexer types, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test scenario.
