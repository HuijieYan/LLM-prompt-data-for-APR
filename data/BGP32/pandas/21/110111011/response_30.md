### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existing keys from the `Series` object. The function contains conditional statements to handle different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.), but the handling of list-like indexers is causing the issue.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of accessing non-existing keys in a `Series` object using different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access a key that does not exist in the `Series`.

During runtime in the failing test, the function extracts the `key_type` as `'string'` regardless of the type of indexer used, indicating that the function is not distinguishing between different types of indexers correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function are not properly handling list-like indexers. When a list-like indexer is provided, the function incorrectly assumes it to be a single scalar value and tries to access it directly using `self.loc[key]`. This leads to a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like indexers. When a list-like indexer is provided, it should iterate over each element in the list to avoid the `KeyError` and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        keys = list(key) if not isinstance(key, list) else key
        return self.loc[keys]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version specifically addresses the issue related to list-like indexers by correctly handling them as a list of keys rather than a single key. By iterating over each element in the list, the function ensures that all elements are accessed individually and avoids the `KeyError` scenario.
