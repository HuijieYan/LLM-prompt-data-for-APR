## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, list-like objects, arrays, and extension arrays.
2. The bug occurs when a list indexer is passed to the function, resulting in a `KeyError` because the function cannot handle it correctly.
3. The failing tests demonstrate that when using different data types as indexers like lists, arrays, data frames, or series, the behavior is inconsistent. Lists raise a KeyError, while other data types behave differently.
4. The expected behavior is that all types of indexers should behave similarly to maintain consistency in how data is accessed from the series.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like objects are correctly handled in the `_get_with` function. We should modify the logic to treat list-like objects in a consistent manner with other data types to avoid the KeyError when accessing data.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, dict)):  # Fix for list-like objects
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the code to handle list-like objects as in a similar manner as other data types, we can ensure consistency in how data is accessed from the series. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` when using lists as indexers.
