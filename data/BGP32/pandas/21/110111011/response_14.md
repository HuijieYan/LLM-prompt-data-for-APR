### Explanation of the Bug

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when dealing with different types of indexers. The issue arises because the function treats list indexers differently from other types of indexers such as array-like indexers. This difference in treatment leads to inconsistent behavior and, ultimately, to failing tests.

In the failing test scenario, the test case uses different types of indexers, such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, to access elements in the series. The `ser[key]` operation works correctly for `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` types but fails for the `list` type, raising a `KeyError` exception with a message indicating that none of the values in the index are present in the specified list.

The reason for this bug is that the `_get_with` function handles different types of indexers in a specific way for `list` objects, which is not consistent with the handling of other types. This inconsistency results in the unexpected behavior observed during the tests, leading to failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should treat all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior is the same irrespective of whether the indexer is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. By aligning the handling of different types of indexers, we can ensure that the function behaves predictably and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub ticket.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary modifications to handle all types of indexers uniformly within the `_get_with` function, we ensure consistent behavior and successfully resolve the issue raised in the GitHub ticket.
