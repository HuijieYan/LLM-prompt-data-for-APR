### Bug Explanation:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the input `key` parameter in the `_get_with` function. The function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object, but it fails to handle cases where the key is not recognized correctly.

In the failing test cases, the function encounters a key value that is not properly identified as a valid type for indexing. This leads to the function attempting to use the key as an index, resulting in a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly identifies and handles different types of keys for indexing. Specifically, we need to address the cases where the key is not list-like or recognized as a valid index type.

### The corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        key = key.values

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures that keys that are not list-like or recognized as valid index types are appropriately handled, preventing `KeyError` exceptions and ensuring correct behavior when indexing a Series object.
