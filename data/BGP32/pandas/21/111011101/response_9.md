### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`. However, in all given cases, the function fails to correctly identify the type of the key provided, leading to an incorrect behavior and causing the tests to fail.

The key issue is with how the function determines the `key_type` based on the input key. The function uses `lib.infer_dtype` to determine the key type, but this method may not accurately identify the key type in all cases.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inaccurate determination of the key type in the `_get_with` function. When the function wrongly identifies the key type as `'string'` instead of `'object'`, it leads to an indexing error because the key type does not match the `self.index` types.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to improve how the key type is determined to ensure correct indexing behavior. We can modify the logic for determining the key type to handle different types of keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ['string', 'floating']:
            return self.reindex(key)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
```

The corrected version includes a more structured approach to determining the key type, allowing for appropriate handling of different key types and avoiding the indexing error that caused the failing tests.
