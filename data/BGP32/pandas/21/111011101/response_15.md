### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is called with a key that is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The function is designed to handle these cases, but there is an issue in the logic flow that leads to an incorrect return statement.

In the buggy function, the variable `key_type` is inferred using the `lib.infer_dtype` function based on the type of `key`. However, the logic that follows in the function does not properly handle the case where `key_type` is inferred as `'string'`. This leads to a wrong return statement and ultimately causes the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where `key_type` is inferred as `'string'`. We should modify the conditional statements in the function to properly branch according to the inferred key type. 

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional statements to correctly handle the inferred key type, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for all input cases.
