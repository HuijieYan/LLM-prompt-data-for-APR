### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with keys of different types. The issue arises when the `key_type` is identified as `'string'` even though the key should be treated as an index or label-based key. This leads to incorrect indexing and a `KeyError` being raised, causing the test cases to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is correctly identified and handled based on its type. We should handle different key types such as lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series to ensure proper indexing without raising errors.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key is correctly handled based on its type, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised during indexing.
