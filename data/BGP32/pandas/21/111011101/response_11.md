### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of `key` inputs, including lists, arrays, indexes, and series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input `key` that is not recognized as a list-like type, leading to an incorrect handling of the key_type.
3. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when indexing a Series with certain key types.
4. Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, the key_type is incorrectly determined as `'string'` instead of the expected type related to the actual key type.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify and handle the different types of keys to ensure proper indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the error message indicating the raising of a `KeyError`, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle different types of keys. Specifically, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled to prevent raising of unexpected errors.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        key_type = "boolean"
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = "list"
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = "ndarray"
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        key_type = "extension_array"
    else:
        key_type = "scalar"

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type identification logic and handling different key types appropriately, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior.
