### Analysis
The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with arrays, indexes, or Series objects. The current implementation does not handle these cases correctly, leading to a `KeyError` exception. The bug happens at the condition where `key` is not list-like.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different types of keys in the _get_with function. When `key` is not list-like, the function attempts to use the 'key' as a location-based indexer, which results in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the _get_with function to correctly handle different types of keys passed to it. The key should be checked for various types, and appropriate actions should be taken for each type.

### Updated Implementation
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By performing these modifications, the function now handles different key types correctly, ensuring that indexing with arrays, indexes, or Series objects works as expected without causing a KeyError.
