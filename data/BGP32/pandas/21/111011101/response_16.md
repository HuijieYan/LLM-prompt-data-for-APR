### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The error occurs when the key is not recognized correctly and leads to a KeyError when attempting to access the Series with the provided key.

1. The function correctly handles the key being a slice object, a DataFrame (raises an error), a tuple (calls `_get_values_tuple`), or a non-list-like scalar (tries to use `self.loc[key]`).
2. The problematic part is when the key is not one of the recognized types and must be processed further. The function checks if the key is a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. If it's not in these types, it converts it to a list. Later, it infers the key's type using `lib.infer_dtype` method, which incorrectly determines the key type to be "string" in all cases.
3. The function then tries to identify if the key should be treated as positional or label-based indexing based on the inferred type, which is always "string" in this case. This incorrect inference leads to the function attempting to index the Series with the wrong type, causing a KeyError.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the incorrect detection or inference of the key type within the `_get_with` function. The key's type is mistakenly inferred as "string" in all cases, which then leads to incorrect handling of the key when trying to index the Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified to enable proper indexing of the Series. We should revise the method used to infer the key type and ensure that it aligns with the actual type of the key being provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the identification of the key type and ensuring it aligns with the actual type of the key being provided, the corrected function address the bug and should pass the failing test cases.
