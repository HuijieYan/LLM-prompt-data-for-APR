### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be located in the section where the key is checked for different types and then routed to the appropriate indexing method. The issue arises when trying to index with a key that is not recognized as a list-like type, resulting in an error message stating that the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Explanation
When the key is not recognized as a list-like type, the function `_get_with` falls back to using `self.loc[key]`, but this can lead to a KeyError when the key is not present in the index. The bug prevents the correct handling of keys that are not list-like, leading to failed tests where the KeyError is not raised as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle non-list-like keys more appropriately. Specifically, we should check if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it. If the key is not present, we should raise a KeyError to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that the non-list-like key is present in the index before trying to access it. If the key is not found, a KeyError is raised as expected.
