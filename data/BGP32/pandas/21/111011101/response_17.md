### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is called with certain types of `key` inputs. The function is designed to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects. However, in the current implementation, there is a type check that mistakenly converts certain key types into lists before processing, which leads to incorrect behavior and causes the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key types are handled correctly without unnecessary conversions. Specifically, we need to remove the incorrect conversion of keys into lists and ensure that the key types are correctly identified and processed according to the intended logic of the function.

### Corrected Code
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the different types of keys correctly and pass the failing test cases.
