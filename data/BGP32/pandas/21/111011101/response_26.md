### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when trying to index a Series object (`ser`) with a key that is not found in the index. The error message indicates a `KeyError`, which means that the key used for indexing does not exist in the Series index. This issue arises when attempting to access a value in the Series using an invalid key.

Looking at the function `_get_with(self, key)`, the bug seems to be related to the handling of non-list-like indexing keys. The function attempts to determine the type of the key and then perform indexing based on the type. In the failing cases, the key type is inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect.

The function has multiple branches to handle different key types, but the bug arises from incorrectly identifying the key type as a string. This results in the wrong path being taken to execute the code, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key being used for indexing in the `_get_with` function. By ensuring that the key type is correctly determined and handled, we can prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate column or index-based access"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling based on the key type and ensures that the indexing is performed correctly without leading to a `KeyError`.
