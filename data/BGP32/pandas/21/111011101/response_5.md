### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. In the failing tests, the function fails to raise a KeyError when trying to access a key that is not present in the Series index. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling non-existent keys.

Looking at the function's implementation, we see that it checks the type of the key and tries to determine the appropriate way to handle it based on the key's type. However, in the case where the key is not list-like, the function directly tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`. This logic is flawed, as if the key does not exist in the Series index, it should raise a KeyError rather than relying on direct access.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case where a key does not exist in the Series index. Instead of directly accessing the key with `self.loc[key]`, we should first check if the key exists in the index and raise a KeyError if it doesn't.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"The key '{key}' is not present in the Series index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing this fix in the `else` block where a non-list-like key is handled, the function should now correctly raise a KeyError when the key is not present in the Series index.
