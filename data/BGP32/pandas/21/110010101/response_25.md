### Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, and performs different operations based on the key type. The bug is likely related to the incorrect handling of the key types within the function, as it fails to correctly index the Series object for certain key types.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly handles different key types, causing it to fail when indexing the Series object. Specifically, when the key is an instance of a Series class, the function does not correctly process it and results in a KeyError.

In each of the failing test cases, the key is converted to a different instance type (list, ndarray, Index, Series) before being used for indexing. The function fails to handle the Series key type correctly, leading to the KeyError during indexing.

To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case when the key is an instance of the Series class and ensure that the correct indexing operation is performed without raising an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case when the key is an instance of the Series class correctly. We should ensure that the function can index the Series object using a Series key without raising a KeyError. This may involve modifying the conditional statements that check the key type and updating the indexing logic for the Series key type.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key.values, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a condition to correctly handle a key of type Series, the corrected function ensures that the Series object can be indexed without raising a KeyError. This fix should now pass the failing test cases and correctly index the Series object using a Series key.
