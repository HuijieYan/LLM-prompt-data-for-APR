Based on the buggy function provided and the failing tests, the main issue seems to be with the handling of keys that are not recognized properly. The key types are not being inferred correctly, which leads to the KeyError being raised in the tests.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the key types are correctly identified and handled within the `_get_with` function. In particular, the key type should be properly inferred before deciding whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`).

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False, index=self.index)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We fixed the inference of key types for lists, Series, and Index objects.
2. We added a check to properly infer the key type considering the Series index.
3. The corrected version should now properly handle different types of keys and avoid the KeyError raised in the failing tests.
