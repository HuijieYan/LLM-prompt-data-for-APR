### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is a bug in the code that causes it to fail when a key of type `Index` is passed.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index`. The function tries to determine the `key_type` based on the inferred dtype of the key. However, when the key is an `Index`, the inferred type is not correctly identified, leading to incorrect branching in the function logic.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if the key is an instance of `Index` separately and handle it differently. We can access the dtype directly from the `key` object and use that to determine the `key_type`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.dtype.name
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly accessing the `dtype` attribute of the key when it is an instance of `Index`, we ensure that we correctly identify the type of key being used for indexing the Series.
