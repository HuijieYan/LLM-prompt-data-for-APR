### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle indexing operations for a Series object. The error occurs when trying to index the Series object with a key that does not exist in the index, leading to a KeyError. The problem arises when attempting to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]` without handling the KeyError appropriately, causing the test to fail.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug occurs due to the assumption that `self.loc[key]` will handle all types of keys properly, leading to a KeyError in cases where the key does not exist in the index. 
2. The bug also arises because the function is not adequately determining the type of key passed and responding accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle KeyError when accessing `self.loc[key]` and ensure that the function correctly determines the type of key being passed. We can do this by checking if the key exists in the index before attempting direct access, and we should handle the different key types appropriately.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling KeyError and ensuring proper key-type checking, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
