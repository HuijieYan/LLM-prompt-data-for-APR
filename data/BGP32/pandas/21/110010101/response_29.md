### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is intended to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, tuples, DataFrames, and lists, and return corresponding values from the Series. However, there are several issues in the function that lead to errors when dealing with certain types of keys.

1. The function checks if the key is a DataFrame (`isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)`), and if so, raises a `TypeError`. This check is causing the error when passing a DataFrame as a key in the failing test.
2. The function incorrectly uses `is_list_like(key)` to check for non-list-like scalars, which should be handled by `is_scalar`. This results in incorrect indexing behavior and can raise a `KeyError`.
3. The function mishandles different key types such as lists, NumPy arrays, ExtensionArrays, and Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to:
1. Remove the check for DataFrames since it is not supported in Series indexing.
2. Replace the check for non-list-like scalars with `is_scalar`.
3. Handle different key types (lists, NumPy arrays, ExtensionArrays, and Series) correctly to ensure proper indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying the corrections mentioned above, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing test cases.
