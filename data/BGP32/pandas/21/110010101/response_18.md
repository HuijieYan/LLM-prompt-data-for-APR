### Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
- The function contains a series of conditional statements to determine the type of the key and then perform the appropriate indexing operation.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of keys that are lists or numpy arrays when performing the indexing operation.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test cases, the key is being converted to different types such as list, numpy array, Index, and Series.
- The bug occurs in the case when the key is a list or numpy array. The function tries to infer the dtype of the key using `lib.infer_dtype`, which returns the dtype as `'integer'` even though the key is a list of strings.
- This incorrect dtype inference leads to the function choosing the wrong path for indexing, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existent key in the index.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should update the logic for inferring the dtype of the key correctly, especially for list-like keys that contain non-integer values.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer', 'mixed-integer-float']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # When the key is not integer-like, treat as positional indexer
    return self.iloc[key]
```

### Explanation of Changes
- We modified the `key_type` inference logic to handle cases where the key contains string values, which are not being correctly identified as non-integer keys.
- By checking for key types 'integer', 'mixed-integer', and 'mixed-integer-float', we ensure that the correct indexing method (loc or iloc) is chosen based on the inferred dtype.
- For non-integer-like keys, the function now defaults to positional indexing using `iloc`.
- These changes should address the bug and ensure that the function correctly handles different types of keys for indexing a Series.
