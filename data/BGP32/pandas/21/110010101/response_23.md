### Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function is responsible for extracting values from the Series based on different types of keys.
2. The buggy function has multiple branches to handle different types of keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, etc.
3. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index` because the function does not handle this case correctly and does not return the expected result.
4. The bug causes the function to misinterpret the key type as `'integer'` instead of `'Index'`, leading to the wrong branch being taken in the subsequent logic.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of `Index` type keys to ensure the correct interpretation of the key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify the branch that handles `Index` type keys.
2. Modify the branch to correctly determine the key type and choose the appropriate way to extract values from the Series.
3. Update the logic to handle `Index` keys properly based on the expected behavior.
4. Ensure that the corrected function returns the expected values and types for all test cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the _get_with function

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = 'Index'  # For Index keys, set the key_type explicitly
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly setting the `key_type` to `'Index'` when the key is of type `Index`, we ensure that the correct logic is applied for such keys. This correction should resolve the bug and make the function return the expected values and types for all test cases.
