### Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is checking the type of the `key` parameter to determine how to handle the indexing operation. However, there are some issues with the type checks and the logic flow within the function:
1. The function should handle a case where `key` is a Series, which is not currently accounted for.
2. The function incorrectly checks for `key` being an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which is not a common use case and should be handled differently.
3. The logic flow of the function needs to be adjusted to properly differentiate between different types of keys and handle them accordingly.

### Bug Cause
The KeyError is raised in the test because the `_get_with` function does not properly handle the different types of keys that are passed to it. This can lead to unexpected behaviors when indexing a Series with different types of keys. Specifically, the function is not correctly handling the case where `key` is a Series object.

### Proposed Fix
1. Change the type check condition for `key` to include `Series`, and create a branch to handle this case properly.
2. Remove the unnecessary and potentially confusing check for `ABCDataFrame`.
3. Adjust the logic flow to correctly handle different types of keys and perform the intended indexing operation based on the key type.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Handle key as a list-like type
        return self.loc[key]

    # Additional handling for Series key
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle key as a list
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific branch to handle a Series key and adjusting the logic flow to properly differentiate between different types of keys, the corrected version of the function should now be able to handle the testing scenarios where different key types are passed.
