### Fixing the bug

#### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the type checking for the `key` parameter is incorrect. The function expects the key to be a list-like object but the current implementation misidentifies some types like ndarray, Index, and Series and does not handle them correctly. This leads to a KeyError being raised when the key is not found in the index.

#### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the type checking logic for the `key` parameter and handle different types appropriately. We can simplify the checks and ensure that the correct indexing operation is performed based on the type of the key.

#### Updated `_get_with` function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # Handling list, ndarray, and ExtensionArray types
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and key not in self:
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not in the index")

    # Handling scalar key types
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

#### Explanation
1. We first check if the key is a list-like object (list, ndarray, ExtensionArray) and perform `.loc` indexing.
2. If the key is a DataFrame, we raise a TypeError.
3. If the key is a tuple, we call `_get_values_tuple`.
4. We then handle non-list-like scalar keys by performing `.loc` indexing if the key is in the index, otherwise raise a KeyError.
5. For other cases, we fallback to reindexing.

This updated function should now correctly handle different types of keys and avoid the KeyError that was occurring in the previous implementation.
