### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there are several issues in the function that are causing it to fail when certain key types are passed to it. The function is not properly differentiating between different key types, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Issues
1. The function does not handle the case where the key is a Series. When the key is a Series, it's treating it as a single value key, which is incorrect. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to index the Series using a Series key.
2. The function is not handling the case where the key is an ndarray properly. It incorrectly identifies it as not list-like and tries to index using `loc` which results in a `KeyError`.
3. The function does not handle the case where the key is an Index. It incorrectly assumes the key is a list and tries to index using `loc` which causes a `KeyError`.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the key is a Series and handle it appropriately for indexing.
2. Modify the condition check for `ndarray` key to be properly handled.
3. Account for the case where the key is an Index and handle it appropriately for indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should properly handle the different types of keys and prevent the `KeyError` that was occurring in the original function.
