### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of inputs for indexing a Series object. However, the bug occurs when the input `key` is a Series object itself. The bug is causing a `KeyError` to not be raised when expected.

### Bug Cause
1. The bug occurs when `key` is a Series object, leading to the `if isinstance(key, list):` block not being executed as intended.
2. In the case where `key` is a Series object, it is not being correctly converted to a list.
3. This issue prevents the correct handling of the input Series object `key`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that when `key` is a Series object, it gets converted to a list to maintain consistency in the function logic.
2. Modify the function to correctly handle cases where `key` is a Series object to avoid the Key Error.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.tolist()
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By including the `if isinstance(key, Series)` check and converting the Series to a list using the `tolist()` method, the corrected function should now handle Series objects as input keys correctly, resolving the KeyError issue.
