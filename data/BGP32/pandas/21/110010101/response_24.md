### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is a method of the `Series` class in pandas that is used to get values based on the input `key`.
2. The function contains a series of conditional statements to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles cases where the `key` parameter is not recognized as a list-like object. This results in a `KeyError` when attempting to access elements from the series using keys that are not present in the index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles non-list-like `key` values and returns the appropriate values without causing an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to correctly handle non-list-like keys by checking if the key is a scalar that is not recognized as a list-like object.
2. If the key is not list-like, return the corresponding value from the series using `.loc` indexing instead of trying to access it directly.
3. Update the function to return the values based on the type of the key to ensure proper data retrieval.
4. Ensure all the edge cases and input types are appropriately handled based on the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing the above corrections, the function should now be able to handle non-list-like keys and return the expected values without raising a `KeyError`.
