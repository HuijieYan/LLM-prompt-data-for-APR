### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. It checks the type of the key and performs specific operations accordingly.
2. The failing test cases provide different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to the function to trigger the bug and check its behavior.
3. The bug is likely related to the type checking and handling inside the function `_get_with`, specifically when dealing with different types of keys.
4. The bug seems to be causing a KeyError when a specific type of key is used, leading to a failed test.
5. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles the type of the key being passed for indexing the Series object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Review the conditions for checking the type of the key in the function `_get_with`.
2. Ensure that each type of key (slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list-like, list, etc.) is properly handled to avoid the KeyError.
3. Make sure that the function can correctly differentiate between different types of keys and perform the appropriate actions.
4. Update the logic inside the function to handle the diverse types of keys as expected by the Series class.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim == 1:
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert ndarray to list for handling

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version above, the function should now properly handle different types of keys when indexing the Series object, and the failing test cases should pass successfully.
