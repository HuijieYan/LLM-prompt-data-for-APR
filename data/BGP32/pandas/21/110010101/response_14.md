### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function inside the `Series` class handles different types of input keys (slices, DataFrames, tuples, list-likes, etc.) to return the corresponding values from the Series.
2. The bug seems to occur when the key is a Series object and is converted to an Index object. The function is not handling this case correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access the value from the original Series using the converted Index.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the key transformation is causing the issue. The transformation happens when `key = box(key)` where `box` can be a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. The issue arises when `key` is a Series and is then converted to an Index object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a Series, we extract the underlying values and then continue with the logic appropriately.

### Solution:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = getattr(key, 'array', key)  # Extract underlying array for Series
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding `key = getattr(key, 'array', key)` to extract the underlying array for a Series object, we can prevent the key transformation issue and handle Series objects correctly in the `_get_with` function.
