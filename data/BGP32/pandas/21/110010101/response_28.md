### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys used for indexing a Series.
2. The error message indicates that when passing a key that does not exist in the Series index, a `KeyError` should be raised, but it is not being raised.
3. The function checks for various cases such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, ndarray, etc., to decide on how to handle the key.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic when handling non-list-like keys (e.g., scalars).
5. The function should return `self.loc[key]` when the key is not list-like but is a valid index value.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when the key is not list-like, the function tries accessing `self.loc[key]` regardless of the key's existence in the Series index. This leads to incorrect behavior when the key is not within the index, failing to raise the expected `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should update the function logic to always check if the key is in the Series index before attempting to access it. If the key is not in the index, then raise a `KeyError`. If the key is a valid index value, then return `self.loc[key]` as intended.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is in the Series index
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle keys that are not list-like and raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the Series index.
