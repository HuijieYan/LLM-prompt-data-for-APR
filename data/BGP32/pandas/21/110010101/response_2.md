### Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is used for retrieving values based on different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, and other types. It is designed to handle various types of keys and return the corresponding values from the series.
2. The failing test is checking the behavior when indexing the series with a key that does not exist in the series. The error message indicates that a KeyError is expected but not raised.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of non-existent keys, where the function should raise a KeyError but is not doing so.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key does not exist in the series, the function correctly raises a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check if the key exists in the series before attempting to retrieve values.
- If the key does not exist, raise a KeyError.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(self.index == key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return self[key]
```
