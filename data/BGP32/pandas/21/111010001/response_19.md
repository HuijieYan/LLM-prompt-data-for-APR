## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of keys to retrieve values from a `Series`.
2. The failing tests indicate that `KeyError` is not being raised when an invalid key type is passed to the `Series`.
3. The code identifies the key type and tries to return values based on that, but it seems there is an issue with handling certain key types.

## Potential Error Location
The issue might be in the section where the key type is checked and processed to return values from the `Series`.

## Cause of Bug
The bug is likely caused by an improper handling of key types in the `_get_with` function. When a key of type `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, or a list-like object is passed, the function is not returning the expected `KeyError`, leading to test failures.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of key being passed.
2. Check for key types that are not supported and raise a `KeyError` in those cases.
3. Handle different key types appropriately to return the values from the `Series`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"KeyError: {key}")

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        try:
            key = ensure_index(key)
        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            raise KeyError(f"KeyError: {key}")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added an explicit check for key types that are not supported and raised a `KeyError` in those cases. I also handled the case where the key is not list-like separately to raise a `KeyError`. Additionally, I ensured that the key is converted to an index if required before processing it further.
