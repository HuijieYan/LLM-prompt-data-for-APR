### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_get_with(self, key)` inside the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
2. The function is trying to perform indexing on a Series based on the type of the key provided.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is failing to raise a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a key that is not present in the index.
4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys and index matching.
5. We need to ensure that the function correctly raises a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that is not in the index.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function does not correctly handle the case where the key provided is not present in the index of the Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the key is in the index before attempting to retrieve the value.
2. Raise a `KeyError` when the key is not in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
    
    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now correctly handles the case where the key provided is not present in the index and raises a `KeyError` with an informative message. This correction should resolve the issue of not raising a `KeyError` when attempting to access a key that is not in the index.
