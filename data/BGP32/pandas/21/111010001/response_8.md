1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class from the Pandas library. This function is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The error messages indicate that there is an issue related to the key parameter being passed to the indexing operation.

2. The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function could be in the section where the type of the key is being checked and handled.

3. The bug seems to be related to how the key parameter is being handled within the function. The error messages suggest that when the key is a DataFrame, an Index, or a Series object, the indexing operation fails to appropriately handle these cases, resulting in a KeyError. This issue arises due to the incorrect handling of different types of keys during the indexing operation.

4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles different types of keys for indexing a Series object. Specifically, we should modify the section of the function that checks the type of the key and determines how to index the Series based on the key type.

5. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # isEqual(com.is_bool_indexer) check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the issue of indexing a Series object with different types of keys and prevent the KeyError from occurring in the failing test cases.
