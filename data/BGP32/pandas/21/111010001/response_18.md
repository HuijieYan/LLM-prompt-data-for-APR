1. The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file. This function is responsible for handling different types of keys and returning the corresponding value from the Series object. The failing test is related to indexing a Series using different types of keys, such as lists, arrays, Index, and Series.

2. The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are:
   - Incorrect handling of different types of keys, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.
   - The logic for determining the key_type and selecting the appropriate indexing method might be flawed.

3. The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles keys of different types. The failing test is attempting to index a Series object with a key that is not present in the index. The bug is likely in the logic that determines how to handle different types of keys, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the value with the given key.

4. To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to accurately handle different types of keys and ensure that the correct indexing method is used based on the key type. Specifically, it should handle cases where the key may not be present in the index without raising a KeyError. Additionally, the function should correctly determine the type of the key and choose between positional indexing (`iloc`) and label-based indexing (`loc`) accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or len(key) == 0:
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper handling for keys of different types and ensures that indexing works correctly without raising a KeyError, even when the key is not present in the index.
