1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a `Series`. However, based on the failing test messages, it appears that the function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is an instance of a list, array, index, or Series.

2. The bug in the function may be related to how it is treating different types of keys and the logic used to determine the appropriate action for each type.

3. The failing test messages indicate that the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected when indexing with a key that is an instance of list, np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series. This suggests that there is a logic error in the `_get_with` function related to handling these types of keys.

4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where the key is a list, array, index, or Series. This may involve adjusting the logic used for determining how to index the `Series` based on the type of key provided.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle provided key types - list, array, index, series
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version explicitly handles the cases where the key is a list, np.array, Index, or Series by using `self.loc[key]` instead of attempting further type conversion. This should ensure that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test.
