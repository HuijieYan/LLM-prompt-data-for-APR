### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs and perform the appropriate action based on the type. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling certain key types (such as lists, ndarray, Index, Series) correctly, which leads to a `KeyError` when accessing the Series with those keys.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the final condition where key is not recognized as a list-like object and is falling into the last `else` block, which is calling `self.reindex(key)`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of key types in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The key needs to be recognized as a list-like object in order to avoid the `KeyError` when accessing the Series with those keys.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for key types that are not list-like and convert them into a list.
2. Ensure that the key is recognized as a list-like object before calling `self.reindex(key)`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert to list-like object

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring conversion to list-like object for keys that are not recognized as list-like, we can address the bug that was leading to the `KeyError`.
