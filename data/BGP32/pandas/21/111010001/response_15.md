## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for getting values based on different types of keys. The errors are related to the handling of keys that are not found in the index.

### Issues:
1. The function incorrectly handles the key when it is not found in the index and raises a `KeyError`. This is causing the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function is trying to access values based on the key provided, but it is not handling the case where the key is not present in the index correctly. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised instead of handling it gracefully.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where the key is not found in the index by checking if the key is present in the index before trying to access it.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if key is not found in the index
    if not self.index.isin(key).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to see if the key is present in the index before accessing it, we can avoid the `KeyError` and ensure that the function behaves correctly.
