### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of the key and based on its type, it performs different operations like slicing, checking for data type, handling scalar values, etc. The error occurs when trying to index a Series with a key that is not found in the index, resulting in a `KeyError`. The error message indicates that the series is not handling the indexing operation correctly for certain key types.

The problem seems to be with the logic of checking the key type and then routing the operation accordingly. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `_get_with` function is not raising the expected `KeyError` when indexing with certain key types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of key types in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly distinguishing between different key types like lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects. This leads to incorrect operations and the failure to raise a `KeyError` when indexing with certain key types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly classify and handle different key types. We should ensure that the function properly routes the operation based on the key type and raise a `KeyError` when a key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added a try-except block to handle the KeyError when indexing with a key that is not found in the index. This modification ensures that the function raises a `KeyError` as expected in such cases.

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases by correctly handling indexing operations with different key types and raising the appropriate errors when needed.
