### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of indexing involving a key.
2. The failing test indicates a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when trying to index a `Series` object with a key that does not match any values in the index.
3. The specific error messages are indicating that the key being used is a `Series` object, resulting in the `KeyError` not being raised.
4. The bug in the function seems to be related to how it handles different types of keys, especially when the key is a `Series` object.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys that are not list-like, but are still valid for indexing, are correctly handled.

### Fix:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check using `is_scalar(key)` to handle single scalar key values correctly, the corrected function should now handle a wider range of key types for indexing the `Series` object.
