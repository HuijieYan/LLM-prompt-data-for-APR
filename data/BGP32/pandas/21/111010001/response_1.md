## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when trying to index the Series using a list, numpy array, Index, or another Series object. The bug seems to be related to the way the key is being handled before indexing.

## Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the way the key is being converted and processed before indexing. There are multiple conditions for handling different types of keys, but the logic for handling list, numpy array, Index, or Series objects is faulty and leads to an error.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Identify the intended behavior for handling different types of keys, such as lists, numpy arrays, Index, and Series objects.
2. Ensure that the conversion of the key to the appropriate format is done correctly for each type of key.
3. Make sure that the returned values from each condition are consistent with the expected behavior for indexing a Series object.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = properties.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic for handling different types of keys, ensuring that the key is correctly processed and the appropriate indexing operation is applied. This should fix the bug and allow the function to pass the failing test.
