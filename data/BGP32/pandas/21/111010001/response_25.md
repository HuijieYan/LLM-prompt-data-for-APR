### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the function is not correctly handling the case where the key is a list, numpy array, Index object, or Series object.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The part of the code that deals with handling different types of keys incorrectly handles the case for lists, numpy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
2. The `elif not is_list_like(key):` block of code might not correctly handle the key that is a list, numpy array, or another object.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function is not properly handling the situation when the key parameter is a list, numpy array, Index object, or Series object. This results in a KeyError when trying to access elements that do not exist in the Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case when the key is a list, numpy array, Index object, or Series object. We should ensure that the function can properly index the Series based on these input types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key] if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else self.loc[list(key)]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By properly modifying and updating the logic for handling key types in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version addresses the bug and ensures that the function indexes the Series correctly based on the input key type.
