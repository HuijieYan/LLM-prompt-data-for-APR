### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The bug is likely related to how the function is handling the `key` parameter and its different types.
3. The error message indicates that when trying to index the `Series` with a key that is either a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the key parameter's type within the function, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing.
5. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different types of keys, ensuring that the correct behavior is applied based on the type of key provided.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now properly handles different types of keys for indexing the `Series`.
- Lists, numpy arrays, and pandas Series are directly indexed using `loc`.
- If the key is an integer, it checks whether to use `loc` or `iloc` based on the index type and fallback conditions.
- The duplicated indexing case is also handled properly.
- The corrected version should now pass the failing test and correctly raise a `KeyError` when expected.
