### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of the pandas module is responsible for retrieving values based on different key types.
- The failing test suggests that there is a KeyError being raised when trying to index a Series with a key that is not present in the Series index.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because when the key is not list-like and is not recognized as a scalar or boolean, the function tries to locate the value directly using the `self.loc[key]` which raises a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if the key is present in the index before directly accessing it. If the key is not present, raise a KeyError with an appropriate message.
- Handle the case where the key is not present in the index gracefully.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(val in self.index for val in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now checks if the key is present in the index before trying to access the value directly. If the key is not present, it raises a KeyError with an appropriate message.
- With this fix, the function should handle cases where the key is not present in the index more gracefully and prevent the KeyError from being raised during indexing.
