### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is expecting `key` to be a list-like object for indexing a Series. However, in the failing tests, the `key` is being passed as a `pd.Index` or a `pd.Series` object, which is causing a `KeyError`. The function is designed to handle list-like keys but fails when receiving non-list-like keys.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with(key)` function expects the `key` parameter to be list-like for indexing the Series, but it doesn't handle situations where the `key` is passed as a `pd.Index` or a `pd.Series` object. This causes a `KeyError` when trying to access elements of the Series based on these types of keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with(key)` function to handle cases where the `key` is passed as a `pd.Index` or a `pd.Series` object. We can modify the function to check if the `key` is list-like. If it's not list-like, we can convert it to a list before indexing the Series.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert the key to an Index if needed

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first use `ensure_index()` to convert the `key` parameter to an Index object if it's not already one. Then, we check if `key` is list-like, and if not, we convert it to a list before further processing. This modification allows the function to handle scenarios where non-list-like objects are passed as keys for indexing a Series.
