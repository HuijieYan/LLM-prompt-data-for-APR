## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function checks the type of the key and performs specific actions based on the type. The failing test cases indicate that the function is not handling all key types correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Error Location:
The bug is likely in the part of the function that handles key types other than slice, ABCDataFrame, and tuple. Specifically, the float type key is not being handled properly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle keys that are not list-like. When encountering a key that is not list-like, it tries to use the key as a label-based indexer (`self.loc[key]`), which can cause a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle keys that are not list-like in the `_get_with` function. We should first check if the key is not list-like before attempting to use it as a label-based indexer. If the key is not list-like, it should be treated as a positional indexer (`self.iloc[key]`).

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # Convert to list
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other key types
    return self.iloc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that non-list-like keys are treated as positional indexers and should address the `KeyError` issue in the failing test cases.
