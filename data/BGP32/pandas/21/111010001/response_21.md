## Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class
The buggy function `_get_with()` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library. This function is used to implement indexing operations on a Series object. The purpose of this function is to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values from the Series object. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that an incorrect behavior is occurring when indexing with certain data types.

## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The conditional block for handling non-list-like keys could be causing the issue.
2. The logic for treating the key as positional or label-based indexer based on the key type might not be working as expected.
3. The block for inferring the key type and deciding between `iloc` and `loc` indexing could be problematic.
4. The block for handling duplicate indexing case might also need attention.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of certain key types which is leading to incorrect behavior in the indexing operation specifically when using certain data types like `list`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. The function should correctly identify the type of key and perform the appropriate indexing operation but seems to be failing in some cases.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
1. Make sure that the logic around key type identification and deciding between `loc` and `iloc` indexing is correct.
2. Ensure that the function can handle different types of keys such as lists, numpy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects correctly.
3. Verify that the function can handle edge cases like duplicate indexing properly.
4. Align the behavior of `_get_with()` with the expected behavior of indexing operations in a pandas Series to fix the bug.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        pass
    else:
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic within the `_get_with()` function as shown above, the function should be able to correctly handle different types of keys and perform the corresponding indexing operations. This corrected version should resolve the issues seen in the failing tests.
