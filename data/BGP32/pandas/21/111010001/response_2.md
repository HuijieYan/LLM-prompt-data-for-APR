### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, there are some issues with the implementation which are leading to KeyErrors during testing. The function is struggling to correctly identify the type of key being passed and select the appropriate indexing method.

### Error:
When key is passed as a Pandas Series, List, Numpy Array, or Pandas Index, the function fails to handle the indexing correctly and raises a KeyError during testing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly identifying the key type and is not selecting the appropriate indexing method based on the key type.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the key being passed for indexing.
2. Utilize the provided Pandas methods like `loc`, `iloc`, and `reindex` to perform the indexing based on the key type.
3. Ensure that the key is converted to the correct type before applying indexing operations.
4. Handle different key types appropriately to avoid KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, slice)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issues with handling different types of keys for indexing a Series and should pass the failing tests.
