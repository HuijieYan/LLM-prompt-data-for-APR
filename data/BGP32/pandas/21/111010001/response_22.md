### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys to access elements in the series.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the bug occurs when attempting to access an element using a key that is not present in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling certain key types, such as `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`.
4. The cause of the bug is likely due to incorrect key handling when checking the type of the key and deciding whether to use `loc`, `iloc`, or `reindex`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case when the key type is `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`. We need to check if the key exists in the index before trying to access the element to prevent `KeyError`. We should also ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and that the appropriate index access method is used (`loc`, `iloc`, or `reindex`).

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else pd.NA  # Check if key is in the index

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key] if all(k in self.index for k in key) else pd.NA  # Check if all keys in index
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key] if all(k in self.index for k in key) else pd.NA  # Check if all keys in index

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added checks to ensure that the key being accessed is present in the index before attempting to retrieve the element. Additionally, we handle cases where we need to check if all keys in a list are present in the index. This should prevent the `KeyError` from occurring in the failing tests.
