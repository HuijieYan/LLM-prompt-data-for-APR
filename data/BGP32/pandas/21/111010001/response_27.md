### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is intended to handle various types of input keys such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, etc. and perform the corresponding indexing operations. However, the bug occurs when trying to index the Series with a key of type `Index`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is caused by not handling the key of type `Index` correctly in the `_get_with` function.
2. When trying to get the value with a key of `Index` type, it doesn't follow the correct logic flow to extract the values from the Series.
3. The incorrect handling of the `Index` type key leads to a KeyError when accessing the `ser[key]` in the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the input `key` is of type `Index` and handle it appropriately.
2. Address the correct logic for extracting values based on the type of `key`.
3. Ensure that the Series can be indexed properly with various input types, including `Index`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values  # Extract values from Index

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By extracting the values from the `Index` type key and following the correct logic flow, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle indexing with a key of type `Index`. This should resolve the KeyError issues in the failing test cases.
