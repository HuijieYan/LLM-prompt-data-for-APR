### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys and returning the corresponding values from the Series.
- The failing test indicates that when passing an Index object (`pd.Index`) as the key, a `KeyError` is not raised even though it is expected.
- The bug is likely related to the condition where an Index object is being checked, as it's not being handled correctly.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the condition where an Index object is being checked is currently not being handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. 
- The code should check for the `Index` object type and handle it properly to avoid the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
- Modify the conditional check for `Index` type and ensure it is handled properly in order to return the correct result.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the Index type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific handler for the `Index` type and using `ensure_index` to handle the Index object, we ensure that the correct result is returned when an Index type key is passed to the `_get_with` function.
