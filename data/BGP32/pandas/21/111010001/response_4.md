### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values.
2. The function checks the type of the input key and performs different actions based on the type.
3. The error message in the failing test indicates that the function is failing to raise a `KeyError` when indexing with a key that is not present in the `index`.
4. The bug might be related to how the function handles the key types and how it interacts with the `index` of the Series.
5. The bug could be in the logic where it tries to perform label-based or positional indexing based on the inferred type of the key.

### Bug:
The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it is not handling the case where the key is of type `Index` properly, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to get items that do not exist in the index. This is causing the function to not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that when the key type is `Index`, the function should handle it correctly to raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index. We can modify the logic to handle the `Index` case separately and raise a `KeyError` when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        if not key.isin(self.index).all():
            raise KeyError(f"Some of {key} are not in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if not pd.Index(key).isin(self.index).all():
        raise KeyError(f"Some of {key} are not in the index")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check `if not key.isin(self.index).all()` and raising a `KeyError` in case of missing values in the index when the key is of type `Index`, we ensure that the function behaves correctly and raises the expected error when trying to access keys not present in the `Series` index.
