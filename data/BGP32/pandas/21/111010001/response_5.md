### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing.
2. The error occurs when trying to index the `Series` with a key that should raise a `KeyError`.
3. The error message indicates that the key being used for indexing is not found in the index of the `Series`.
4. The bug is likely related to how the key is being processed before indexing.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the key being used for indexing first.
2. Handle different types of keys appropriately by following the expected behavior for each type.
3. Ensure that the key is a list-like object before further processing it.
4. Avoid errors related to indexing by properly handling cases where the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar keys to a list
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking the type of the key first and ensuring it is a list-like object before further processing, the corrected function should now handle different key types correctly and not raise a `KeyError` when indexing the `Series`.
