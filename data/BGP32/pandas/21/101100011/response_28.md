## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` module is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the series. However, the bug arises when the function encounters a `list` key, which leads to an error in the behavior of how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

## Issue:
The issue arises due to the inconsistent behavior of how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers. The bug affects the handling of list key access within the `_get_with` function.

## Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the section of the function where `list` key type is not properly handled compared to other index types.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not correctly handle list key access, leading to a KeyError exception when trying to index with a list key. This behavior conflicts with the expected behavior and results in inconsistent treatment of list indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list key access is handled consistently with other index types within the `_get_with` function. This involves updating the logic to properly handle list key indexing.

## Proposed Fix:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list key access
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Convert list key to array-like key for consistency
        key = np.array(key)

    # Handle all other array-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, Series, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # Handle any other non-index array-like key
        key = np.array(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup-indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By including the corrected code above, the bug related to handling list key indexing within the `Series` class in the `pandas` module is fixed. The corrected version ensures consistent treatment of list key access compared to other array-like indexers as intended. This fix should resolve the issue identified in the GitHub report and pass the failing test case provided.
