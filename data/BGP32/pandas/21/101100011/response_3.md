### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library has an issue with how it handles indexing using a list. This bug is related to the difference in behavior when indexing using different types of objects like lists, arrays, indexes, and Series.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the section of the code where different types of `key` are being checked, and inconsistent behavior is observed based on the type of `key` provided.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series object with different types of indexers like lists, arrays, indexes, and Series. The problematic part of the code is when a key of type list is handled differently compared to other types, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when indexing a Series object. Specifically, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers to align with the behavior of other types like arrays, indexes, and Series.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key) and len(key) > 0:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrects the inconsistent behavior based on the type of indexer like list, array, index, or Series when indexing a Series object. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
