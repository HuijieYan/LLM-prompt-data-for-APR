## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a `Series`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexing with a list type key.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of indexing a `Series` with various key types including list, array, `Index`, and `Series`.
3. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing a `Series` with a list key compared to other key types. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when using a list key but not with other key types.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for indexing with all key types. One possible strategy is to modify the section of the code handling the list key to align it with the behavior of other key types.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the code to handle list keys in a consistent manner similar to other key types, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the inconsistency issue and pass the failing test.
