## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is not handling the case when a list-like key is passed for indexing. This leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers such as arrays or `pd.Index`, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Potential Error Locations:
The error in the buggy function `_get_with` can be caused by not correctly handling the list-like key indexing case, leading to a KeyError when trying to access an index that does not exist.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list-like key is passed, the function does not handle it properly and results in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers like arrays or `pd.Index`, as highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like keys correctly, similar to how it handles other types of indexers like arrays or `pd.Index`. This involves modifying the logic inside the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys by using `loc` or other appropriate methods.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this fix, the `_get_with` function now correctly handles list-like keys, ensuring consistent behavior with other types of indexers. This corrected version should address the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
