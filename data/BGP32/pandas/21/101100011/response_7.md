## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is designed to handle different key types for indexing. 
2. The buggy function specifically has an issue when dealing with list-like keys that contain values not present in the index of the Series.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates this issue by expecting a KeyError with a specific message when using a list key containing values not in the Series index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers, where list indexers behave differently from array-like indexers, leading to confusion and unexpected results.
5. The bug arises from the implementation of how list-like keys are handled when they don't match any values in the Series index.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including list-like keys, behave consistently when dealing with values not present in the Series index.
2. We can follow the behavior expected by the failing test and make sure that a specific KeyError is raised with a message indicating that none of the values in the key are present in the index.
3. By handling the list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, we can improve the predictability of the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) > 0 and all(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will behave consistently when faced with list-like keys that don't match any values in the Series index, resolving the bug and aligning the behavior with the expectations set by the failing test and the GitHub issue.
