Based on the provided information, let's analyze the buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file:

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The function seems to handle different types of `key` differently, such as handling a list-like key separately.
2. Multiple conditional statements based on the type of `key` might lead to incorrect handling of certain cases.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers in a Series. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is expecting consistent behavior for list/ndarray/Index/Series indexers, but the `_get_with` function is not handling the list-like key correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with(key)` handles all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) consistently and correctly. Specifically, the handling of list-like keys needs to be adjusted to match the expected behavior in the failing test case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
