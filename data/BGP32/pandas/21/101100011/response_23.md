## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class handles different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, lists, and arrays. The bug seems to occur when a list-like indexer is passed to the function. The current implementation does not handle list-like indexers correctly, causing an issue when indexing the series.

## Error Location:
The bug in the `_get_with` function causes incorrect behavior when a list-like key is passed. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` triggers for list-like keys, but the subsequent `self.loc[key]` operation does not handle this case properly for a list key.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation does not consider list-like keys correctly in the `elif not is_list_like(key)` condition. Therefore, when a list key is provided, it tries to access using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError as shown in the failing test.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that the indexing operation for list keys is done correctly based on the provided key type.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys appropriately and pass the failing test, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
