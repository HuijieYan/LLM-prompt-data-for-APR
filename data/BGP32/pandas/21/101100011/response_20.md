## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is not handling the case where the `key` is a list-like object correctly. It fails to handle list-like objects, which leads to a KeyError in some scenarios, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Identified Potential Errors:
1. The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `key` is a list-like object.
2. There is a missing condition to check for list-like objects before processing.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not have a specific condition to handle list-like objects, causing it to fall back to incorrect behavior and potentially lead to a KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the `key` is list-like before processing it.
2. Handle list-like objects differently within the function to avoid the KeyError.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition `if is_list_like(key):`, the corrected version of the function will correctly handle list-like objects and prevent the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
