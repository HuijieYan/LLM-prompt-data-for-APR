## Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
- The function checks for the type of key and performs specific operations based on the type of key provided.
- The function fails to handle the case where a list-like key is passed, resulting in a `KeyError` when indexing a `Series`.
- The related failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a `Series` using a list-like key and expects a specific message (`KeyError`) to be raised.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a `Series` with different types of key inputs, specifically mentioning the discrepancy with list-like keys.

## Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of a list-like key input in the `_get_with` function.
- When a list-like key is provided, the function does not properly handle it, leading to the `KeyError` exception.
- Due to this incorrect handling, the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` fails when trying to index a `Series` with a list-like key.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function properly handles list-like keys when indexing a `Series`.
- We should modify the implementation to correctly process list-like keys and avoid the `KeyError` being raised.
- By updating the logic to handle list-like keys similar to other types of valid keys, we can align the behavior and fulfill the expectations of the failing test case.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        elif key_type == "object":
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

## Summary
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like keys for indexing a `Series`.
- The fix ensures that the function behaves consistently across different types of key inputs, resolving the `KeyError` issue and aligning with the expectations of the failing test case.
- By updating the logic to appropriately process list-like keys, the bug is fixed, and the function should now pass all relevant test cases.
