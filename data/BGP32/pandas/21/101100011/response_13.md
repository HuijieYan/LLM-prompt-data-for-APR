## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle indexing operations for a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series).
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of different types of indexers when used with `ser[key]`. It expects consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
4. The GitHub issue raises a concern about inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers in `ser[key]` and `ser.loc[key]`, suggesting that the behavior should be made consistent.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- When using a list indexer (e.g., `list(key)`), the function defaults to `self.loc[key]`, which leads to the KeyError raised in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers to align with user expectations and address the concerns raised in the GitHub issue.
- Modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers uniformly to avoid the KeyError issue.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Unified handling for all types of indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

## Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures uniform handling of different types of indexers, resolving the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue. The fix aligns the function's behavior with user expectations and maintains consistency across all types of indexers.
