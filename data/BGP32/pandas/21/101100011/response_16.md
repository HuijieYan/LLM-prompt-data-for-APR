### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `test_getitem.py` utilizes a key value that triggers a KeyError, indicating an issue with the indexing behavior.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling indexers for Series, specifically mentioning the difference in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers.
4. The problem lies in how the `key` input is handled within the `_get_with` function, causing the KeyError when using a list as the key.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.
2. The conditional check for `not is_list_like(key)` is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when a list is passed as the key input.
3. This inconsistency results in a KeyError when trying to access a key not present in the Series index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The fix should involve ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
2. Modify the conditional checks to correctly identify the type of key input and handle it appropriately to avoid the KeyError.
3. Refactor the code to provide a unified behavior for all types of indexers, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label-based
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index if it is list-like

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The fixed version of the `_get_with` function now correctly handles different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. By ensuring consistent behavior for all indexers, the issue causing the KeyError is resolved. The modifications align with the goal of providing a unified approach, addressing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
