## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing. However, in the case of a list-like key, it fails to handle the case properly, causing a KeyError to be raised when trying to retrieve values that do not exist in the Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `test_getitem.py` checks the behavior when using different types of indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series. It expects consistent behavior across these types. The current buggy function fails to provide the expected behavior, resulting in a KeyError.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, causing confusion and unexpected errors for users. The issue suggests making all cases behave like the list case to ensure consistency.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys properly and provide consistent behavior across all key types for indexing.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is list-like and handle it appropriately to avoid raising a KeyError for non-existent values.
2. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers to match the expectations of users and prevent confusion.
3. Update the `_get_with` function to handle list keys by directly using `self.loc` for retrieval instead of going through unnecessary checks and conversions.
4. Make sure to respect the existing logic for other types of keys while fixing the issue.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly using `self.loc[key]`, which resolves the KeyError issue for non-existent values and provides consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
