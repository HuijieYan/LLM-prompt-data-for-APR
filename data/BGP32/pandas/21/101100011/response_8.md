## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs to index a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses a key input that is a Series object which is converted to a list-like object for indexing.
3. The bug occurs when using a list as a key input for indexing a Series object, resulting in a KeyError when the index is not found.
4. The current implementation of `_get_with` does not handle list-like objects properly and treats them differently from other array-like objects.
5. The bug is reported in a GitHub issue where there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like objects in the same way as other array-like objects for indexing a Series object.
2. Ensure that a list input for indexing behaves consistently with other array-like objects to avoid KeyError exceptions.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like objects the same way as other array-like inputs
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

## Changes Made:
1. Added checks for `np.ndarray` and `ExtensionArray` conditions along with the existing `list` condition to treat all array-like objects similarly.
2. Return `self.loc[key]` for array-like objects like `list`, `np.ndarray`, and `ExtensionArray` to handle indexing consistently without causing a KeyError issue.
3. This modification ensures that list-like objects are handled correctly when indexing a Series object and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
