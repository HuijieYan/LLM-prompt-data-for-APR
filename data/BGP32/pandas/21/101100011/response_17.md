## Analaysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when a key doesn't match any values in the index.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the key type is inferred and how the indexing is handled in the `_get_with` function.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the difference in the behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a key that doesn't match any values in the index is passed as a list indexer, it raises a KeyError incorrectly. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers when the key doesn't match any values in the index. This involves correctly inferring the key type and handling the indexing based on the type of key.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

The corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled uniformly, and the correct indexing is performed when the key doesn't match any values in the index. This should fix the inconsistency and make the function behave as expected, passing the failing test and addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
