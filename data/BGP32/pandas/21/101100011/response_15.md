## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is meant to handle indexing operations on a `Series` object. It contains logic to determine the type of the key used for indexing and performs different actions based on the type. The issue arises when a list-like object is used as the key for indexing.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the indexing operation when a key is provided that does not match any values in the `Series`. The test uses different types of containers (list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to construct the key. All these different key types should ideally yield the same behavior according to the test.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior when using a list as the key for indexing compared to other array-like key types. The issue also mentions that making all cases behave like the list case results in only one failing test, which was added in a previous update.

## Potential error locations in the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with` exhibits potentially incorrect behavior when handling list-like objects as keys for indexing. The specific part that causes the issue is the handling of the key type "list" within the function. The logic for determining the action to take based on the key type may need adjustments for list-like keys to match the expected behavior.

## Bug cause

The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior in handling list-like objects as keys for indexing in the `_get_with` function. When a list is provided as the key, the function does not handle it properly, leading to an error in the indexing operation. The inconsistency arises because other array-like key types are handled correctly, but lists are not.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys for indexing. The key type "list" should be treated in a similar manner to other array-like key types to maintain consistency in behavior. By adjusting the handling of list keys, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
        
        # Modify the condition to specifically handle list keys
        if isinstance(key, list):
            if not key:
                return self.iloc[[]]
            else:
                if not all(self.index.isin(key)):
                    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
                return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With the modification above, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys correctly and maintain consistency in behavior across different types of indexers.
