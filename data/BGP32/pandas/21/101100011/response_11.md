## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing keys, such as slices, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, Index objects, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series using a list-like object that doesn't match any values in the index. However, the behavior for different types of indexers is inconsistent, leading to a KeyError instead of returning NaN values.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when a list-like key is provided and none of the values in the key match the Series index. The function attempts to handle different cases of key types but fails to provide consistent behavior for list-like indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers exhibit consistent behavior with array-like indexers. We can adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys that do not match any values in the Series index.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
  
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not key.isin(self.index).any():
        return self._constructor(index=key, dtype=self.dtype)

    try:
        indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
        key_array = self.index.take(indexer)
        return self.reindex(key_array)
    except InvalidIndexError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [{type(self).__name__} index]")
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle list-like keys that do not have any matching values in the Series index by returning a new Series with the provided key values.

Once the function is updated with the corrections, the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass without raising a KeyError due to inconsistent behavior with list-like indexers.
