### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case for a list-like `key` properly. It is incorrectly assuming that a list-like `key` can be used directly for indexing, which leads to a KeyError when trying to retrieve data from the Series.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the Series when indexing with a list-like `key`, which currently fails due to the logic in the `_get_with` function.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) and the need for a consistent approach across all types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by modifying the handling of list-like `key` in the `_get_with` function. We need to ensure that a list-like `key` is correctly processed and used for indexing without causing a KeyError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like `key` for indexing in a Series, resolving the KeyError when using a list as an indexer. This change aligns with the expected behavior across different types of indexers and addresses the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
