## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is not handling the case where the key is a list properly. It is not checking if the list is empty before further processing. This issue is causing inconsistency in behavior when indexing with lists compared to other data types like np.array or pd.Index.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The buggy function is not properly handling the case when the key is a list.
2. It is assuming that the key is not empty without explicitly checking for that.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `_get_with` function is not checking for empty lists before further processing. When an empty list is passed as the key, the function does not handle this case correctly, resulting in an error when trying to reindex with an empty key.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to check if the key is an empty list at the beginning and return the appropriate result without further processing. This will ensure consistency in behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key) or len(key) == 0:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to check if the key is an empty list at the beginning, we can avoid the KeyError that was occurring due to this scenario. This correction ensures consistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
