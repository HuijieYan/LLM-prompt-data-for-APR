The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the logic used to handle different types of keys for indexing the Series object. The issue is with the `if not is_list_like(key)` condition, where the intent is to handle scalars that are not recognized as list-like objects. However, the condition is not correctly identifying such scalar objects, leading to an incorrect branch being taken in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the condition that checks for scalar key types and ensure that it correctly distinguishes them from other types of input.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for scalar key
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for scalar keys by including `int` and `np.int` objects in the condition `not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (int, np.integer))`. This ensures that scalars are correctly handled and prevents them from falling into the wrong branch of the code logic.
