The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when the input key is a list-like object and the function incorrectly assumes that it should be treated as a positional indexer. This causes issues when trying to access elements in the Series based on the key.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the key is a list-like object and handle it appropriately to avoid the error of misinterpreting it as a positional indexer.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check to handle list-like objects properly by using `self.loc[key]` instead of assuming it should be treated as a positional indexer. This ensures that the Series access based on the key is correct and avoids misinterpretation.
