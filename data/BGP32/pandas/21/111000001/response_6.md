The bug in the `_get_with` function comes from the logic for handling a list-like object as the key. The bug arises when determining the key type and handling it accordingly. If the key is list-like, the current implementation converts it to a list and then tries to infer the data type. This approach can lead to incorrect handling of keys that are not list-like but still iterable.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for handling list-like keys to handle both list-like and other iterable objects correctly. We will remove the conversion of the key to a list and directly handle iterable keys. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is list-like. If it is not, we directly use it as a key for locating values in the Series. This approach ensures that keys of any iterable type are handled correctly without unnecessary conversion to a list.
