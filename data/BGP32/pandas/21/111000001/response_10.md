The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the condition where the type of the `key` parameter is checked. The bug occurs when the `key` is a single value that is not recognized as list-like and not one of the supported types (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index). The function tries to access `self.loc[key]` assuming `key` is a valid index but encounters an error if it is a scalar that is not considered list-like.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition where the type of `key` is checked to handle scalars that are not list-like. We can update the condition to check if `key` is a scalar and not list-like, then explicitly convert it to a list before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case where `key` is a scalar and not list-like by converting it to a list before proceeding with further processing. This modification ensures that the function does not encounter errors when dealing with scalars as single keys.
