Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` might not be handling all cases correctly.
2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` might be missing some valid types.
3. The logic for deciding between positional and label-based indexing based on `key_type` might be incorrect.

Cause of the bug:
The bug lies in the inconsistency of handling different types of `key` values in the `_get_with` function. The function fails to correctly differentiate between different types of keys and decides whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove unnecessary type checks that might be causing issues.
2. Implement a more robust method of determining the indexing approach (positional or label-based).

Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Simplified the condition for handling various key types
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Check if key is an ExtensionArray
    if isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle integer and label-based indexing based on key_type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version is more concise and should handle various types of keys appropriately, improving the overall functionality of the `_get_with` function.
