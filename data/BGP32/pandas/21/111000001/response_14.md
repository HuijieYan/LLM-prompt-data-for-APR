The bug in the `_get_with` function is the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object. The function checks if `key` is not list-like and returns `self.loc[key]`, which would work for scalar values, but it incorrectly handles the case where `key` is a list.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list-like object, the function should return `self.loc[key]` to correctly handle the case where `key` is a list of values to be indexed on the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # fallback for scalar values
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `is_list_like(key)` to handle the case where `key` is a list-like object, and return `self.loc[key]` to correctly handle such cases. Other types of `key` are handled as before, with appropriate return statements.
