The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the condition where `if not is_list_like(key):` is checked. This condition tries to handle the case where the key is not list-like, and it needs to fall back on the `loc` operation. However, the implementation of this condition does not consider the case where `key` is a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition handling for scalars that are not recognized, and ensure that the `loc` operation is correctly executed for these cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated condition handling for scalars that are not recognized
    if not is_list_like(key) or not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the condition `if not is_list_like(key) or not is_scalar(key):` checks for cases where the `key` is not list-like or not a recognized scalar. By updating this condition handling, the function correctly falls back on the `loc` operation for scalars that are not recognized, fixing the bug in the original implementation.
