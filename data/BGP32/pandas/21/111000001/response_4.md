The buggy function `_get_with` in the Series class is intended to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, there is a bug in the code that causes an issue when trying to determine the type of key being used.

The bug lies in the following block of code:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```

The issue is that the condition `isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` is checking if `key` is an instance of any of the specified types, and if it is not, it converts `key` to a list. However, there are specific cases where `key` should remain unchanged (e.g., when it is an Index object).

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to check if `key` should be converted to a list. We should only convert `key` to a list if it is not already a list or a NumPy array. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):` checks if `key` is not already a list or a NumPy array before converting it to a list. This ensures that the key is not unnecessarily converted to a list when it shouldn't be.
