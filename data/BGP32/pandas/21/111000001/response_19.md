The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of keys are handled. The issue arises when handling a key that is neither a list-like object nor recognized as a scalar. In this case, the function attempts to access `self.loc[key]` which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic to handle non-list-like and non-scalar keys differently. One approach is to convert non-list-like keys into a list and then proceed with the appropriate logic based on the type of the key.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):  # Modified condition
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the check for non-list-like and non-scalar keys has been added, which converts the key into a list before proceeding with the logic. This ensures that the function handles all types of keys correctly and avoids unexpected behavior.
