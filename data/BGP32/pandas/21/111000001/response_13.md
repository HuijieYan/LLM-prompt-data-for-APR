The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when checking the type of `key` and attempting to handle different cases based on its type. The issue lies in the type checking and conversion logic.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the type checking and handling of different cases are done correctly according to the expected behavior of the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the type of `key`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid key type provided for indexing.")
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `key` is a slice and handle it accordingly. Then, we directly use `loc` to access the values if `key` belongs to specific types like `ABCDataFrame, list, tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index`. In case the type of `key` does not match any of these, we raise a `TypeError` to indicate that the key type provided for indexing is invalid.
