### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is meant to handle different types of indexers for a Series object, including slice, dataframe, tuple, and various other cases.
2. The issue arises due to inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers within the function.
3. The bug is related to determining the key type and then appropriately accessing the data based on that type. In the failing cases provided, the key type is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, leading to incorrect data retrieval.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the key type, especially for list-like indexers, and then access the data accordingly.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly identify the key type for list-like indexers and access the data based on the identified type.
2. Ensure that the function handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers to align with expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Correct type identification for list-like indexers
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly identified for list indexers and accesses the data accordingly, aligning with the expected behavior as described in the failing test cases.
