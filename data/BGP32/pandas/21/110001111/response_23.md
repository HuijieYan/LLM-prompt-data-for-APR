### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class has a buggy function `_get_with` that handles fetching values based on different types of keys.
2. The function encounters issues when dealing with different types of key inputs like `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and others.
3. The bug arises due to the inconsistency in how different types of keys are handled, especially involving lists and scalars, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, ensure that the function handles all types of keys uniformly, following a consistent approach.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` handles different types of keys inconsistently, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing values from the Series. The inconsistency arises when dealing with list-like keys compared to other types like slices or tuples. This inconsistency contradicts the expected behavior from the function, resulting in errors like `KeyError` when trying to access values using a list key.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the function `_get_with` to handle all types of keys in a consistent manner. Ensure that all key types (list, ndarray, Index, scalar) are processed uniformly to provide the expected output and address the issue raised in the GitHub report.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # ensure a common Index type for consistency
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the case of list-like keys uniformly
    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version ensures that all types of keys are processed consistently, especially list-like keys, to avoid the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and provide the expected behavior for fetching values from the Series.
