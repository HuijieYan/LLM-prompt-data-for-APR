### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input `key` values and performing operations accordingly. The issue arises when a list-like `key` is passed, leading to incorrect handling of the data.
2. The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of list-like `key` values within the function.
3. In the provided runtime values and types of variables, the `key_type` is consistently defaulted to `'string'`, which indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` input parameter.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles list-like `key` inputs to prevent the error.
5. The corrected version of the function is presented below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the additional check for list-like `key` inputs and properly handling them, this corrected version of the function should resolve the issue described and provide the expected behavior for different types of key inputs.
