### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function due to incorrect handling of the key types, specifically when the key is not list-like. The function attempts to locate the key in the Series using different methods depending on the type of the key. However, due to a flawed conditional logic, it fails to correctly identify non-list-like keys, resulting in errors and incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Revise the conditional checks to properly handle key types and determine the appropriate method for accessing the key in the Series.
2. Ensure that the key is processed correctly based on its type to avoid errors and inconsistencies.
3. Address the case where the key is not list-like to handle various key types consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made
1. Reorganized the key type checks to handle scalar values separately from list-like or array-like key types.
2. Added a check for scalar keys to directly use `self.loc[key]`.
3. Updated the check for different key types to correctly determine whether to use positional or label-based indexing.
4. Ensured consistent handling of non-list-like keys throughout the function.
