### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is designed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing. The function contains conditional statements based on the type of `key` to perform the appropriate indexing operation. The issue arises due to inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list. The GitHub issue highlights the discrepancy in how indexing with a list is treated differently from other types of input, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

### Error Location
The buggy behavior is occurring in the section where the function deals with the `key` input. Specifically, the conditional blocks related to handling list-like keys are causing the inconsistency.

### Bug Cause
The function is intended to handle various types of keys for indexing, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalar values, lists, and other array-like structures. However, the bug arises when handling list-like keys due to the inconsistent treatment compared to other key types. The function incorrectly handles the `key` when it is a list, leading to unexpected behavior and possibly raising errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that indexing with a list behaves consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements and the flow of the function to correctly handle list-like keys. By refining the logic in handling list keys, we can align the behavior with the expected functionality and resolve the reported issue.

### Correction to the Buggy Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the inconsistency and resolves the indexing issue with list-like keys:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        if len(key) == 1 and isinstance(key[0], str):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles list-like keys by distinguishing between single string keys and general reindexing, aligning the behavior with other types of indexers and resolving the reported inconsistency. It ensures that indexing with lists behaves consistently and matches the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
