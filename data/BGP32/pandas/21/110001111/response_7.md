### Analysis:
1. The `buggy function` `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` library is used for differentiating between the types of keys passed for indexing a Series object.
2. The bug seems to be occurring when a list-like key is encountered, resulting in an incorrect handling of the key and leading to a `TypeError`.
3. The bug causes misidentification of the key type, resulting in improper retrieval of the values from the series. This can be seen from the runtime values and types of variables before the function's return not aligning with the expected values.
4. To fix the bug, proper identification of the key type and handling of list-like keys need to be addressed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling list-like keys, resulting in incorrect key type identification.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly identified and processed within the `_get_with` function.

### Corrected Version:
The following corrected version of the `_get_with` function addresses the bug:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles list-like keys and ensures correct identification of the key type for proper indexing of the Series object.
