### Analyze the buggy function

The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys to retrieve values. The function encounters a bug where it fails to properly handle a key that is not list-like. This inconsistency leads to various issues depending on the type of the key provided.

### Potential error locations
1. Incorrect handling of key types in the if-elif checks.
2. Inadequate distinction between list-like and non-list-like keys.
3. Improper usage of `if` statements without considering all possible key types.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not handle non-list-like keys correctly. The function should be able to cater to keys that are not list-like such as a scalar or a different object type. The handling of non-list-like keys is inconsistent and results in KeyError or unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of non-list-like keys to ensure consistent behavior across different key types. We should provide a suitable fallback mechanism to cover all types of keys and avoid KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle non-list-like keys by reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a new check to handle non-list-like keys by reindexing. This change ensures that all types of keys are properly handled and prevents unexpected behavior or exceptions.
