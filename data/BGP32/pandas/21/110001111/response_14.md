### Analysis
1. The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` function, which handles different types of key inputs to retrieve values from the series.
2. The bug occurs when the key input is a non-array-like object such as a scalar that isn't recognized as a scalar by `lib.is_scalar`.
3. The function should return the value located at the key index but currently raises an error or doesn't handle non-array-like keys correctly.
4. The issue relates to inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers when accessing values from a series.

### Bug Explanation
The current implementation of the function `_get_with` doesn't properly handle non-array-like key inputs. The function tries to determine the type of the key but fails to check for non-list-like or non-array-like objects adequately. This leads to incorrect behavior and errors when trying to access values from the series using such keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the function to properly handle non-array-like keys by ensuring that the key type is validated correctly before attempting to access the values.
2. Adjust the code logic to handle different types of key inputs consistently to avoid errors and ensure correct data retrieval.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of non-array-like keys and improves the consistency of how different types of indexers are processed to access values from the series.
