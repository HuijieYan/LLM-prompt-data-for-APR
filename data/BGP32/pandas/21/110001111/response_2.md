### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is encountering issues with different types of input keys, leading to incorrect handling and potentially returning unexpected results. The cases provided indicate that the function is interpreting the key incorrectly and failing to return the expected output.

### Error:
- The key type is not being identified accurately, leading to incorrect branching in the conditional statements.
- The key types are not being handled consistently, causing unexpected behaviors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the misinterpretation of key types, especially in cases where the key is a list or Index object. The function fails to properly differentiate between integer, label-based, and other types of indexing, resulting in incorrect processing and returns.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure proper identification of key types to determine the correct indexing approach.
2. Handle different types of keys consistently to maintain predictable behavior across all cases.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to list for consistent processing
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list key case for consistency
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Added a check for scalar keys to handle cases like scalars not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.
2. Ensure conversion of different key types to a consistent list format for uniform processing.
3. Updated the conditional statement for integer keys to provide appropriate labeling or positional indexing based on the index.
4. Included a more consistent handling for list keys to avoid issues such as `KeyError`.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now handle various input key types more consistently and deliver expected outcomes across all scenarios.
