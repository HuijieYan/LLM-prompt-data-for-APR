### Analysis
1. The `Series` class has a method `_get_with` that handles different types of keys for indexing, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and others.
2. The bug occurs when dealing with lists as keys, causing an issue with the indexing behavior.
3. The bug leads to incorrect handling of list-like keys, resulting in unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like keys to ensure consistency in indexing behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` fails to properly handle list-like keys for indexing. This issue arises from the conditional checks for different types of keys. When a list-like key is encountered, the function applies incorrect logic, leading to unexpected results. The incorrect handling of list-like keys deviates from the desired indexing behavior and results in errors or incorrect outputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for list-like keys to ensure consistent and correct indexing behavior. By updating the conditional statements and the corresponding actions for list-like keys, we can address the issue and align the function's behavior with the expected indexing outcomes.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Ensure key is a list for consistent handling

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]  # Use label-based indexing
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]  # Use positional indexing

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the issue with list-like keys and ensure that the `_get_with` function behaves consistently and appropriately for different types of keys during indexing operations.
