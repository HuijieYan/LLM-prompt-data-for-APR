## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with different types of indexers. The issue arises from the conditional flow, specifically when checking the type of key and deciding how to handle it. The function fails to appropriately handle different types of indexers, leading to incorrect behavior.

The buggy function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, causing inconsistencies in behavior based on the type of the indexer. This issue is related to an existing GitHub issue that highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected errors or behavior in certain cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers, especially when the indexer is list-like. We can modify the conditional flow of the function to address the specific cases where the handling was incorrect, such as properly differentiating between list-like indexers and other types.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues with handling different types of indexers, specifically tackling the inconsistency related to list-like indexers. By properly differentiating and handling list-like indexers within the conditional flow, the function should now behave consistently across various indexer types.
