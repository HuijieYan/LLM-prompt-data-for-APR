### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function aims to handle different types of key provided for indexing in a Series object.
2. The key parameter can be a slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, Index, or other types, and based on its type, the function should return the corresponding values.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the indexing keys when they are provided as a list. The function currently does not handle list-like keys correctly in some scenarios, leading to faulty behavior during indexing.

### Error Location:
The bug is most likely in the section where the function handles list-like keys. The issue seems to arise from improperly handling list keys.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function does not properly differentiate between different types of keys, leading to incorrect processing.
2. When a list key is provided, the function does not handle it consistently, causing the unexpected behavior observed in the failing cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently and correctly according to the Series indexing rules.
2. Check and correct the logic for handling different types of keys to ensure appropriate behavior in all cases.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures consistent and correct handling of list-like keys in Series indexing. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
