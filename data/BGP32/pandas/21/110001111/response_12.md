### Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class has a bug when handling different types of key inputs, leading to unexpected behavior. The bug appears to be causing incorrect determination of the `key_type` which results in the function not returning the expected output. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in a `Series`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of the key when it's a list in comparison to other types like an ndarray or Index. This inconsistency leads to incorrect inference of the `key_type`, which affects the logic flow in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers aligns with other array-like indexers to maintain consistency. Specifically, the code needs to correctly determine the `key_type` and handle the key appropriately based on its type. This fix should align with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and address the issue raised on GitHub.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Determine the type of key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(np.array(key), skipna=False)

    # Handle based on key_type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by ensuring consistent handling of different types of key inputs and correctly inferring the `key_type` for appropriate processing. It aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test cases and should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistency in indexing behavior.
