### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, etc., by performing specific operations based on the types. However, it seems to mishandle the case when `key` is a list. This results in unexpected behavior and a failure to return the correct values.

The runtime values in the cases provided demonstrate that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` when it should be handling list-like keys properly. This mismatch causes the function to return incorrect results.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `if` statements within the function. The function is not properly processing list keys, leading to an incorrect determination of `key_type` and subsequent wrong branching logic.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly and that the `key_type` is determined accurately based on the input `key`. We should modify the logic within the function to properly identify list-like keys, avoid misclassification of their type, and ensure that the appropriate branch is taken based on the type of key provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys correctly
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are processed correctly, avoiding the misidentification of key types, leading to a more accurate branching logic within the function.
