### Bug Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class handles different types of input keys and performs operations based on their types.
2. The bug occurs when processing a key that is neither a slice, nor a DataFrame, nor a tuple, nor a scalar. In this case, the function wrongly tries to access `self.loc[key]`.
3. The issue is related to how indexers are handled differently in various scenarios, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a key that is not recognizable.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly process the input key and handle non-recognizable key types appropriately.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = list(key)

    if not self.index.is_unique:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that non-recognizable keys are appropriately handled, respecting the index uniqueness and type inference. It addresses the inconsistency in indexing behavior observed in the failing cases.
