### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in pandas. It is responsible for handling different indexers for the `Series` object.
2. The buggy function contains conditional blocks to handle different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects.
3. The bug seems to be related to differentiating between array-like indexers, specifically lists, resulting in unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer. The bug causes an incorrect determination of the `key_type`, leading to the wrong indexing method being selected, ultimately affecting the return value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper identification and handling of list indexers, matching them to the expected behavior established in the GitHub issue. We should correctly detect list-like indexers and handle them consistently with other indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the conditional blocks to correctly identify list-like indexers and handle them according to the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue. Ensure that a consistent approach is taken for different array-like indexers.
2. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` to appropriately recognize list indexers and choose the correct indexing method.
3. Maintain the integrity of the `key` variable and ensure that the return value aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This corrected version includes adjustments to properly handle list indexers along with other array-like indexers. It aims to resolve the inconsistent behavior and address the bug described in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
