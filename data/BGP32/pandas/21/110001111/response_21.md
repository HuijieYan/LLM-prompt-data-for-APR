### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, the problem seems to arise from how it treats certain key types, leading to incorrect results. The function is breaking the expected behavior when dealing with list-like key inputs, causing the test cases to fail.

### Error Location
The issue likely lies in the handling of list-like keys because it diverges from the expected behavior documented in the GitHub issue. Specifically, the case when `not is_list_like(key)` is triggered may be causing the problem.

### Bug Cause
Based on the provided details and the GitHub issue, it seems that the function `_get_with` should handle list-like keys similarly to array-like keys to maintain consistency. The function currently deviates from the expected behavior, leading to failures in test cases involving list-like keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, it is necessary to modify the logic related to list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. By ensuring that list-like keys are treated consistently with array-like keys, the function should behave as expected and pass the provided test cases.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
# Corrected _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version prioritizes the handling of list-like keys in a manner similar to array-like keys to align with the expected behavior discussed in the GitHub issue. By making this adjustment, the function should now correctly handle different key types and pass the provided test cases.
