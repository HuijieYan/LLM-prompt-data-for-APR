### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class contains the `buggy` function `_get_with`, which handles different types of keys for indexing a series.
2. The function checks the type of the key:
   - If `key` is a slice, it converts it to a positional slice and returns the sliced series.
   - If `key` is a DataFrame, it raises a `TypeError`.
   - If `key` is a tuple, it returns the values based on the tuple.
   - If `key` is not list-like, it tries to access the element using `loc`.
   - Further, it goes through different types like `Index`, `list`, etc., to decide how to access the values.
3. The bug arises when the key is a list, and it fails to handle the indexing properly, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. The expected behavior should align with how indexing is handled for arrays and indexes, ensuring consistency in handling different types of keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when `key` is a list due to inconsistent behavior in accessing the values compared to how arrays and indexes are handled. The incorrect identification of the key type leads to the flawed behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for handling keys as lists aligns with arrays and indexes. The key type identification and subsequent indexing should be modified to provide consistent and correct results across different types of keys.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert to Index to handle list-like keys consistently

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is converted to an `Index` type using `ensure_index` before further processing, ensuring consistent behavior for list-like keys. This modification aligns the handling of lists with arrays and indexes, resolving the bug.
