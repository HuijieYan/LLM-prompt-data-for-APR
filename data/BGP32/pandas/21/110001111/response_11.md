### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, NumPy arrays, Series, and Index objects. The bug seems to arise from the mishandling of different types of key input, specifically when the key is a list type.

In the GitHub issue, the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other indexers is highlighted. The bug is related to how `ser.loc[key]` behavior differs for list indexers as opposed to other types of indexers.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the key input is a list. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency causes an issue with `ser.loc[key]`.

Based on the provided runtime and expected values, it is clear that the function should correctly identify the key type as `'string'` and handle list indexers properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function appropriately handles list key indexers to align with the expected behavior for all types of indexers. The function should correctly determine the key type and process list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the condition to handle list indexers more explicit and ensuring that all list-like objects are processed consistently, the corrected function addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior for all types of key indexers.
