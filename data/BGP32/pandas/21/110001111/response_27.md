### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is not handling list-like indexers correctly, as reported in the GitHub issue.
2. The function incorrectly treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.
3. The function checks different conditions for various types of indexers, but the handling of list-like indexers is causing the issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from the function `_get_with` handling list-like indexers differently compared to other types of indexers. When a list indexer is encountered, it leads to incorrect behavior due to inconsistent handling, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. By treating list indexers the same way as other types of indexers, we can resolve the reported issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalar indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    # Treat all list-like indexers the same way
    key = list(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list indexers uniformly
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
With this correction, the function now handles list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
