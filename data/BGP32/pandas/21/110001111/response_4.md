### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of input `key`, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and various other data types, to extract values from the Series.
2. The issue arises when dealing with instances where the input `key` is not recognized as list-like, leading to an incorrect route being taken in the conditional statements.
3. Based on the failing test cases, the function is not handling the extraction of values correctly for certain types of keys, resulting in a wrong `key_type` classification.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the different types of input keys and ensure correct indexing or reindexing of the Series based on the key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional statements to handle each type of key appropriately.
2. Ensure that the key is correctly converted to a list-like object if necessary before further processing.
3. Check for key types, such as integer or boolean, to guide whether to use positional or label-based indexing.
4. Adjust the return statements based on the key types to return the values from the Series correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.is_integer():
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the case of list-like keys
    return self.reindex(list(key))
```

The corrected function now properly handles the various types of `key` inputs and ensures the appropriate extraction of values from the Series.
