The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different types of indexers such as list-like, ndarray, and Index. The issue arises when attempting to get values based on certain indexers leading to unexpected behavior. The bug causes incorrect inference of the `key_type` which results in a faulty decision on how to retrieve the values from the Series.

The following strategy can be employed to fix the bug:
1. Adjust the logic to properly handle different types of indexers such as list-like, ndarray, and Index.
2. Ensure that the correct type inference for the `key_type` variable is done to decide between positional or label-based indexing.
3. Refactor the conditional branches to properly return values based on the type of key provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer" and self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version properly handles different types of key inputs, infers the key type, and makes the decision on whether to use label-based or positional indexing accordingly. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
