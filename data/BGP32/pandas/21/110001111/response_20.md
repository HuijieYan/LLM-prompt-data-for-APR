## Bug Explanation
The issue arises from the way different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. In particular, when a list indexer is provided, it is not correctly validated, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexer types. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue where different indexers yield different results, with the list indexer causing a KeyError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including lists, are correctly validated and handled in a consistent manner. One approach would be to refine the logic in the function to properly identify and process list indexers to avoid the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub problem.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are properly handled and validated within the function, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
