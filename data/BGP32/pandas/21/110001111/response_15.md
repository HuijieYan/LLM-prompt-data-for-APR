### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of input `key` and perform the corresponding operations based on the type of `key`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of `key` when it is a list-like object.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing with a list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including lists, are handled consistently to avoid unexpected errors.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the inconsistent treatment of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list-like object, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to errors.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers. We should modify the logic to properly handle list indexers and prevent errors like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle key types other than list
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the handling of list-like indexers will be consistent with other types of indexers, fixing the bug and addressing the issue mentioned on GitHub.
