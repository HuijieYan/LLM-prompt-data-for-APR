### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class handles different types of `key` inputs to retrieve corresponding values.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of a `key` that is a list-like object and not being processed correctly.
3. From the runtime values and types of Case 1, 2, 3, and 4, the function fails to correctly identify the `key_type`, resulting in unexpected behavior.
4. The bug appears to stem from the logic surrounding the determination and handling of different `key` types within the function.
5. To fix the bug, revised logic for identifying `key_type` and processing the key appropriately needs to be implemented.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of input `key`.
2. Implement conditional statements to handle different types of `key` appropriately.
3. Ensure that the function can process list-like keys correctly and fetch values from the Series based on the key type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            return self.iloc[key]
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version revises the logic for handling different types of `key` inputs and correctly identifies the `key_type` to fetch values from the Series as expected.
