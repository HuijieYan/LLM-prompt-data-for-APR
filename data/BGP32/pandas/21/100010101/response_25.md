### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys to retrieve values from a Series. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the input key types, specifically when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

The failing test cases indicate that when a key of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series is passed to the function, the function is not handling these cases correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to access the Series with the key.

### Bug
The bug in the function is related to the incorrect handling of keys of type list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The function does not appropriately convert these key types into appropriate formats or handle them according to the expected behavior when accessing a Series.

### Fix Strategy
1. Check the type of `key` at the beginning of the function and handle different types accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function can handle keys of type list, ndarray, Index, and Series properly.
3. Return the correct values based on the key type.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = key.values

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function includes handling different types of `key` at the beginning of the function and appropriately converting keys of type list, ndarray, Index, and Series into values. It ensures that the key is in the correct format before accessing the Series data.
