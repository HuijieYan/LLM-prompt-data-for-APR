### Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys passed to a Series object for indexing.
- The function checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on the type.
- The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the key types, which leads to errors when indexing with certain types.
- The function should correctly determine the key type and take the appropriate action for each type of key.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs when the key passed to the Series for indexing is of type `list`, `np.array`, `Index`, or `Series`.
- The function tries to infer the dtype of the key, but in some cases, it incorrectly infers it as `'string'` instead of `'object'`.
- This incorrect inference leads to a mismatch in the key type expected in the reindex method of the Series, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the key type is correctly inferred and handled in the function.
- Specifically, we need to ensure that the inferred type is `'object'` for keys that are lists, arrays, Index, or Series, so that they can be correctly processed during indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        key_type = "object"  # Correct the inferred type to object

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary
- The bug in the function `_get_with` was caused by incorrectly inferring the type of the key as `'string'` instead of `'object'` for certain key types.
- By correcting the inferred type and ensuring that keys of types list, np.array, Index, and Series are handled correctly, the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
