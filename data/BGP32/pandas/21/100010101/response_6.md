### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` is incorrectly handling the input key when it is a Series object. Specifically, the function should treat `key` as a list-like object but is not doing so correctly, leading to errors when accessing the Series with a key that is a Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the input key is a Series object, it is correctly converted to a list before further processing. We can achieve this by updating the logic to properly handle Series objects as list-like objects.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Convert key to list if it's not already a list-like object
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles the case when the input key is a Series object by converting it to a list before further processing. This fix ensures that the function behaves correctly as expected in all cases.
