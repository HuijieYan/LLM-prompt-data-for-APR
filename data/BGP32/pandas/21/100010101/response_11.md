1. **Analyzing the buggy function:**
The function `_get_with` is intended to extract data from a Series based on the input key. The function checks the type of the key and returns the corresponding values from the Series accordingly.

2. **Identifying potential error locations:**
One potential error location is the behavior when the key is an `Index` object. The function seems to handle this case incorrectly based on the failing test cases. The issue could be due to not processing the key correctly when it's an `Index` object.

3. **Explanation of the bug:**
The failing test cases provide input key values in different formats like a list, numpy array, and pandas Index or Series objects. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling the key as expected. The output suggests that the function is not able to retrieve values corresponding to the keys provided in the test cases. This points to an issue with handling the key types such as Index, or Series objects.

4. **Strategy for fixing the bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles keys in all the test cases, especially when the key is of type `Index` or `Series`. It's crucial to correctly deduce the key type and treat it accordingly to extract the desired values from the Series.

5. **Corrected version of the function:**

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to correctly handle different key types, specifically ensuring that the key type is properly identified and corresponding values are extracted based on that type, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases.
