### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys and return the appropriate values based on the key's type. However, there are some issues in the implementation that lead to the failing test cases and the `KeyError` exception being raised.

1. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior.
2. There are multiple conditions checking for the type of the key, which can be simplified.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug arises from the key type not being correctly identified by the function, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to index the Series. In each failing scenario, the key is not being recognized and processed correctly by the function, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised.

The function should correctly identify the key type and handle it appropriately to return the expected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
1. Simplify the type checking logic to handle various key types more accurately.
2. Ensure that the key type is correctly identified before processing.
3. Update the return statements based on the identified key type.

### The Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check key type - List Like
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # Decide whether to use iloc or loc
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle list indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check key type - DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Check key type - Tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check key type - Other
    else:
        key = [key] if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # Decide whether to use iloc or loc
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle all other cases
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function now properly identifies the key type and handles each case accordingly. It should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected behavior for each input scenario.
