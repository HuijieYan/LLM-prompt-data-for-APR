### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` has a bug related to the handling of different types of `key` inputs, specifically for `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series` types. The function is incorrectly treating these inputs in various conditional statements, leading to errors when indexing a Series with these types. The bug is causing a `KeyError` to be raised during the test cases due to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the first conditional branch:
   - If `key` is like a list, it should be passed to `self.loc` for indexing. However, the bug is causing a `KeyError` when attempting to index with the `key` input.

2. In the second conditional branch:
   - If `key` is an `Index` object, it should extract the inferred type and proceed accordingly. The bug here is not correctly handling this scenario leading to an incorrect key indexing behavior.

3. In the last condition:
   - The function attempts to reindex the Series with the `key` input if it's not `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`. However, this behavior is not correctly implemented, leading to wrong indexing and finally raising a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles the different types of `key` inputs such as `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`. We should update the conditional branches to handle each type appropriately for indexing the Series without causing a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By addressing the conditional branches' handling for different types of `key` inputs, the corrected function should now correctly index the Series without causing a `KeyError`.
