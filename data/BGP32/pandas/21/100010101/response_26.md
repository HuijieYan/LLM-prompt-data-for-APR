### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there are some issues in the code:
1. The check for a key being an instance of `tuple` is missing, leading to potential issues when handling tuple keys.
2. The logic for checking the key type and then deciding whether to use `iloc` or `loc` is not handling all possible cases.
3. The handling of different key types is not consistent, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug
The bug arises because the function is not handling the case where the key is of type `Index` correctly. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access elements from the Series.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when the key is of type `Index` and ensure consistency in handling different key types.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handling key as a tuple
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling key as an Index
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Considering all possible key types
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        # Avoiding duplicates in indexing
        # NOTE: We assume here that the key should not be a list containing scalar types
        return self.loc[key]

    # Reindexing for other types of keys
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the correction above, the function should now properly handle different key types and avoid the `KeyError` seen in the failing test cases.
