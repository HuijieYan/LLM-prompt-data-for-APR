### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Pandas Series. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:
1. There are multiple conditions that check the type of the key input, but the conditions are not mutually exclusive.
2. Some conditions are redundant and can be simplified.
3. The key type inference logic is not working correctly.
4. The handling of different key types is inconsistent.

### Bug
The main bug in the function is the incorrect way the function infers the type of the key input. This leads to incorrect branching decisions and ultimately causes the function to fail when indexing a Series with specific types of keys.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly infers the type of the key input and then processes it accordingly. We should also simplify the logic by removing redundant conditions and making the type handling consistent across all cases.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

The corrected function simplifies the key type inference logic, ensures that the key is converted to a list if it is list-like, and then correctly processes the key based on its inferred type. This approach should fix the bug and pass all the failing test cases.
