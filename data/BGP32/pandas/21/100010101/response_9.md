### Analysis
The buggy function is `_get_with` which is used to retrieve values with a given key. The function includes multiple condition checks based on the type of the key. The bug is likely related to the handling of different key types.

### Issue
The bug occurs when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function tries to handle these cases differently based on the type of the key but does not handle them correctly, leading to a KeyError in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key.
2. Handle the cases where the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series appropriately.
3. Return the expected values based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function should handle the different key types correctly and should prevent the KeyError in the failing test cases.
