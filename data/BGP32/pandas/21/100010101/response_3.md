### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys in a Series object. However, the function fails to properly handle the case where the input `key` is an Index object. This results in a KeyError when trying to access elements in the Series.

#### Bug identified:
The bug is located in the conditional block where the type of `key` is checked. When `key` is an Index object, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

#### Bug explanation:
When the `key` is an Index object, the function fails to properly process it and ends up trying to access elements in the Series based on that Index object, causing a KeyError.

#### Bug fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case when `key` is an Index object. Instead of directly accessing values based on an Index object, we should convert it to a list first to access the elements correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary
The corrected function now properly handles the case when `key` is an Index object by converting it to a list before accessing elements in the Series. This should resolve the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test cases.
