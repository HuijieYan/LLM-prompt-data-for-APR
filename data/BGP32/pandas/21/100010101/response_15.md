### Issue in the buggy function:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the key type properly and is not returning the expected output based on the key type. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised in the failing test cases.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key being passed as an argument and handles each type appropriately to return the expected output.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the case where key is an Index like in the expected case 3
        # and get the inferred type from the key itself
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246 as in the expected case 4
    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected function now properly identifies the type of key being passed and handles each type according to the expected behavior. This should resolve the `KeyError` being raised in the failing test cases.
