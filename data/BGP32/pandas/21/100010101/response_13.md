### Code Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The function checks the type of the key and then takes different actions based on the key type.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles non-matching keys and/or when the key is not in the index.
4. The error messages indicate that the function is not correctly handling the key types provided during the failing tests.
5. The key types the function is expected to handle are: list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

### Bug and Fix Strategy:
1. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles keys of type list, ndarray, Index, and Series, preventing it from raising a KeyError when the key is not found in the Series.
2. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions and actions that handle different key types to ensure that a KeyError is raised when the key is not found.
3. Specifically, we need to ensure that the logic for handling non-matching keys or keys not in the index is correctly implemented for all key types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function to raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index for all key types, we ensure that the correct error is raised when the key does not match any index values. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and handle all key types as expected.
