The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrect handling of the key parameter when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series type. The function incorrectly assumes the key type based on certain conditions, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the Series object.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle different key types and ensure that the key is converted to the appropriate format for indexing. Specifically, we need to first check if the key is a list-like object, and if so, convert it to a list before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_list_like(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I've added a helper function `ensure_list_like` to properly handle converting key to a list-like object before further processing. This ensures that the key is compatible with the subsequent logic in the function.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle different types of keys and avoid the KeyError that was occurring in the failing test cases.
