### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys and perform the corresponding indexing operation on a Series object. However, there are several issues present in the function:
1. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'integer'` for cases where the key contains string values like 'C'.
2. The function does not correctly handle the case when `key` is a Series object.
3. The function does not handle the case when `key` is an Index object properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly infer the `key_type` based on the actual data type of the key.
2. Update the handling of different key types to align with the expected behavior.
3. Ensure proper handling when `key` is a Series or an Index object.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation
1. The correction includes inferring the `key_type` based on the data type of the key and handling different key types accordingly.
2. If `key` is a Series, it is converted to a list to ensure correct indexing operations.
3. When `key` is an Index object, the `key_type` is obtained from `key.inferred_type`.
4. Based on the `key_type`, appropriate indexing operations (`loc`, `iloc`, or `reindex`) are performed.
