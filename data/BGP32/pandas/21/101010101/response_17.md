### Bug analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when attempting to index a Series with an unexpected data type. The issue arises when the key is passed as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The code logic inside the function is not handling these data types correctly, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. We need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle the different data types that may be provided as keys.
2. Specifically, we need to ensure that the key is always converted to a list if it is not already one before performing any operations.
3. We also need to make sure that the code correctly handles different key types and acts appropriately based on the inferred data type of the key.

### Updated `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
        
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, MultiIndex):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated version of the `_get_with` function, the function should now correctly handle various input key types and avoid raising a KeyError in cases when unexpected data types are passed as keys. This fix should address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
