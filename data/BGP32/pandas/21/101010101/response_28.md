### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle certain key types properly, leading to a `KeyError` in the test cases.
2. Based on the error messages, the buggy function is not handling the key types such as lists, ndarrays, and Index objects correctly.
3. The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect type checking and handling of different types of keys in the function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all key types correctly and returns the expected outputs for each case.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to correctly handle various key types as described in the expected cases. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function properly determines the `key_type` based on the input key and then retrieves the desired values accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Index/Series/arrays is not supported, use appropriate indexing methods"
        )
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should now correctly handle different key types and provide the expected outputs for each case. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issues in the failing test cases.
