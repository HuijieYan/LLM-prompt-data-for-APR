### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. In the failing test cases, the key type passed to the function is not being correctly identified and processed. This leads to a KeyError during indexing.

The bug stems from the incorrect identification of the key type, specifically when handling different types of key inputs like lists, arrays, and indexes.

### Bug Identification
The bug occurs when the key type is incorrectly identified, leading to incorrect handling of the key for indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and processed for indexing. By properly determining the key type based on the input, we can select the appropriate indexing method (iloc or loc) to retrieve the values from the Series.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = key.dtype.type if hasattr(key, 'dtype') else type(key)

    if key_type == int:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    # Note: handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version:
- The key type is determined based on the input, taking into account scalars, arrays, and indexes.
- Proper handling of scalar key values using `is_scalar` function.
- Checking for the type of the key using `dtype.type` or `type(key)`.
- Ensuring that the key is converted to an Index if it is a list before reindexing.

This corrected version should now properly handle different types of keys for indexing the Series object and pass the failing test cases.
