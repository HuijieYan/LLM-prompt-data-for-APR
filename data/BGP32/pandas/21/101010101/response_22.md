### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of input keys, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index in a cascading conditional structure.
2. The bug occurs when the input key is an instance of Index, where the key type is not correctly inferred, leading to the incorrect branching of the logic in the function.
3. The error message in the failing test indicates that a KeyError is not being raised as expected.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the incorrect inference of the key type when the key is an instance of Index. This results in the wrong path being taken for further processing, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is properly inferred when the input key is an instance of Index, and then proceed with the appropriate logic based on the inferred key type.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function ensures that the key type is inferred correctly for all input cases, including when the key is an instance of Index, resolving the bug and enabling the function to handle different types of keys properly.
