### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue when dealing with `key` values that are not recognized as list-like but are scalar.
- The function is supposed to handle such cases by calling `self.loc[key]`, but the current implementation is incorrect.
- In the failing tests, the function should handle scalar values that are not recognized as list-like by treating them as single values to be located using `self.loc[key]`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function:
1. Check if the `key` is not list-like but a scalar.
2. If it's a scalar, directly return the result of `self.loc[key]`.
3. Update the function to correctly handle scalar values that are not recognized as list-like.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle other scalar cases that are not recognized as list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the given failing tests considering different types of input keys will pass successfully.
