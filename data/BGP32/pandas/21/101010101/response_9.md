### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function encounters an issue when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, resulting in a `KeyError` during the index retrieval process.

The bug arises from the check on the key type. It incorrectly treats the key as a single element in the `not is_list_like(key)` condition, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the key type when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function does not properly consider these types during the indexing process, leading to `KeyError` exceptions in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling keys that are lists, ndarrays, Index objects, or Series objects. We should ensure that the key is treated appropriately as a list-like object for correct indexing behavior.

### Correction: 

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key = self.index._convert_listlike_indexer(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like objects and converting all types of keys to list-like format using `_convert_listlike_indexer`, we ensure that the key is correctly processed for indexing. This correction should address the `KeyError` issues encountered in the failing test cases.
