The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key input when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function incorrectly attempts to infer the type of the key and determine how to index the Series based on that inferred type. This leads to the KeyErrors mentioned in the failing test cases.

The strategy to fix this bug is to simplify the handling of different types of keys by focusing on whether the key is list-like, and then proceed with indexing accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing Series")

```

This corrected version simplifies the logic by directly indexing using `self.loc[key]` if the key is list-like. Otherwise, it raises a TypeError for unsupported key types.

This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
