### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
- The failing tests are trying to index a Series with various types of keys, such as a list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
- The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, and the function tries to perform a location-based indexing using `self.loc[key]`.
- The bug results in a `KeyError` being raised instead of handling the different types of keys correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When the key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to use `self.loc[key]`.
2. This fails for certain types of keys, such as ndarray and Index, which results in a `KeyError` being raised.
3. The buggy function is not properly handling these cases and lacks proper type checking and handling logic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to properly handle different types of keys for indexing.
2. Implement type checking to handle keys that are not list-like objects correctly.
3. Resolve the issue with ndarray and Index key types not being recognized and processed properly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ABCSeries, ExtensionArray)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        elif all(isinstance(k, (int, np.int32, np.int64)) for k in key):
            key_type = "integer"
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function with the corrected version provided above, the buggy behavior should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass as expected.
