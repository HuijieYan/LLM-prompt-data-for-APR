### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is intended to handle different types of keys and return the appropriate value. 
2. The failing tests are due to a key error, which indicates that the function is not correctly handling the provided keys.
3. The buggy function is trying to determine the type of the key passed and select the retrieval mechanism based on the type.
4. The bug may be caused by incorrect detection or handling of the key type, leading to unexpected behavior.
5. We'll need to adjust the key type detection logic and the subsequent retrieval mechanism to correctly handle the keys in various formats.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the key type detection logic correctly identifies the type of key passed.
2. Adjust the retrieval mechanism based on the type of key to handle the keys as expected.
3. Update the function to return the appropriate value based on the key type to resolve the key error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column in the key"
        )
    
    # The bug may be caused by incorrect key type detection logic, let's update the key type identification
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Handling list-like keys correctly
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    else:
        # Handling scalar keys not recognized by lib.is_scalar
        key = [key] 
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to use positional indexer or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function aims to correctly identify the type of the key and provide the appropriate retrieval mechanism based on that type to address the key error in the failing tests.
