### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is incorrectly handling the input key when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series type. The function is expecting the input key to be processed as a string, but the actual input can be of different types such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

The bug causes the function to wrongly process the key_type, leading to incorrect behavior and raising a `KeyError` when trying to access elements that do not exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle different types of input keys correctly. By checking the type of the input key before processing it, the function can adapt its behavior accordingly. The key should be converted to a list in case of types like ndarray, Index, or Series to ensure proper indexing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list to handle different input types
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the function as described above, it should now be able to handle different input key types correctly and pass the failing test cases.
