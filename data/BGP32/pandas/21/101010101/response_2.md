### Proposed Fix

The bug seems to be related to the handling of key types in the `_get_with` function. The current implementation does not properly handle certain key types, leading to a failure in the test cases. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the key type handling logic to correctly identify the type of the key and branch accordingly. Based on the test cases and the expected values, it seems that the issue lies in determining the key type, which is essential for selecting the correct indexing method (`iloc` vs. `loc`). 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check if the key is a slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Check if the key is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Check if the key is a tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is not list-like
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list if necessary
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Infer the key type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle cases where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Fallback to reindex if key does not match above cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the type checking logic and correcting the branching based on the key type, the corrected function should now handle the various types of keys and pass the failing test cases.
