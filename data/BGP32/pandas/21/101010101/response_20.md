### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the various types of `key` inputs correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` during the tests. The function is intended to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, single values, lists, etc., and return the appropriate values based on the key type.

The bug occurs when the function tries to handle lists, ndarrays, Index, or Series as keys. The current implementation does not properly differentiate between these key types and does not return the expected values.

### Bug Explanation
When the input `key` is of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the function incorrectly converts the key to a list and then attempts to infer the key type using the `infer_dtype` function. This leads to incorrect handling of keys of these types and results in a `KeyError` during the test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Correctly differentiate between the different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and handle each case appropriately.
2. Do not convert the key to a list if it is already an Index.
3. Ensure that the key type is correctly inferred for different key types to determine the proper action (loc or iloc) to take.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            key_type = 'object'  # fixed to handle Series correctly
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(isinstance(k, (int, np.integer)) for k in key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes outlined in the corrected function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing test cases and meet the expected input/output values.
