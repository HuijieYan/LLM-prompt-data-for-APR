### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to get items from the Series using a key that is not present in the index.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the key is processed and checked for its type before performing the indexing operation.
4. The function should handle different key types appropriately and return the expected values based on the input key type.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is unable to handle the key type correctly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to get items from the Series using that key.

### Fix:
We need to ensure that the function properly identifies the type of the key and performs the indexing operation accordingly. Additionally, handling the case where the key does not match any index value is crucial to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == "string" or key_type == "mixed-integer-float":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected function, we properly handle different key types and perform the indexing operations based on the identified key type. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring during the tests.
