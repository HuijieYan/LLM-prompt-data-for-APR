### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of input keys when indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, leading to incorrect handling and causing an error in the test cases that pass different types of input keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to the indexing operation. The key error message indicates that the key being used is not found in the index of the Series.

### Bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of keys that are not list-like in the `_get_with` function.

### Fix Strategy:
- Check if the key is list-like, and if not, ensure that it's a valid type that can be used for indexing.
- Correctly handle different types of input keys to ensure that the indexing operation works correctly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (bool, int, float, str)):
        idx = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(idx)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle all types of keys and pass the failing test cases.
