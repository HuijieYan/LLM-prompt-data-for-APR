### Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is trying to handle different types of keys to return values.
- The test function is trying to get an item from a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series' index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
- The key is expected to be of type `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.
- The error message indicates that the test failed because the `KeyError` was not raised as expected.

### Bug Cause
- The bug is caused by the conditional checks for handling different types of keys within the `_get_with` function. 
- The function does not correctly handle the case when a key is a `list`, `np.ndarray`, or `pd.Index`, which results in the KeyError not being raised as expected in the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the function to handle `list`, `np.ndarray`, and `pd.Index` keys correctly and ensure that the correct type of key is being used for indexing.
2. Ensure that a KeyError is raised when the key does not exist in the Series' index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle different types of keys in a more robust way
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle lists, numpy arrays, and pd.Index keys appropriately
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self._get_values(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying these corrections, the function should handle different key types correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the Series' index.
