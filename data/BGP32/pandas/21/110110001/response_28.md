The bug in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class arises due to mishandling different types of keys, specifically failing to handle non-list-like or non-Index keys correctly.

The buggy function `_get_with` checks the type of the `key` parameter and then tries to retrieve the corresponding values from the Series. However, it does not correctly process `key` when it is not a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index type.

To fix the bug:
1. We should ensure that the function can handle a broader range of key types that are not explicitly checked.
2. We should accommodate for cases where `key` is not any of the expected types by correctly performing the operation according to the key type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for more types
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list to handle them uniformly

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decision based on positional vs. label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated function, the issues with handling various key types should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test cases.
