### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` module.
2. The function contains a conditional logic to handle different types of keys that is causing the bug.
3. The failing test is trying to test the behavior when a key that does not match any values in the Series is used to index it.
4. The bug occurs due to an incorrect check for the key type, resulting in an undesired behavior when the key is not found in the Series.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to account for the case when the key is not found in the Series and raise a `KeyError` as expected.

### Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(isinstance(key, obj_type) for obj_type in [list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index]):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class will correctly handle the case when the key does not match any values in the Series and raise a `KeyError` as expected. This fix ensures that the function behaves as intended and the failing test will pass.
