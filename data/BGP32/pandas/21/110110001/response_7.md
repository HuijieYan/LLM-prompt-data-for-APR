### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle indexing for a Series object.
2. The failing test is trying to index a Series object with a key that does not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The error occurs when passing a Series object as the key, and the buggy function fails to raise a `KeyError`.
4. The cause of the bug lies in the handling of the key input when it is a Series.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a Series, a `KeyError` is raised if any element of that Series is not found in the index of the main Series object.
6. We will update the function to correctly handle the case where the key is a Series.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):  # Updated this line
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, when a key of type Series is passed, the function will raise a `KeyError` if any element of the Series key is not found in the index of the main Series object. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave correctly according to the test case.
