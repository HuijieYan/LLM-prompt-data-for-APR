## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class and is responsible for handling various types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type. The error message from the failing test indicates that a `KeyError` is not raised when it's expected to be raised.

## Bugs
1. The function does not appropriately handle the case where the key is a `list` or an `ndarray`.
2. The function incorrectly treats the key as an index if it is an instance of `Index`, leading to incorrect indexing operation.
3. The function does not raise a `KeyError` when the specified key is not found in the Series index.

## Bug Fixes
1. For `list` or `ndarray` keys, the function needs to pass the key to `reindex` instead of just calling `loc` on the key.
2. If the key is an instance of `Index`, we should not infer a key type or perform any additional checks. The key should be used as is for indexing.
3. If the key is not found in the Series index, the function should raise a `KeyError`.

Let's make these corrections in the function `_get_with`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif np.isscalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
    
    # If key is a list or ndarray, reindex with the key
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # If key is an instance of Index, use it directly for indexing
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By making the modifications highlighted above, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the different types of keys and raise a `KeyError` when necessary.
