### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with()` is trying to handle different types of inputs like slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The error is likely to occur when `key` is not a list-like object and is neither a certain specific supported type like scalar, array, Series, etc.
3. The failing test is generating a KeyError when trying to access an element that is not present in the Series. This indicates that the bug might be related to how the function is handling non-list-like keys.
4. The current implementation of `_get_with()` does not cover all the cases properly and can lead to an exception when dealing with certain input types.
5. The bug can be fixed by properly handling all types of input keys and providing the correct response based on the input type.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handling non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handling different types of keys
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handling lists
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By correctly handling different types of keys and adding appropriate checks, this corrected version of the `_get_with()` function should now pass the failing test.
