The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` within the `Series` class has a bug related to the handling of different key types.

The main issue is that when the `key` is an instance of an `Index` class, the condition in the buggy function is comparing it incorrectly. It should check for `(key_type == "integer")` instead of `(isinstance(key, Index))`.

This incorrect comparison leads to the function not correctly identifying the type of key being passed and the subsequent incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition related to the `key` type check in the function. The correct condition should involve comparing the `key_type` variable that was computed based on the `key` that was passed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with(self, key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue and allow the function to work correctly with different types of keys, fixing the test failures where the function was being invoked with an incorrect key type.
