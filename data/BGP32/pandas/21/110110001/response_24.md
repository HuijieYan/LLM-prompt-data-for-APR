### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with()` within the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys passed to access elements within the `Series`.
2. The function contains conditional statements to determine the type of key and then process it accordingly. The bug may be present in how it handles certain types of keys.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to access a key (`key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)`) that is not in the index of the `Series`, leading to a `KeyError`.
4. The bug could be related to how the function processes non-list-like keys in certain situations, leading to the `KeyError`.
5. The bug may be fixed by ensuring that the function correctly handles non-list-like keys and reindexes them appropriately.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the logic for handling non-list-like keys so that they are correctly reindexed. Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type in ["boolean", "object"]:
        key = np.array(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.to_numpy()
    
    if not all(is_integer(i) or is_object_dtype(i) for i in key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles various types of keys correctly and reindexes them appropriately based on their type. It should resolve the `KeyError` issue raised by the failing test.
