The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the case when key is an array-like input such as a list, numpy array, Index, or a Series properly. The function attempts to treat such inputs as Index objects or force them to be converted into a list, which leads to errors in some cases.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle array-like inputs correctly. We should check if the key is an instance of list, numpy array, Index, or Series, and use appropriate indexing methods based on the type of the key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        try:
            key_idx = self.index.get_indexer(key)
            return self._get_values(key_idx)
        except InvalidIndexError:
            raise KeyError(
                f"None of {key} are in the [{self.index}]"
            )

    raise TypeError(f"Unsupported type '{type(key).__name__}' for indexing")
```

With this fix, the function should now correctly handle array-like inputs like lists, numpy arrays, Index, and Series, and the failing test should pass.
