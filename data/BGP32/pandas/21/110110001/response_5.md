### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method within the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function checks the type of `key` and then performs different actions based on its type. It seems to be trying to slice the Series based on the key provided.
3. The failing test is checking that an expected `KeyError` is raised when trying to access an element in the Series that does not exist.
4. The bug seems to be in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block where it tries to access the element with key directly using `.loc`, causing the KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the code arises from directly trying to access the element with a key by using `.loc[key]`. This approach fails when the key doesn't exist in the Series index, causing a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
Instead of directly using `.loc[key]` to access the element with a key that may not exist, consider reindexing the Series with the given key to handle the KeyError situation more gracefully.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version handles the case where the provided key does not exist in the Series index by reindexing the Series with the key and raising a KeyError if none of the keys are found in the index.
