### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists of different types, and perform specific actions based on the key type.
2. The failing test is checking for behavior when indexing a Series with a key that does not match any index values.
3. The failing test produces a `KeyError` which means that the `_get_with` function is not handling the key appropriately and raising an error when the key doesn't exist in the index.
4. Fixing the bug involves modifying the key handling logic in `_get_with` to correctly identify the key type and respond accordingly. Specifically, in this case, the issue seems to be with handling non-matching keys.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{repr(key)} not in index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"{repr(key)} not in index")
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except IndexError:
                raise IndexError(f"{repr(key)} not in index")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{repr(key)} not in index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding appropriate try-except blocks for handling `KeyError` and `IndexError` for the possible keys that might not exist in the index, the corrected function should be able to handle those cases without failing the test.

Now, running the failing test should pass with the corrected `_get_with` function.
