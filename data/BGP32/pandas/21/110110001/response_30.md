### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue in the condition block where it checks if the `key` argument is a list. The current implementation will not correctly handle scalar values or objects that are not recognized as iterable types. This could lead to unexpected behavior when indexing a Series.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the following part of the function:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the `elif` condition which assumes that if `key` is not list-like, it should be treated as a scalar and accessed using `.loc`. However, this assumes that the key is a single item and does not handle other types of non-list_like objects properly.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that scalars and non-iterable objects are correctly handled by the function, possibly using direct indexing if the key is a scalar. We should also consider modifying the type-checking condition to handle potential non-list_like objects correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By improving the handling of non-list_like and scalar values in the `_get_with` function, we can ensure that indexing using non-iterable keys is handled correctly. This should address the bug and make the function more robust against unexpected input types.
