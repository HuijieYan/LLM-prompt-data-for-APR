## Analysis
The `test_getitem_no_matches` test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access a key that does not exist in the series. However, the `_get_with` method in the `Series` class does not handle the case when the key is a `pd.Series` object. This leads to the test failing with a `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>` error.

## Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_get_with` method where it does not handle the case when the key is a `pd.Series` object. It only handles cases for `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and non-list-like objects.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the case when the key is a `pd.Series` object, which is a valid key lookup in a Pandas Series. When an unsupported key type is passed (a `pd.Series` object), it does not raise an error or handle it gracefully, causing the key lookup to fail and not raise the expected `KeyError`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should add another `elif` condition to check if the key is a `pd.Series` object. We can then raise a `TypeError` to indicate that indexing a Series with another Series is not supported.

## Buggy Function (Fixed Version)
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with another Series is not supported"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying the fix above, the test `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass successfully without any errors.
