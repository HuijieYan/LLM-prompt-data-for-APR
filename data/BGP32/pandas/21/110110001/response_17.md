### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from the `pandas` library is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series object.
- The bug seems to occur when a list, numpy array, Index, or Series object is passed as the key to index a Series, as seen in the failing test.
- The function incorrectly checks if the key is an instance of `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`, and tries to handle them differently. However, this logic is flawed and leads to the bug.
- The failing test tries to index a Series object with another Series object using `[...]` notation, and expects a `KeyError`, but it does not raise the expected error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function.
- The `isinstance(key, list)` check incorrectly leads to processing where it should follow the behavior for an Index-like object.

### Fix Strategy:
- Since the bug occurs when trying to index a Series object with a key that is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series object, we need to ensure that the key is handled appropriately regardless of its exact type.
- Instead of checking for specific types, we can utilize the behavior of the `loc` indexer to handle different types of keys uniformly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.loc[key]
``` 

### Changes Made:
- Removed the checks for specific types of keys.
- Always using the `loc` indexer to handle the key, ensuring consistent behavior.
- This corrected version should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
