### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys passed to a Series object.
2. The bug arises when trying to index the Series with a key that is not present in the index.
3. The failing test is checking if an error is raised when the key is not present in the index, specifically for different types of keys.
4. The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised when expected, which suggests that the function is not handling the key appropriately.
5. The bug occurs when handling a key that is not list-like and is not recognized as a scalar.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that when a key is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar, the function should raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Index is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Series index"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for scalar or non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key) and not lib.is_scalar(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # Handle positional indexing vs label-based indexing
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking for unrecognized scalar-like keys and raising a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index, this corrected function should pass the failing test case and handle key errors more appropriately.
