### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class has a bug in handling the `key` parameter.
2. The function is trying to handle different types of keys like slices, dataframes, tuples, etc., but there is an issue with the logic used for handling non-list-like keys.
3. The failing test is checking for the correct raise of a KeyError when trying to access a key that is not present in the index. However, the buggy function implementation does not handle this scenario correctly. 
4. The bug is related to the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys, leading to a KeyError not being raised in the specific test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the function handles non-list-like keys properly.
2. The function should raise a KeyError when the key is not present in the index.
3. Update the logic to handle different types of keys correctly to prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return np.array([self[key]])

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now handles non-list-like keys correctly and ensures that a KeyError is raised when a key is not present in the index. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected when tested with the failing test case.
