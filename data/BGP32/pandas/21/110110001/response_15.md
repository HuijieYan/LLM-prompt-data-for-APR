The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing a pandas Series. However, the bug is occurring when a `Series` object is passed as the key, which is not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because when an instance of the `Series` class is passed as the key, the function should catch and handle it properly, but it is reaching the last `return self.reindex(key)` statement instead, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug:
1. When a `Series` object is passed as the key, it should be converted to a valid key based on its values.
2. Since a `Series` is iterable, it should be checked earlier in the conditional statements.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is a pandas Series instance
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.values

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix ensures that if a `Series` instance is passed as the key, it extracts the values from the series and then proceeds with the appropriate indexing operation.
