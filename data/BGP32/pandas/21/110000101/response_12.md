### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect check for the type of `key` parameter. The current implementation checks if `key` is an instance of various types like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc., but it fails to correctly handle the case when `key` is a scalar value or in a different format. This results in an incorrect handling of the key and subsequently leads to unexpected behavior.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of `key`. Specifically, we should handle the case when `key` is not list-like or falls into any of the existing checks. We also need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred before proceeding with the indexing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function now correctly handles the case when `key` is not a slice, DataFrame, or another specific type. It infers the type of the key and decides whether to use label-based or positional indexing accordingly. It provides a more robust and accurate handling of different types of keys.
