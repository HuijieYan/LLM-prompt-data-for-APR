### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. It checks the type of the key and then performs different actions based on the key type. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of different key types.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like object and is not an instance of Index or other allowed types. This leads to the function trying to convert the key to a list, which can result in unexpected behavior when dealing with non-standard key types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should handle cases where the key is not recognized as list-like or an instance of allowed types properly. We can directly use the key for indexing if it's not list-like or an instance of Index. This will prevent unnecessary conversion to a list and ensure correct indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles cases where the key is not recognized as list-like or an instance of Index by directly using the key for indexing if needed, avoiding unnecessary conversions.
