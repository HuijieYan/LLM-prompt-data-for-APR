## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The issue arises when checking the type of the `key` parameter and deciding whether to treat it as positional or label-based indexing. In the buggy function, the check for `isinstance(key, Index)` is incorrect because even when `key` is an instance of `Index`, it proceeds to infer the type of `key` using `lib.infer_dtype`, which leads to the `key_type` being incorrectly set. This can cause unexpected behavior when deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing resulting in incorrect indexing or an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the type checking logic for the `key` parameter. We should first check if `key` is an instance of `Index` and handle it separately before inferring its type. This will ensure that the correct decision is made based on the actual type of `key`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the inferred type is used accurately to determine the indexing strategy.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        # Corrected logic to handle Index type separately
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        # For other types besides Index, use the inferred type
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have separated the handling of `key` when it is an instance of `Index` and when it is not. This ensures that the correct type is used for determining the indexing strategy, addressing the bug in the original function.
