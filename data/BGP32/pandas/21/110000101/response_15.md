## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The issue arises when determining the type of the `key` parameter. The function is not handling the case where the key is a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the value at the scalar key. 

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the code to properly handle scalar keys that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. We can directly access the value at the scalar key using `self.loc[key]` without performing additional type checks.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handling scalar keys without additional checks
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version directly returns the value at the scalar key without performing unnecessary type checks, resolving the bug and making the function more robust.
