### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` expects a key to be provided for indexing a Series. It checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on the key's type. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. The function is not correctly handling all possible input types and conditions.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. In the buggy function, the key type is incorrectly inferred in some scenarios, leading to the function not returning the expected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of `key`. This can be achieved by updating the logic for determining the `key_type` in a way that covers all possible input scenarios and accurately reflects the type of the key.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function updates the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key`. It also ensures that the `key` is converted to a list if it is not list-like or an ndarray. This should address the bug and satisfy all the expected input/output scenarios.
