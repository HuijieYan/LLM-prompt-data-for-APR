### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is meant to handle different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when using an index key that does not match any values in the Series.
3. The error is occurring when using a list indexer, where it raises a `KeyError` indicating that none of the values in the index match the provided key.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior for different types of indexers and suggests making all cases behave like the list case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. The function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a `KeyError` when the key does not match any values in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function to align it with the behavior of other types of indexers. This should involve checking if the key values are in the index and raising a `KeyError` if they are not found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    key_in_series = np.in1d(key, self.index)
    if not key_in_series.all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function explicitly checks if all the values in the key are present in the Series index using `np.in1d`. If any value is not found, a `KeyError` is raised indicating that none of the provided key values are present in the index. This aligns the behavior with the expectations of the failing test and the GitHub issue.
