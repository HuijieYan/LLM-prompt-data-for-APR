### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is invoked when indexing a `Series` object.
- The bug occurs when indexing with a list-like indexer, such as a list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. The expected behavior should be consistent regardless of the type of indexer used.
- The bug is identified in the snippet where it checks for `not is_list_like(key)`, which should handle scalars that aren't recognized as scalars.
- The failing tests are focused on the inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers and suggests aligning the behavior to be consistent.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.
- Specifically, the check `not is_list_like(key)` leads to unexpected behavior when indexing with list-like objects.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug and align the behavior across different types of indexers, we can remove the check `not is_list_like(key)` and directly handle all types of indexers uniformly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By removing the problematic `not is_list_like(key)` check, we ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
