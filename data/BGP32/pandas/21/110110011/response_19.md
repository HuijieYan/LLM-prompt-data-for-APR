### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
    - The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
    - It is used to handle different types of indexing key inputs and perform the appropriate actions based on the input type.
  
2. **Potential Error Locations in the Buggy Function**:
    - The issue could arise due to incorrect handling of key types within the function.
    - Different types of input keys are checked and processed with various paths of execution.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
    - The bug occurs when indexing with an array-like key, such as a list of values.
    - The error message indicates that when indexing with a list key (`ser[list(key)]`), a KeyError is raised, indicating that none of the elements in the list are in the index.
    - This behavior is inconsistent with indexing using other types of keys like arrays, series, or indexes.
    - The root cause seems to be related to how list-like keys are handled within the `_get_with` function.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
    - Ensure consistent behavior for indexing with different array-like keys.
    - Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys correctly and align with similar behaviors for other key types.
    
5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys correctly
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
   
This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the issue of inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like keys and ensure that the function works correctly for all types of array-like keys.
