### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing a `Series` object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access a `Series` index using a list-like object and expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised, which aligns with the GitHub issue mentioning the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.
4. The bug seems to be related to different types of indexers like list, array, or Series not being handled consistently within the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like objects (like lists, NumPy arrays, Index objects, or Series objects) correctly. When a list-like object is provided as an indexer, the function should raise a KeyError if none of the elements in the list are found in the index of the Series. However, the current implementation does not raise the KeyError when a Series object is used as an indexer.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like objects as indexers and raises a KeyError when necessary. We can modify the code to explicitly check for list-like objects and perform the necessary operations to match the expected behavior according to the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            if not any(idx in self.index for idx in key):
                raise KeyError(
                    f"None of {key} are in the {self._index}"
                )
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking for list-like objects and raising a KeyError if none of the elements are found in the index, we ensure the function behaves consistently across different types of indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
