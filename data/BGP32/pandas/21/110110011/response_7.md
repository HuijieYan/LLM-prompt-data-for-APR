### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module is intended to handle different types of indexers such as slices, data frames, tuples, and more.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file uses different types of indexers like list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series to access values from a Series object.
3. The failing test asserts that when accessing values using a list indexer, a `KeyError` exception should be raised, but currently, it is not raising the exception as expected due to a bug in the `_get_with` function.
4. The root cause of the bug is in how different indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function, particularly when the key is list-like.
5. The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights inconsistencies in how list-like indexers are handled as compared to other indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Since the failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised for list-like indexers, the bug fix should ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers.
2. The code needs to be updated within the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like key parameters and raise a `KeyError` when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
            
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic within the `_get_with` function to appropriately handle list-like indexers and raise a `KeyError` when needed, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
