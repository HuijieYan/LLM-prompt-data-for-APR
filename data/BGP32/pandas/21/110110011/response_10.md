### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in pandas, used for indexing. It handles different types of keys including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various other types.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior when indexing with a key that has no matches in the series.
- The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected when indexing with a list-like key.
- The GitHub issue #5880 raises a concern about the inconsistent behavior of indexing with list-like keys compared to array-like keys, specifically mentioning that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases except when indexing with a list.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug stems from the conditional statements in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block. This block tries to handle cases where the key is not list-like by attempting to index with `.loc[key]`. However, this approach does not raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index when using a list-like key.
- The `is_list_like` function is incorrectly identifying a list-like key, and the subsequent handling of the key is not consistent with the desired behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the condition for identifying list-like keys to ensure that list keys are properly handled.
- Adjust the logic within the block to appropriately raise a KeyError when the key is not in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check for list-like keys and appropriate handling
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index.__name__}")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like keys by raising a KeyError when the key is not present in the index, aligning with the desired behavior.
- By updating the identification and handling of list-like keys, the bug is fixed in accordance with the bug report on GitHub.
