## Analysis:
- The `get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of key indexing, but it fails to properly handle a list-like key indexing.
- The failing test is testing the behavior when using a list-like key that does not match any index values, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
- The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected when using a list-like key that does not match any index values.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically the discrepancy in error handling when using a list-like key.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not properly handle the case when a list-like key is passed to it, leading to incorrect behavior and failure to raise a `KeyError` when an index value is not found.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles list-like keys in a way that aligns with the expectations set by the failing test and addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue. Specifically, we need to ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when a list-like key does not match any index values.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # Converting to a list if not already in order to check for the key existence in the index
        key = list(key)
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks if all elements in the list-like key exist in the index and raises a `KeyError` if any of them are not found. This aligns the behavior with the expectations of the failing test and addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
