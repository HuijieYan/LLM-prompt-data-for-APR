### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values from the Series data.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is meant to check the behavior of indexers when they don't match any values in the Series.
- The error message indicates that the test didn't raise a `KeyError`, which implies that the function is not handling the 'list' type indexers properly.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, especially when there are no matches.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the function not correctly handling 'list' indexers when there are no matches in the Series data.
- The specific condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` which is meant to handle scalars not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` is incorrect and interferes with the 'list' type indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` to handle the 'list' type indexers correctly.
- To resolve the bug, we should ensure that 'list' indexers are treated consistently and raise `KeyError` when there are no matches.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to list for consistent handling

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of non-list-like keys and ensuring that 'list' indexers are consistently treated by converting them to a list, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the failing test and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
