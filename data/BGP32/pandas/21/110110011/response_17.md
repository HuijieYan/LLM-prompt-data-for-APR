### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the Pandas library.
- The function is used for indexing and retrieving values from a `Series` object based on the `key`.
- The failed test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of indexing for different types of `key` inputs.
- The error message indicates that the test did not raise a `KeyError` as expected when using a list as the `key` input.
- The GitHub issue discusses the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different data types.
- The bug is related to how indexing using a list is handled within the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the `key` is a list and the function reaches the block `if not is_list_like(key)`, which then calls `self.loc[key]`.
- The error message in the failing test is due to the fact that the list is not directly supported as an index in this scenario, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue arises from the different treatment of various data types as indexers, especially when a list is used.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the section of the function that handles non-list-like objects to accommodate lists.
- Update the logic to handle list indexers consistently with other data types.
- Ensure that when indexing with a list, the behavior aligns with the expected result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, list):
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Solution:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now correctly handles list indexers, ensuring a consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This fix addresses the inconsistency reported in the failing test and aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
