### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` file.
2. The function is aimed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series` object.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key being passed, causing inconsistency in handling various types of indexers.
4. The failing test is checking the behavior of indexing a `Series` object with a `list` type key. It expects a `KeyError` to be raised but the function does not raise it in this scenario, leading to the test failure.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling indexers of different types such as list, numpy array, Index, and Series. It points out that indexing with a list should behave similarly to other array-like indexers. The issue proposes a change in behavior to make them consistent.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not correctly handle list-like keys. When a list-like key is passed, the function does not raise a `KeyError` as expected in the failing test. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers leads to the test failure.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles list-like keys in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. We should modify the section of code responsible for dealing with list keys to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError as e:
            raise e

    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check for list-like keys using the `is_list_like` function.
2. Raised a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index when using a list-like key.
3. Ensured consistent error handling for list-like keys to align with other array-like indexers.

These changes aim to fix the bug and make the function `_get_with` behave consistently when dealing with different types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
