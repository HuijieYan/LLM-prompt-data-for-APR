### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method within the `Series` class in the pandas library. It is used for retrieving data from a Series object based on the provided key.
2. The bug occurs when attempting to access elements using a list-like key. The function is not handling the list key as expected, leading to a KeyError.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects an error due to the incorrect behavior when using a list key.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list key is provided, the function handles it correctly by reindexing the Series.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function does not handle list-like keys properly and incorrectly tries to access them directly with `.loc` instead of reindexing the Series by the key.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly handle list-like keys:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle list-like keys correctly, we ensure that the Series object can be accessed and indexed without errors.

This fix should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected when dealing with different types of keys.
