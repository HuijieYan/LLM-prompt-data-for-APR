### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys passed for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `test_getitem.py` is testing the behavior when trying to access a key that is not present in the index.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected when a key is not found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of keys.
4. The GitHub issue highlights that there is inconsistency in the behavior when using different types of indexers.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys passed for indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the different behavior in the handling of list-like keys for indexing compared to other types of indexers. The implementation of `_get_with` function does not properly handle the case when a list-like key is passed, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
- Ensure that when a list-like key is passed, a KeyError should be raised if none of the elements in the key are found in the index.
- The behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = self.index.intersection(key)
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list-like keys has been modified to intersect the key with the Series index. If none of the elements in the key are found in the index, a KeyError is raised.

This correction ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
