### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
- The function is meant to handle different types of indexers (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, etc.) and return the appropriate results.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing behavior when using a list-like key to index a `Series`.
- The error message indicates that the test did not raise a `KeyError` as expected when a non-existent key is used to index the `Series`.

### Bug Identification:
- The bug is likely related to how the function `_get_with` handles the case when a list-like key is provided.
- The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when a non-existent key is used, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, resulting in a failed test.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function.
- When a list key is provided, the function should raise a `KeyError` if the key does not exist in the index of the `Series`.
- The current implementation does not appropriately handle this case and does not raise a `KeyError` as expected by the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like key is provided to index the `Series`, the function should raise a `KeyError` if the key does not exist in the index.
- We can modify the code to correctly handle this case and raise the `KeyError` when necessary.
- We should also ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

### Updated Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
- Added a check to ensure that if a list-like key is provided, we check if any of the elements in the key are present in the index of the `Series`.
- If none of the elements from the key are found in the index, raise a `KeyError` with a message indicating the missing keys.
- This change ensures that the function correctly handles the case when a non-existent key is used to index a `Series`.

### With this corrected version, the `test_getitem_no_matches` should now pass successfully and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
