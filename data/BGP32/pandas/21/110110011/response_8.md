### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
- The function is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, and more.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when providing an index that does not match any value in the series.
- The error message indicates that the test did not raise a `KeyError` as expected.
- The GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in how different indexers are handled, specifically when using a list as an indexer which leads to incorrect behavior.
- The key issue seems to be with how list-like indexers are being processed compared to other types.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- When a list-like indexer is provided, it should raise a `KeyError` if the values are not in the series index.
- The current implementation of processing list-like indexers does not raise the appropriate error when no matches are found.
- This leads to incorrect behavior in the case when using a list indexer, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic for processing list-like indexers to ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when no matches are found in the series index.
- This will align the behavior of list indexers with other types and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Raise KeyError if key is not list-like and not found in the index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Raise KeyError if none of the values in the key are found in the index
        if all(val not in self.index for val in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected logic, it now ensures that list-like indexers raise a `KeyError` when none of the values are found in the series index. This fix aligns the behavior with other types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
