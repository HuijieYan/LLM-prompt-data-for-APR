### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
2. The function contains multiple conditionals for different types of input keys.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior for different types of key inputs like list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The test expects the same behavior for all input types, which is not consistent due to the bug in the `_get_with` function.
4. The bug is causing inconsistency in behavior for different types of input keys.
5. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and provides an example where the behavior differs for list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the different handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, it falls into the conditional `elif not is_list_like(key):` and tries to access `self.loc[key]`. However, in the failing test, this results in a `KeyError` because the key is not found in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that all types of input keys are handled consistently. We should treat list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers to maintain uniform behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the behavior for list indexers should align with the handling of other array-like indexers, ensuring consistency across different types of key inputs. This fix should allow the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` to pass as expected.
