### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function takes a `key` parameter and is responsible for indexing operations on a `Series` object.
3. In the failing test, the `key` is created as a Series of ["C"] and then converted to different types like list, numpy array, Index, and Series for testing.
4. The failing test expects a KeyError to be raised due to the mismatch between the index and the key because "C" is not part of the index in the `ser` Series.
5. The provided error messages from the failing tests show that the KeyError was not raised as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `key` type inside the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list, the function does not properly process it, leading to an unexpected result when indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list, it is handled correctly to match the behavior of other data types like numpy array or Index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # previous code...

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # Always use loc for list-based indexers
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By specifically handling the case when `key` is a list by using `self.loc[key]`, we can ensure that the correct indexing behavior is maintained across different types of indexers, resolving the bug.
