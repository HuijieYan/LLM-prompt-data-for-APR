### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class.
- **Buggy Class**: `Series` class in the pandas library.
- **Failing Test**: The failing test is checking the behavior when using list-like indexers on a `Series` object.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the test did not raise a `KeyError`.
- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers in pandas.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of different data types for `key`.
2. Incorrect indexing based on data type of `key`.
3. Failure to reindex properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistency in the behavior of different types of indexers when passed to a `Series` object. The failing test is checking the behavior for list-like indexers. The code in the `_get_with` function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers passed to the `Series` object. Specifically, we need to handle list indexers appropriately to avoid the `KeyError` that is currently being raised in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Fix the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, ABCDataFrame)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key_type = 'integer'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed"):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers properly and provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers passed to the `Series` object. This change should address the issue reported in the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue regarding the inconsistency in indexing behavior.
