### Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling indexing operations in a pandas Series. The function checks the type of the key provided and performs different operations based on the type of the key.

### Identify potential error locations

1. The function checks if the key is a list-like object, but the handling in the subsequent condition might be incorrect.
2. The conversion of the key to a list in the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition might not cover all cases correctly.

### Explain the cause of the bug

The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list-like object in a Series. The bug results in different error messages for different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer. This inconsistency leads to a failed test case where a `KeyError` is expected, but it is not raised due to the incorrect handling within the `_get_with` function.

### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the same behavior is applied for all types of indexers, especially when using list indexers. By properly handling list-like objects and ensuring consistent error messages, we can resolve the issue and pass the failing test.

### Corrected version of the function

A corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer"]:  # Updated this condition
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list-like objects are properly converted to an index and handling different key types consistently, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
