### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function contains multiple condition checks based on the type of `key`.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior when trying to access a key that is not present in the index. The test parametrizes different types of `key` inputs.
4. The error message indicates that the expected `KeyError` was not raised when trying to access a key that is not present in the index.
5. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior of indexing with different types of indexers (list, array-like, etc.).

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs when the `key` is of type `list`.
2. For a `list` type `key`, the function tries to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]`, which doesn't work as expected.
3. The error message from the failing test confirms that the behavior for a `list` type `key` is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Handle the case when `key` is of type `list` correctly to ensure consistency with other types of indexers.
2. Update the logic to handle a `list` type `key` similar to how array-like indexers are handled.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic for handling `list` type keys and ensuring consistency with other types of indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
