### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with()` in the `Series` class is used for indexing operations, specifically to handle different types of input keys.
2. The bug seems to arise from how the function handles a list-like input key, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior of indexing with a key that has no matches in the series index. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message, but the original function is not handling this case correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for different types of input keys, including list-like keys that do not match any index values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the case when the input key is list-like and does not match any index values. The original implementation in `_get_with()` does not properly handle this situation and raises a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with()` function to handle list-like input keys that do not match any index values. By checking for this condition and raising a `KeyError` with the appropriate message, we can ensure consistent behavior across different types of input keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 0:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check for an empty list-like key and raising a `KeyError` with the appropriate message, we ensure that the behavior is consistent for all different types of input keys. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
