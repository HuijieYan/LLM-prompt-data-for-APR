### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing elements of a Series. The GitHub issue relates to the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially with lists that have no matches. The issue points out that when using `ser[list(key)]`, a KeyError is raised, whereas it behaves differently when using other indexers like `ser[key]`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The code block for handling indexers of type `list`.
2. The reindex call when no matches are found.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in handling list indexers with no matches. Since the behavior for different types of indexers is not aligned, it leads to unexpected results and errors, as pointed out in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency, we need to ensure that the behavior for list indexers is handled correctly when there are no matches. This may involve updating the logic for list indexers and refining the reindex call to handle cases where no matches are found without raising errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not self.index.is_unique or not self.index.isin(key).all():
            return self.reindex(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional checks to handle the case when providing a list indexer with no matches. By checking if the index is unique and if all elements of the list are present in the index, we can avoid raising errors when no matches are found. This aligns the behavior with the expectation outlined in the GitHub issue.
