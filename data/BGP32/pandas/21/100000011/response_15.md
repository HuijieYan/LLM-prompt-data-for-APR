### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is a method in the `Series` class of pandas library. This function is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Index objects, etc., and then making relevant operations based on the type of indexer.

### Potential Errors:
1. The if-elif statements for different types of indexers might not cover all possible cases.
2. The handling of `list` indexers might not be consistent with expected behavior in certain scenarios.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue reported on GitHub suggests that there is inconsistency in how different indexers are handled, specifically when using a `list` indexer. The function `_get_with` is likely not properly handling the `list` indexers, causing unexpected behavior and inconsistency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure the `_get_with` function properly handles all types of indexers, including `list` indexers.
2. Address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue by making the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.dtype == np.bool_:
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version, a specific check has been added for `np.ndarray` with dtype `bool`, allowing it to be handled correctly. Additionally, the handling of `list` indexers has been modified to ensure consistency and avoid issues reported in the GitHub bug.
