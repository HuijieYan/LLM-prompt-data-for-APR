### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series object.
2. The buggy function checks the type of the indexer (key) and based on the type, it performs different actions such as slicing, handling DataFrame inputs, converting to positional index, etc.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled when indexing a Series. Specifically, the issue mentions the difference in behavior when using a list as an indexer compared to using an array-like indexer.
4. The bug in the `_get_with` function might be related to the way list-like indexers are handled, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug could be caused by the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is not recognized as list-like, the function tries to fall back to positional or label-based indexing based on the type of the key. This might lead to incorrect indexing behavior when dealing with actual list-like input cases.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug and align the behavior with the expected outcomes for different types of indexers mentioned in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently and correctly within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle cases where key is not recognized as list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list indexers consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have modified the handling of list-like indexers specifically. By checking if the key is not list-like before other checks, we ensure that list indexers are consistently treated the same way as other types of indexers. This change aligns with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug related to inconsistent behavior when using list-like indexers.
