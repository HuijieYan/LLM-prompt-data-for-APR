### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is aimed at retrieving values from a pandas Series using different types of keys. The issue referenced on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function.

### Potential error locations:
1. The `if not is_list_like(key)` condition might be incorrect.
2. The handling of list indexers in the function seems to be inconsistent.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug causes a KeyError when using a list key to index a Series, and the error is related to how list indexers are treated within the function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This will involve refining the conditions and logic for list indexers.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a condition to handle list indexers separately and consistently with other indexers in the function. This should address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
