### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing operations on a pandas Series object. The GitHub issue highlights a specific inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in pandas Series.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `elif not is_list_like(key):` condition may not be handling the list indexer case correctly.
2. The `if isinstance(key, list):` condition might be incorrectly handling the list indexer case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is caused by the improper handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior which contradicts the expected behavior shown in the GitHub issue. Specifically, the `if not is_list_like(key):` condition may not be correctly identifying list indexers, and the subsequent handling of the list case may be incorrect, leading to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with array-like indexers as described in the GitHub issue. We should correct the conditions that determine the indexer type and adjust the handling accordingly to provide the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've adjusted the conditions to handle list indexers correctly and consistently with array-like indexers. Now, the function should address the issue raised in the GitHub post by ensuring that list indexers behave in the expected manner.
