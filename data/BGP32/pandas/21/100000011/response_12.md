### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for indexing a Series object based on the provided key. The function checks for various types of keys such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc., and handles them accordingly. The main issue arises when the key is of type list. The function reindexes when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, causing inconsistencies in behavior as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the handling of key when it is of type list, leading to an incorrect reindexing operation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with a key that is a list. The function attempts to reindex in such cases, but this does not produce the expected behavior, resulting in an error or incorrect values being returned.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the key is a list more consistently to align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue. We should avoid reindexing in cases where the key is a list and instead handle it in a way that matches other indexing methods such as using the `loc` indexer.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation:
The corrected function now handles the case when the key is a list by using the `loc` indexer instead of reindexing. This change aligns with the behavior of other indexing methods and helps in resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue. Now, when the key is a list, the function will correctly use the `loc` indexer to access the elements in the Series object.
