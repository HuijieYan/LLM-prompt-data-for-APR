### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a series in pandas. The bug seems to be related to how the function treats list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. The GitHub issue points out that there is inconsistency in the behavior when indexing a series with a list index.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition to handle list-like keys in the function may be incorrect.
2. The way the function decides to treat the key as positional or label-based could be causing the issue for list indexers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when a list is used as an indexer, the function does not behave consistently as with other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to an error when using a list as an index, as pointed out in the GitHub issue. The function needs to be fixed to treat list indexers in a consistent manner.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function treats list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers. This may involve adjusting the conditions and checks related to handling list-like keys in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditions in the function to handle list-like keys in a consistent way with other array-like indexers, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem regarding the inconsistent behavior when indexing a series with list indexers.
