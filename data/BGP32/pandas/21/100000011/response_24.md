### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series. The issue described on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition might not correctly categorize the type of key.
2. The handling of different key types, especially when it comes to lists, might not be consistent.
3. The reindexing step at the end might not work as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises from the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when attempting to index a Series using a list as the key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are treated consistently, especially when it comes to lists. We should align the behavior of list indexers with array-like indexers while maintaining the functionality and integrity of the indexing process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, I have adjusted the conditional check for lists, ensuring that they are handled similarly to other array-like indexers. This adjustment should help address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
