### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is used to determine the type of indexing key passed to a Pandas Series object and perform the indexing operation accordingly. The function checks if the key is of type slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple, or other types before deciding how to handle the indexing operation.

### Potential error locations:
1. The function may not correctly handle the case when the key is a list.
2. The function determines the `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype`, which may not be appropriate for all cases.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the function not consistently handling list indexers compared to other types like array-like indexers. This inconsistency causes issues when trying to index a Series with a list that does not match any values in the index.

### Bug-fix strategy:
1. Ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers.
2. Adjust the logic for determining the `key_type` to cover all potential cases of indexing keys.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like indexers consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Bug fixed:
The corrected version of the function now handles list indexers consistently with array-like indexers by directly using `self.loc[key]` for list-like indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent across different index types. This fix aligns with the issue raised on GitHub and resolves the inconsistency in how Series indexing is handled.
