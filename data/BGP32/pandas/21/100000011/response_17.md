### Analyzing the Buggy Function
The function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a pandas Series. The buggy function has a logic issue that causes unexpected behavior when indexing with a list. This issue is related to a GitHub issue discussing inconsistencies between different types of indexers.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when indexing with a list, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially causing a KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including a list, are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. This involves making sure that the function correctly processes a list indexer to avoid any KeyErrors or inconsistencies.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle key as list to ensure consistency
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the key is treated as an Index object before further processing and handling lists consistently within the function, we can fix the bug and address the issue highlighted on GitHub regarding inconsistencies in how different indexers are treated.
