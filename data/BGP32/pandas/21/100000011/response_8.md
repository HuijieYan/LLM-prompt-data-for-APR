### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key input for indexing a Series in Pandas. It contains a variety of conditional statements to check the type of the key and then perform the indexing operation accordingly. The issue on GitHub highlights a specific inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and KeyError in certain cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional checks for key types might not cover all possible cases leading to incorrect handling.
2. The conversion of the key to a list could result in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency leads to unexpected KeyErrors when using lists as indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure consistent handling across different types of indexers and avoid coercing all input keys to lists to prevent unexpected behavior. Specifically, address the issue related to list indexers causing KeyErrors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like but not a scalar
    if is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list indexers has been revised to ensure consistency with other types of indexers. Instead of coercing all keys to lists, a check for list-like and non-scalar keys has been introduced. This should address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report and prevent the unexpected KeyError when using list indexers.
