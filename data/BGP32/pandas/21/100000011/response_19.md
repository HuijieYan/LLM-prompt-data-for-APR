### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object. The function has multiple condition checks based on the type of the `key` parameter provided. The buggy part of the function is when it tries to handle the case where `key` is a list or array-like object.

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The handling of `key` when it is not recognized as `list_like`.
2. The conversion of `key` to a list when it is not of type `list`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers for a Series object, specifically with list-like or array-like objects. The bug causes unexpected behavior and inconsistent error handling based on the type of the index provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent error handling and behavior when using list-like or array-like indexers. The code should be modified to handle all types of indexers uniformly and provide appropriate error messages when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except Exception:
            pass

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version aims to handle all types of indexers uniformly and provide better error handling for cases where the key is not list-like. By improving the error handling and consistency, the function should now behave as expected and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
