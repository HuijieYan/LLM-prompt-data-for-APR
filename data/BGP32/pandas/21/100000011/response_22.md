### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling indexing cases in a Pandas Series object. The main issue identified in the GitHub report is related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers. When using a list indexer that contains no matches, it raises an error, whereas other types of indexers do not raise an error.

### Error Location:
- The bug is likely occurring in the `return self.loc[key]` statement when `key` is a list that contains no matches.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by how the function `_get_with` handles list indexers with no matches. Instead of returning gracefully with NaN values, it raises an error when using `self.loc[key]` with a list that doesn't exist in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling list indexers with no matches. We should aim to make the behavior consistent across all types of indexers to align with user expectations.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Check if any of the items in the key matches the index
        if any(item in self.index for item in key):
            return self.loc[key]  # Return values that match the index
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)  # Reindex with the specified key

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check before returning `self.loc[key]` for a list key. This check ensures that if none of the items in the key exist in the index, we perform a reindex operation instead of raising an error. This adjustment aligns the behavior with user expectations and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
