### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different kinds of key input to retrieve values from a Series object. The function has conditional statements to handle different types of key inputs and determine how to process them based on their type. The bug seems to be related to inconsistent handling of list-like key input compared to other types.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block, the buggy function tries to access the value using `self.loc[key]`, which might raise a KeyError if the key does not exist.
2. The check `if isinstance(key, list):` followed by `return self.loc[key]` might not handle cases where the key does not exist in the Series.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is related to inconsistent handling of list-like key input compared to other types like Index, numpy.ndarray, etc. It seems like the bug occurs when the key provided is a list that does not match any indexes in the Series. This results in a KeyError being raised due to the use of `self.loc[key]`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how list-like keys are handled to ensure consistency with other types of keys. The goal is to handle cases where the key does not exist in the Series without raising a KeyError.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle cases where key is not list-like
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are converted into lists and handled correctly without raising errors when the key does not match any indexes in the Series.
