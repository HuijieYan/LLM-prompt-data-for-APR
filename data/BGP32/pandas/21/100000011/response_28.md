## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used for indexing a pandas Series object with a given key.
2. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how the behavior differs when indexing a Series with a list of items that don't match any values in the Series.
4. The key issue seems to be the inconsistency in error handling and behavior between different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer doesn't have any matching values in the Series.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the `_get_with` function treating list indexers differently from other indexers, leading to inconsistency in behavior when the key does not have any matching values in the Series. This leads to confusion and error messages that are inconsistent.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with list indexers that do not have any matching values in the Series. We should align the error handling and return behavior for different types of indexers to achieve consistency.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        if len(self.loc[key]) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we added a check after determining that the key is a list or ndarray to ensure that if the resulting indexer does not have any matching values in the Series, a `KeyError` is raised for consistency. This aligns the behavior with the expectation described in the GitHub issue.
