### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for handling different types of indexers passed to a Series object in pandas. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on its type. However, there seems to be a bug in how the function handles non-matching indexers, specifically when the key is a list. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when trying to index a Series with a list key.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block for handling non-matching indexers is not adequately distinguishing different types of key inputs.
2. The code for handling lists as key indexers is problematic and may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistencies in indexing behavior. The issue reported on GitHub highlights how indexing a Series with a list key causes unexpected behavior and raises a KeyError in some cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles list indexers consistently and accurately. Specifically, we need to address the improper handling of list keys and ensure that the function behaves correctly regardless of the type of key passed for indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Changes Made:
1. Added a check `is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index` to handle scalar key inputs that are not present in the index.
2. Used `ensure_index(key)` to ensure the correct format of the key regardless of its type.
3. Removed unnecessary checks and consolidated handling of list key indexers.
4. Introduced a consistent flow for different types of key inputs to improve the overall indexing behavior of the function.
