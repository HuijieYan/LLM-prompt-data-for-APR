### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a Series object. The function checks for the type of the key provided and performs different actions based on the type. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers when accessing a Series.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-like key in the function.
2. Conversion of key to a list if it is not already a list.
3. Returning values based on the key type.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the function when dealing with list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function does not handle list-like keys appropriately, leading to errors when trying to access a Series object with a list key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers.
2. Check for list-like keys and handle them without raising errors.
3. Avoid unnecessary type conversions of the key.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle list-like key without converting to list
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles list-like keys without raising errors and ensures consistent behavior when accessing a Series object with different types of indexers.
