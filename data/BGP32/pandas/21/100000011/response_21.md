### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is used to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object in pandas. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a Series with list-like keys compared to array-like keys. The key point of the issue is that `ser[list(key)]` raises a `KeyError` while `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` do not. This inconsistency needs to be addressed in the `_get_with` function to align with the expected behavior.

### Identified Error:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the blocks where different key types are checked and handled. Specifically, the condition where `is_list_like(key)` is checked might cause the incorrect behavior with list-like keys.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is related to the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function does not correctly handle list-like keys, leading to a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different key types. List-like keys should be handled in a way that aligns with the behavior of array-like keys. Specifically, when indexing with a list-like key, the function should return `NaN` for items not found in the index.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, list-like keys are handled consistently with array-like keys. If the key is list-like, it directly uses `self.loc[key]` which should properly return `NaN` for items not found in the index. This fix aligns the behavior with the expected outcome and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
