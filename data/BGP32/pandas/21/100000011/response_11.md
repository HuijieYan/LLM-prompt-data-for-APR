### Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas` library. It is related to how list indexers are handled differently from other indexers. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers in a pandas Series.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. The condition for handling non-list-like keys may not be accurate.
2. The differentiation between list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index types might not be handled correctly.
3. The handling of duplicate indexes could be improved.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers when accessing a Series in pandas. Different behaviors are observed when using list indexers that include similar elements to the Series, leading to unexpected outcomes causing the bug.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Reevaluate the conditions for handling non-list-like keys to improve accuracy.
2. Revise the logic for handling different types of keys (list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index) to ensure consistent behavior.
3. Enhance the method for dealing with duplicate indexes to align with the desired functionality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as shown above, the bug regarding inconsistent behavior with list indexers in pandas Series should be resolved, thus maintaining the intended functionality described in the GitHub issue.
