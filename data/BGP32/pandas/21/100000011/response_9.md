### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers passed to a Pandas Series object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers when accessing Series data. The issue highlights that passing a list indexer that has no matches results in inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition where `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` may not properly handle list indexers with no matches.
2. The `return self.reindex(key)` statement at the end may not handle the scenario of a list indexer with no matches correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the improper handling of list indexers with no matches in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer with no matches is passed, it seems that the `self.reindex(key)` call at the end is causing unexpected behavior due to a mismatch in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. We should pay particular attention to how list indexers with no matches are treated to align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 0:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers with no matches are handled appropriately to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
