### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when trying to get values from a Series. The issue is related to inconsistent behavior when using list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers. The bug is causing unexpected KeyError when using list-like indexers.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block and the subsequent handling of list-like keys.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior in the handling of list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers. The issue arises when using list-like key with `ser[list(key)]`. This is related to how the indexing method interprets the key as a list instead of an array.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the handling of list-like indexers needs to be modified to match the behavior of array-like indexers. The correct behavior should not raise a KeyError when using list-like indexers. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self._get_values(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert to list if not already a list-like object

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list-like indexers are converted to list objects before processing them, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys without raising a KeyError and exhibit consistent behavior with array-like indexers.
