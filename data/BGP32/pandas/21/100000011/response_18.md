**Analysis:**

The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series in pandas. The function checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on the type. One of the important sections is where it handles `list` type indexers and decides whether to use `self.loc`, `self.iloc`, or `self.reindex`.

**Identified Potential Error Locations:**
1. The handling of the `list` type indexers seems to be problematic as per the GitHub issue description.
2. The `isinstance(key, Index)` condition might not work as intended.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The cause of the bug could be related to the way `list` indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. The function may not handle `list` indexers correctly, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly handles the `list` type indexers similar to other array-like indexers. This involves updating the logic for processing `list` indexers to align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if all(not is_scalar(k) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, the condition for handling `list` type indexers has been updated to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers. By specifically checking for non-scalar elements in the `key`, it ensures that the correct operation is performed for `list` type indexers.

This correction should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and provide a more robust handling of different types of indexers in pandas Series.
