### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Pandas Series. The function contains multiple conditions to determine the type of indexer given and return the corresponding result.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The condition `elif isinstance(key, tuple): return self._get_values_tuple(key)` could potentially cause an issue if the tuple is not correctly handled.
2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)): key = list(key)` seems unnecessary and may cause issues.
3. The handling of different types of key, specifically when checking for `key_type == "integer"` might need modifications.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent behavior when indexing a Pandas Series with different types of indexers. The specific issue reported in the GitHub issue is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers. The error message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]" indicates a problem with indexing behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of indexers, regardless of whether they are lists, arrays, or other types. We can modify the conditions inside the `_get_with` function to handle different indexers uniformly. Additionally, we need to address the specific issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function aims to handle different indexers uniformly and address the specific inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue. By making these modifications, we can ensure that the function behaves consistently when indexing a Pandas Series with different types of indexers.
