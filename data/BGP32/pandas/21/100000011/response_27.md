### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc., in a Pandas Series object. The bug seems to arise from how the function handles the case when `key` is a list. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with lists compared to indexing with other array-like objects.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The bug might be in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block, where it falls back to `self.loc[key]`.
2. The handling of the case when `key` is a list might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `key` is a list, the function is trying to process it as an index, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to when `key` is an array-like object. This inconsistency leads to unexpected errors and behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the case when `key` is a list similar to how it handles other array-like objects to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle list-like key similar to other array-like objects
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the list indexing case consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like objects. It ensures that lists are processed similarly to arrays, indices, and other array-like objects, leading to more predictable and consistent behavior when indexing a Pandas Series.
