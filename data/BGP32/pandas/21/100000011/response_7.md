### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the pandas `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Series. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers. The primary concern is that using a list for indexing results in an error, while using other array-like indexers, like Pandas Index or NumPy arrays, does not raise an error.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function does not appropriately handle list indexers, leading to the reported inconsistency and error.
2. In the case where the indexer `key` is a list, the code tries to access the indexer using the `loc` method, which raises an error when the key is not found.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not treating list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. The implementation tries to access the index using the `loc` method, which results in an error if the key is not found in the index.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To address this issue and achieve consistency in handling different types of indexers, we need to modify the code block that deals with list indexers. Instead of directly using the `loc` method for list indexers, we should reindex the Series with the list key to handle potential missing values gracefully.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, when a list is encountered as the indexer `key`, we directly call `reindex(key)` to handle any missing values gracefully. This modification aligns the handling of list indexers with other array-like indexers, improving consistency and resolving the reported inconsistency.
