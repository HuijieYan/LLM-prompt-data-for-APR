### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Pandas Series object. The issue described on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers like array-like or Index objects.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of list-like indexers.
2. Inconsistent behavior when using list indexers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The function `_get_with` does not properly handle list-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when trying to index a Pandas Series with a list that has no matches in the index. This inconsistency causes confusion and unexpected errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently across different types of indexers. This involves handling the case where a list indexer does not have any matches in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if len(key) == 0:  # Handle the case where the key is an empty list
            return pd.Series(index=[], dtype=self.dtype)  # Return an empty series
        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle the case of duplicate indexing
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a check to handle the case where the indexer (key) is an empty list. This check ensures that when indexing with an empty list, an empty Series is returned instead of raising an error. By making this adjustment, we aim to address the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
