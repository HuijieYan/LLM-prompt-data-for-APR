### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key inputs and return the appropriate sliced values from the Series object. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like input key values.

### Error Location
The bug is likely within the code block that checks for list-like key values and how it processes them.

### Bug Cause
Based on the provided expected cases and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug arises when the function encounters a list-like key input. The function currently incorrectly treats the case of a key being a list, which results in an issue when trying to index it. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected behavior according to the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should adjust how list-like key inputs are handled within the function. The function should be updated to correctly handle list-like keys based on the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This version of the function includes a specific handling for list-like keys and ensures that the function behaves consistently with the expected behavior based on the provided input cases and the information from the GitHub issue.
