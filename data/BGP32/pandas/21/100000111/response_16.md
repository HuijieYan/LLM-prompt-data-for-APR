## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs to retrieve values from a Series object. However, it fails to correctly evaluate some input types, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential errors. The function should distinguish between different types of indexers and properly return the corresponding values from the Series object.

## Identified Issue
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of various key types, especially when dealing with list-like keys, which causes inconsistencies in behavior as described in the GitHub issue. The function does not correctly differentiate between different types of indexers, leading to errors or unexpected results when accessing the Series object.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function does not handle list-like key inputs consistently with other types. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and errors, as noted in the GitHub issue.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that list-like key inputs are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This involves correctly distinguishing between key types, such as lists, arrays, and indices, and returning the values accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other indexers, addressing the bug and satisfying the expected input/output values described in the GitHub issue.
