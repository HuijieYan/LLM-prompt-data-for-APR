### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is a specific issue related to how list-like keys are processed, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency, specifically when using a list key resulting in a KeyError.

### Error Location
The error is likely in the section where the function deals with the `not is_list_like(key)` branch and the subsequent type checks for different key types.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from how the function processes various types of keys. When a list-like key is encountered, it should follow a consistent path for indexing, akin to ndarray or Index types. However, the function's implementation deviates from this expected behavior, as seen in the GitHub issue example.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, ensure that all list-like keys are treated consistently and correctly in the indexing process. The function should handle list keys in the same manner as ndarray or Index types, resolving the observed inconsistency.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now consistently handle list-like keys along with other types, ensuring that the indexing behavior is coherent and aligns with the expected outcomes outlined in the GitHub issue.
