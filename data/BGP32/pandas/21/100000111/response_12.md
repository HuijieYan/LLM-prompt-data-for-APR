The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue when handling different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, Index objects, and Series. It fails to differentiate between them correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in certain cases.

The main cause of the bug is the mishandling of the `key_type` determination logic within the function, leading to incorrect indexing behavior. The logic where it checks for the key type as an integer is causing issues when dealing with other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of the input key correctly and provide the appropriate indexing behavior for different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not is_bool(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes proper checks for different types of indexers and handles the indexing based on the actual type of the input key. It considers boolean indexers separately and ensures that the function behaves correctly for various indexer types based on the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue and the provided test cases.
