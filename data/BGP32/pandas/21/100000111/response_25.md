### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` aims to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. There are branching conditions to handle various scenarios like slices, DataFrame indexers, tuples, scalar values, list-like inputs, and different kinds of arrays. The bug seems to arise from the faulty logic in the handling of the `list` type key input.

### Identified Bugs
1. The function fails to correctly handle the case when the key input is of type `list`.
2. The key_type is not being appropriately inferred in certain conditions which could lead to incorrect indexing decisions.

### Explanation
The issue described on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. The buggy function's incorrect handling of the `list` type key input could lead to exceptions or unexpected behavior when attempting to index by a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle `list` type indexers and determine the key_type accurately to make appropriate indexing decisions.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the reindexing case for other types of keys
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the `list` type key input and ensure that the key_type is inferred correctly to make appropriate indexing decisions. The function should now return the expected output for all the provided test cases and resolve the GitHub issue mentioned.
