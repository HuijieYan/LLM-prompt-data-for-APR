### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is encountering issues specifically when dealing with different types of indexers such as list-like indexers, integer indexers, and Index objects. The key issue arises from the handling of these various types of indexers leading to inconsistent behavior based on the type of the input key.

### Identified Errors:
1. Incorrect handling of different types of indexers based on the input key.
2. Lack of consistent behavior for list-like indexers, integer indexers, and Index objects.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in handling list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers (ndarray, Index objects) within the `_get_with` function. Due to this inconsistency, the function may not return the expected output for cases involving list-like indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers such as list-like indexers, integer indexers, and Index objects. This involves correctly identifying the type of the key passed to `_get_with` and implementing appropriate actions based on that type to return the expected output consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers (list-like, array-like, Index objects) are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. It should now return the expected output for all the provided test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior based on different types of indexers.
