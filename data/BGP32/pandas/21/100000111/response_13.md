The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` seems to have an issue with handling different types of indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior as reported in the GitHub issue related to `ser.loc[key]` raising an error for different indexers.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to arise from the way different types of indexers are handled, leading to inconsistent behavior for list indexers compared to other types like arrays or Index objects.

### Cause of the Bug:
The issue stems from the fact that the function is treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior and raising errors in certain cases where it shouldn't. This causes discrepancies between how the function handles different types of indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should adjust the logic to treat list indexers in a similar manner to other array-like indexers to avoid the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = np.array(key).dtype  # Assuming key is an array-like object

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By introducing checks for various array-like indexers and handling list indexers similarly to other types, the corrected function aims to address the inconsistency and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
