### Analysis:
The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there are potential issues in the code related to handling indexers like list, ndarray, and Index objects. The buggy function does not correctly handle Index objects and needs to be fixed to adhere to the expected behavior in the GitHub issue.

### Bugs:
1. Incorrect handling of Index objects.
2. Inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect conditional branching in the function, leading to improper handling of Index objects. This inconsistency can result in errors when accessing data in a Series object with various types of indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to revise the conditional branches for handling different types of indexers, especially Index objects. Additionally, the function should ensure consistency in behavior when accessing data with list, ndarray, or Index objects.

### Updated Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function with the above code, we make sure to correctly handle the indexing based on the inferred type of the key. This modification should address the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
