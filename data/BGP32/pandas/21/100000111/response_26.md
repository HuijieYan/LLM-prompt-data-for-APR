### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to handle different types of key input parameters and return the appropriate sliced data. However, there is an issue with the implementation where the key parameter types are not handled correctly, leading to potential errors. For example, the function fails to appropriately differentiate between list-like key inputs and other types of key objects, resulting in unexpected behavior based on the input type.

### Identified Issue:
The primary issue lies in the condition checks for different key types within the function. The logic for handling list-like keys, indices, and other types is not accurately distinguishing between them. This impacts the flow of the function and ends up returning unexpected results or raising errors.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not properly differentiating between list-like keys, Index objects, and other key types in the function `_get_with`. This discrepancy in handling different key types leads to incorrect slicing behavior or error generation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function accurately identifies and handles various key types such as lists, Index objects, NumPy arrays, etc. Each key type should be processed appropriately to return the expected output without generating errors. Proper type checking and handling conditions need to be implemented in the function to resolve this issue.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key].reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues related to handling different key types, ensuring that the function behaves as expected based on the input key type. It includes proper checks for scalar values, list-like keys, and Index objects, resolving the inconsistencies found in the buggy version.
