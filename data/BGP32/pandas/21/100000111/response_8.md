## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of indexers, particularly when the key is a `list`. The function currently treats lists differently from other kinds of indexers, which leads to inconsistencies and errors.

The bug is related to a GitHub issue where the behavior of `Series` when indexed with different types of objects is questioned. The report highlights discrepancies in how `Series` handles indexers like lists compared to array-like or `Index` objects.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to handle all types of indexers consistently, ensuring that the behavior remains the same regardless of whether the key is a list, `Index` object, `ndarray`, or any other valid type. This will align the behavior with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

The fix involves modifying the conditional statements to treat all types of indexers uniformly and eliminate the issues raised in the GitHub report regarding inconsistencies in behavior.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all types of indexers consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function addresses the inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers and aligns the behavior with the expected input/output values and the requirements outlined in the GitHub issue.
