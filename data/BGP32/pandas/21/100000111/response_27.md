### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like key inputs, as shown by the GitHub issue description. The issue points out inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically highlighting the case of `ser[list(key)]` raising an error. 

### Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the block where the function checks for list-like key inputs and decides between using `loc` or `iloc` based on the type of key. It seems that the function is not handling list indexers correctly compared to other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the inconsistent handling of list-like key inputs, leading to unexpected behavior when attempting to index a Series using a list. The function is not correctly handling lists as indexers, resulting in a KeyError as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like types. This involves modifying the logic in the function to correctly handle list-like key inputs to avoid the KeyError issue and ensure the function behaves as expected based on the input type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key inputs
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case for list indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the function to handle list-like key inputs just like other array-like types, we can ensure that the behavior is consistent and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report. This corrected version addresses the bug and aligns the function's logic with the expected input/output values.
