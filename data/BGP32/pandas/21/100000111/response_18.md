### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series object. However, there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior. The function incorrectly handles the case when `key` is a list that has no matches with the Series index.

### Error Locations:
1. The function wrongly treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing issues with matching and returning NaN values.
2. There is a lack of proper handling for list indexers with no matches in the Series index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the inaccurate distinction made by the function when processing different types of indexers, specifically failing to handle list indexers appropriately, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This results in inconsistencies in returning expected values for certain input cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers, particularly list indexers. We should address the special case where a list indexer has no matching values in the Series index and handle it appropriately to avoid errors and unexpected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the duplicate indexing case
        if len(set(key) & set(self.index)) == 0:
            return pd.Series(index=self.index, dtype=self.dtype)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list indexers with no matches in the Series index by returning a Series with the same index and dtype. This fix ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.
