### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs and return the corresponding slice of the Series. However, there are inconsistencies in how different types of keys are handled, especially when dealing with lists.

### Identified Issue:
The issue arises from how list-like keys are processed. In the buggy function, when the key is not recognized as list-like and is not an integer, the function attempts to access the key using `self.loc[key]`, which may lead to unexpected behavior, especially for list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect behavior in the function due to discrepancies in handling list-like keys, leading to potential KeyErrors or wrong results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys consistently and efficiently. We should revise the logic for list-like keys to avoid incorrect access attempts and provide the expected results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By revising the logic for list-like keys and ensuring that they are handled consistently, we can address the issue raised in the GitHub report and provide the expected outputs for the identified test cases.
