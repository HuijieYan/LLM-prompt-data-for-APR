### Analysis
The function `_get_with` seems to handle different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects. The bug occurs in the handling of list-like indexers, where it fails to return the correct result. This issue is related to handling list indexers differently from other array-like indexers.

### Error Location
The bug is likely happening in the section of the code handling list-like indexers because the list case is not consistent with how other array-like indexers are treated.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistency in the behavior of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like indexers to make it consistent with the treatment of other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency issue mentioned in the GitHub problem statement.
