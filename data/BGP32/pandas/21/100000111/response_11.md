### Analyzing the buggy function
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of indexing keys for a Series object. It checks the type of the key and then decides how to handle the indexing. The bug seems to occur when the key is a list type, causing unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results.

### Error location
The issue in the buggy function arises in the section that handles list-like keys. It appears that the function is not correctly identifying list-like keys and processing them accordingly.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling list-like keys, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors. This is particularly problematic when dealing with a Series object and trying to index it using a list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic related to list-like keys. The function should differentiate between various types of keys correctly and handle list-like keys appropriately to ensure the expected behavior and results.

### Corrected version of the function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that list-like keys are correctly identified and processed. We convert ndarray and ExtensionArray types to lists before handling them, ensuring consistency in indexing behavior. This correction should address the issue related to list indexers and provide the expected results for the given test cases.
