### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of `key` input to return the corresponding values from the Series object. However, there are mismatches in the handling of different types of keys. In the provided test cases, we have instances where the expected output does not match the actual output due to issues in the key type checking and handling logic.

### Identified Issues:
1. The logic for handling different types of `key` inputs is inconsistent.
2. The key type inference might not be accurate, leading to incorrect branching in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent treatment of different key types and inaccurate key type inference within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the function does not properly handle cases where the key is a list or np.ndarray.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of key types.
2. Improve key type inference to correctly identify the type of key being passed.
3. Implement logic that treats list-like keys in a similar manner to other array-like keys.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the identified issues and expected input/output values:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently with other array-like keys, addressing the issues identified above and aligning with the expected input/output values provided in the cases.
