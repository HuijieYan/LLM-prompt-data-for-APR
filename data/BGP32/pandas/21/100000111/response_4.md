### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys provided when accessing elements in a Series. However, there are inconsistencies in the handling of different types of keys, especially when it comes to lists. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and the unexpected behavior when using `ser[list(key)]`.

### Identified Issues:
1. In the current implementation, the function does not correctly handle list-like keys containing no matches.
2. The function does not handle the `key` parameter appropriately based on its type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of keys. When using `ser[list(key)]`, it results in a traceback as the function does not account for this specific case, leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent and correct handling of all types of keys passed to the function. Specifically, we need to address the case of list-like keys that contain no matches.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if len(key) == 0:  # Handling list-like keys with no matches
            return self.reindex([])  # Return empty Series when no matches found
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added an explicit check for instances when `key` is a list, numpy array, extension array, Series, or Index.
2. Added a condition to handle cases where `key` is an empty list, returning an empty Series to address the case of no matches found within the list.
3. Ensured consistent handling of all types of `key` parameters to prevent unexpected behaviors.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys containing no matches appropriately and provide the expected outputs according to the specified test cases.
