### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object in pandas. However, there are inconsistencies and potential bugs in how it handles different types of input, specifically when dealing with list indexers. The issue seems to stem from not handling list-like indexers correctly and differentiating between various indexer types.

### Identifying potential error locations:
1. The function does not differentiate between list-like indexers and other types properly.
2. The handling of different indexer types is not consistent throughout the function.
3. The conversion of key to a list in `key = list(key)` might introduce unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from inconsistencies in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers. Due to the mismatch in handling list-like indexers, the function fails to return the expected outputs for certain cases, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper differentiation between list indexers and other types of indexers.
2. Update the logic to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types.
3. Avoid unnecessary conversions that might alter the behavior of the function.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function improves the handling of different types of indexers, especially list-like indexers. By checking for scalar values separately and ensuring consistent treatment of various indexer types, the function should now provide the expected output for all the test cases mentioned.
