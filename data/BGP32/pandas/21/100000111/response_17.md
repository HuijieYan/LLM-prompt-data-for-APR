### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, but it has some issues that lead to incorrect behavior. Specifically, when dealing with a key that is a list-like object, it fails to handle it properly. The GitHub issue further points out a specific inconsistency with how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers.

### Error Locations:
1. The function fails to properly handle list-like keys.
2. The conditional checks and type handling are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the function not properly differentiating between different types of indexers when handling keys. This leads to inconsistencies in behavior when using list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers. The error occurs because the function does not correctly handle the case of a key being a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys, respects the different types of indexers, and maintains consistency in behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):  # Removed ExtensionArray, Series
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handling list-like keys separately to maintain consistency
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the needed modifications, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys correctly and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
