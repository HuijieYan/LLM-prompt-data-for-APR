### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. However, there are inconsistencies in how it handles array-like indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list compared to other types like ndarray or Index. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when trying to index a Series using a list key.

### Identified Errors:
1. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistencies with other indexers.
2. The function incorrectly identifies the type of key in some cases.
3. The function does not differentiate between different types of indexers effectively.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers within the function. This causes unexpected errors while trying to index a Series using a list key, making the function behavior inconsistent.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all array-like indexers are treated consistently and handle list indexers appropriately within the function. We should adjust the logic based on the expected behavior and ensure that the function returns the correct values for all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is a list-like object
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Treat list key differently to handle inconsistencies
        if not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like objects correctly and ensuring consistency in dealing with different array-like indexers, the corrected function should now fulfill the expected input/output values and resolve the issue mentioned on GitHub.
