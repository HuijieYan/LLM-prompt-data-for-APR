### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there are potential issues with how it handles the key types, specifically when dealing with lists. The function checks for various types of key inputs like slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, etc. But it fails to appropriately handle the case when the key is a list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of key as a list.
2. Inconsistent type checks and actions based on the key type.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current function arises due to the inconsistency in handling key indexers, particularly when the key is a list. The provided function does not correctly handle list-like key objects, which leads to unexpected behavior in the function's execution. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, the behavior for list indexers is different from other types, causing a KeyError in certain cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to consistently handle list-like key indexers for a Series object. It should ensure that all types of key indexers are processed correctly to avoid unexpected errors. By modifying the key type checks and actions based on the types of keys, we can ensure a more robust and consistent behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[list(key)]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys in the function, we can ensure that all the expected input/output cases are correctly addressed, and the issue reported in GitHub is resolved. This corrected version will provide consistent behavior for different types of key indexers for a Series object.
