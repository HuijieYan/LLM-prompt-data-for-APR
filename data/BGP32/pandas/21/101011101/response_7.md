### Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how different types of `key` inputs are handled. Based on the error message and the provided runtime values, it appears that when the input `key` is a list-like object, the function is not handling it correctly, leading to a `KeyError` in the test cases.

- In Case 1, the `key` is a list `['C']`.
- In Case 2, the `key` is an ndarray containing `['C']`.
- In Case 3, the `key` is an Index object with values `['C']`.
- In Case 4, the `key` is a Series object with a single value of `'C'`.

The function needs to handle list-like input keys correctly to avoid the `KeyError` in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We can modify the logic to treat list-like keys appropriately for Series indexing. Specifically, we need to ensure that when the input key is a list, it is correctly processed to avoid the `KeyError`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list-like keys correctly in the updated `_get_with` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases.
