### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect identification of the key type, leading to an incorrect path of execution.
3. The key type is inferred using `lib.infer_dtype`, which seems to be incorrectly identifying the key type as "string" in all cases, causing the function to always return `self.loc[key]`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified.
5. By revising the type identification logic and incorporating the correct handling based on the key type, we can correct the function.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        # Correctly infer the type of the key
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic for correctly inferring the key type and handling different types of keys accordingly, the bug in the `_get_with` function should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values.
