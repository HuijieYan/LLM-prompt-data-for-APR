### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of various key types, leading to an unexpected behavior when indexing a Series. The issue can be identified in the block of code where the key type is checked and processed.

In the buggy function:
1. If the key is not recognized as a list-like object, a direct `loc` operation is performed on the key.
2. If the key is a list-like object and not an integer, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, it is converted to a list.
3. Based on the inferred key type and the fallback logic, the indexing operation is executed either with `loc` or `iloc`.

However, the current implementation fails to correctly process all types of keys, especially when dealing with different classes (like Index, Series). This leads to KeyError exceptions during the tests because the indexing operation does not handle these scenarios properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function and handle various keys correctly, we need to:
1. Ensure that we handle Index and Series types appropriately.
2. Implement a more robust logic to determine the key type and choose the indexing operation accordingly.
3. Perform the indexing operation considering all possible key types.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):  # Check if the key is a scalar value
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif key_type in ['boolean', 'string']:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles different key types more robustly and should pass the failing tests by addressing the key error issues.
