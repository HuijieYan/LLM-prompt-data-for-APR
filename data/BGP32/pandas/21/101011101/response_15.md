### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_get_with`, there seems to be an issue with the logic related to handling the `key` input. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases, which leads to incorrect indexing behavior and causes the failing tests.

The problematic part of the code is the section where the `key_type` is determined based on the input `key`. The function mistakenly infers the key type as `'string'` regardless of the actual type of `key`, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and thus the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly determine the type of the `key` input and adjust the indexing behavior accordingly. We need to ensure that the `key_type` is accurately inferred based on the type of the `key` input.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "bool":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the key type inference logic and including proper handling for different key types (especially 'bool' and 'integer'), the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and behave as expected in various scenarios.
