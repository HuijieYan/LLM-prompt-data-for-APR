### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is called with a key that is supposed to trigger a `KeyError`, but the function does not raise the error as expected. Instead, it proceeds to handle the key incorrectly, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

The issue arises in the part of the code where the type of the key is being checked. The key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all test cases, which is not correct since the keys are supposed to be lists, ndarrays, Indexes, or Series. This incorrect inference of the key type prevents the function from executing the correct logic for handling the key and raising the expected `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled within the function. We should modify the logic where the key type is inferred and apply appropriate checks based on the actual type of the key to trigger the `KeyError` when necessary.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly identify the type of the key and handle it accordingly, raising a `KeyError` when necessary. This correction should resolve the failing tests and ensure the expected behavior.
