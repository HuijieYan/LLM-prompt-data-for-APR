### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys and fetch corresponding values from the `Series`. The failing tests indicate that the function is not handling certain input types correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` that should not happen.

From the failing tests, we can see that the `key` parameter takes different forms such as a list, an ndarray, and an Index. The function is supposed to identify the type of the key and return the appropriate value from the `Series`. However, the current implementation is not handling all cases correctly, leading to the error.

### Bugs in the function:
1. The function doesn't handle Index objects correctly, resulting in a KeyError.
2. The determination of the `key_type` is not accurate, causing incorrect behavior.
3. The logic for selecting the appropriate indexing method (`iloc` or `loc`) based on `key_type` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Fixing the bugs:
1. Correct the handling of Index objects by ensuring they are properly processed.
2. Fix the determination of `key_type` to accurately identify the type of the key.
3. Revise the logic for selecting the indexing method based on the `key_type` to ensure the correct method (`iloc` or `loc`) is used.

### Updated corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle different types of keys
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Raise an error if key is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Handle tuples with multiple keys
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle scalar keys
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list if it's not one of the allowed types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Infer the type of key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle integer keys
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle duplicate indexing case
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the corrections outlined above, the fixed version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle various types of keys and return the values from the `Series` without causing KeyErrors.
