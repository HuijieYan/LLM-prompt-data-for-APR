### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of the `key` parameter, specifically when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function tries to infer the type of `key` and decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer (`iloc`) or label-based indexer (`loc`). The bug seems to be in the logic related to handling the case when `key` is a list or ndarray.

The error messages suggest that a `KeyError` is expected when trying to access an element that is not present in the index. However, the current implementation is not raising the expected `KeyError`, leading to test failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series and raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index. The function should also respect the expected behavior based on the type of `key`.

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = "index"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that the function raises a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index and correctly handles the type of the key.
