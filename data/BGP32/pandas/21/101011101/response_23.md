### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The bug seems to be related to the detection and handling of the key types, leading to incorrect behavior when indexing with certain types like lists, NumPy arrays, Series objects, or Index objects. 

### Issues
1. The condition for checking if the key is an instance of `Index` is flawed as `Index` objects are being treated separately from other list-like objects.
2. The conversion to a list for the key is causing unexpected behavior and type inconsistencies.
3. The conditional checks for different key types may not cover all cases properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Refactor the logic to handle different key types uniformly.
2. Update the checks for key types to cover all possible variations.
3. Ensure that the key conversion to a list is done correctly.
4. Ensure that the key types are correctly detected and handled with respect to positional and label-based indexing.

### Bug-fixed Function
Here is the bug-fixed version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is converted to an Index object
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the issues identified and pass the failing test cases by handling different key types properly.
