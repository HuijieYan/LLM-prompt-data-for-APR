### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the conditional check for the `key_type` variable in the `_get_with` function. The buggy function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'integer'` due to a discrepancy in type inference when dealing with different types of keys, which leads to the incorrect path being taken in the function.

In the failing cases provided, the `key` being passed to the function is of type string or object, but the function incorrectly infers the type as `'integer'`, causing the incorrect return path to be executed. This results in a `KeyError` being raised during the test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to improve the type inference logic for the `key` variable inside the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that the correct type is inferred for the `key` before determining the path of execution in the function.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the correct type inference logic and ensuring the `key_type` is accurately identified, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the different types of keys passed to it, resolving the `KeyError` raised during the tests.
