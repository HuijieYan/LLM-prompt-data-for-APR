### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input `key` (slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc.) and return the corresponding values accordingly.
2. The bug seems to stem from the handling of input keys that are arrays, Series, or Index objects.
3. The error message indicates that there is an issue when indexing with a key that is either a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
4. The bug occurs when determining the `key_type` and deciding whether to use `loc` or `iloc` for indexing based on the type of `key`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of `key`. Specifically, when `key` is an array, Series, or Index object, we should use the `loc` method for indexing. If `key` is a list, we should also use the `loc` method to handle the case correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in {"integer", "string"}:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle indexing with keys that are arrays, Series, Index objects, or lists.
