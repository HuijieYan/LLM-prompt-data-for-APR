### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object. The function incorrectly processes the `key` based on its type, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

1. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 4, the `key` parameter is being converted to a list type, but the subsequent logic to handle different key types is flawed, resulting in an incorrect `key_type` inference.
   
2. The function should correctly distinguish between different key types such as lists, arrays, Series, and Index objects to handle them appropriately.
   
3. The 'string' value inferred for `key_type` indicates that the logic for determining the key type is failing to recognize the actual type of the key parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to improve the logic for handling different types of `key` inputs. By correctly identifying the key type and processing it accordingly, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By properly handling list-like objects and ensuring the correct type inference for the `key` parameter, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and behave as expected based on the provided input/output values and types.
