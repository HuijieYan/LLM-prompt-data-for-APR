The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type. The function assumes that all keys that are not list-like should be treated as label-based and accessed using `self.loc`, which is causing the issue. The key type is being incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, leading to the wrong execution path.

To fix this bug, we need to improve the type inference logic and correctly distinguish between different types of keys. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_bool(key):
        # boolean indexing
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_integer(key):
        # integer indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version includes checks for boolean indexing, integer indexing, and list-like keys to handle different scenarios correctly. The `is_bool` and `is_integer` functions are used to determine the type of keys accurately.
