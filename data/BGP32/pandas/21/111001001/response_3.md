The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect identification of the `key_type` when a list-like key is provided. This leads to the function taking a wrong path and returning the wrong result.

The key issue is that in the buggy function, the code assumes that if the key type is 'integer', it should decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer or a label-based indexer. However, when dealing with a list-like key, the code incorrectly infers the `key_type` as 'integer' when it should be checking if the key is label-based and then fallback to positional indexing if required.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the `key_type` when dealing with a list-like key to correctly handle the label-based indexing as needed. We can accomplish this by checking if the key is an index or an array before inferring the type and determining the appropriate action.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle list-like key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version specifically addresses the misclassification of key types and adjusts the logic flow to handle list-like keys appropriately.
