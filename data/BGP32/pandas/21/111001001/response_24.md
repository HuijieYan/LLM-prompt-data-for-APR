The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the misinterpretation of the key_type variable, which is incorrectly identified as a string in all cases. This issue occurs because the key_type calculation does not accurately reflect the type of key being passed to the function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the key_type calculation to properly determine the type of key being used for indexing within the Series object. The key_type should reflect the actual type of the key. Based on the provided values and types of the variables at the function's return in the failing test cases, we can infer that the key is not being correctly identified.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            key_type = 'integer' if key.dtype == np.int_ else 'object'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key_type calculation has been updated to accurately determine the type of the key being used for indexing, resolving the bug related to incorrect key_type identification. This fix should address the issues observed in the failing test cases and improve the functionality of the `_get_with` function.
