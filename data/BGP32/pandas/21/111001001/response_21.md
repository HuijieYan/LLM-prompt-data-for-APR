### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where the key is a list-like object containing a string. The function incorrectly tries to infer the data type of the key, which results in `'string'` as the `key_type`. This leads to the function attempting to access the key as an index, causing a KeyError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object containing a string differently. We can modify the function to directly check if the key is a list-like object containing strings and then proceed accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like objects containing a string
    if is_list_like(key) and any(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific check for list-like objects containing strings, we can address the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly in all cases.
