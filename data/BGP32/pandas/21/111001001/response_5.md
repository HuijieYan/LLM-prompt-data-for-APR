## Bug analysis:
Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue seems to be related to how the function handles different types of keys for indexing the Series. The function is supposed to return the values based on the input key, but the key_type determination seems to be incorrect based on the input provided.

### Observations:
1. In Cases 1, 2, and 3, the key value is a list, ndarray, and Index object, respectively, containing the value 'C'. However, the key_type is incorrectly determined as 'string' in all cases.
2. In Case 4, the key value is a Series object containing the value 'C', but the key_type is still incorrectly determined as 'string'.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect inference of the key_type based on the type of input key provided. The function fails to correctly identify the type of key, leading to the wrong path in the conditional statements and ultimately an incorrect return value.

## Bug fix:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the key_type based on the type of key provided. Since the goal is to correctly identify the type of key for appropriate indexing, we should update the logic to handle different key types more accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the logic for determining the key_type has been updated to consider a scalar key separately and handle different key types more accurately. This should fix the bug and correctly return the values based on the input key provided in each case.
