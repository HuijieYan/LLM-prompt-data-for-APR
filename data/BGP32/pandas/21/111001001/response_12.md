The bug in the function `_get_with` stems from the incorrect handling of different data types for `key` input. The function fails to properly identify the key type in various scenarios, causing it to return incorrect results.

Based on the provided runtime cases, we can observe that the `key_type` variable is incorrectly assigned the value `'string'` in all cases. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key`. This leads to the function taking incorrect paths and returning unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic for determining the type of `key`. We should update the logic to properly identify different data types such as lists, arrays, scalars, etc., and handle them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        return np.nan
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the above corrected version, we added a check for scalar keys that are not in the index, handling them by returning `np.nan`. We revised the logic to correctly handle different types of keys like lists, arrays, scalars, and Index. This should address the bug and provide the expected behavior for different key types.
