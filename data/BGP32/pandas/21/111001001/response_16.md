The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` variable. The function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing the Series object, but there is a mistake in determining the `key_type`, which leads to the wrong action being taken.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables, we can see that in all cases the `key` variable is being incorrectly classified as a string due to the logic used to determine the `key_type`. This then leads to the incorrect branch being taken in the conditional statements of the function.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the actual type of the `key`. We can use Python's `isinstance()` function to check the type of the `key` variable and then set the `key_type` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `isinstance()` to check the type of the `key` variable, we ensure that the `key_type` is determined correctly, and the function branches are executed as intended based on the type of indexing being performed.
