### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` receives a `key` input and processes it to determine the appropriate operation to perform. The issue lies in the logic for handling different types of keys and determining `key_type`. The function then makes decisions based on this `key_type`, which seems to incorrectly infer the type in some cases.

### Bug Explanation
- In all provided test cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, even when the keys are lists or arrays.
- This incorrect inference leads to the function taking the wrong path in deciding whether to treat the key as a label-based or positional indexer.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of key provided. The logic should accurately detect whether the key is an integer, boolean, list, array, etc., and set the `key_type` accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = [key]
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key_type` is inferred correctly based on the type of the key provided, ensuring that decisions within the function are made accurately.
