The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the condition where it checks for the key type and tries to infer the type using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. In the provided cases, the key is always a list, but the inference mechanism sometimes incorrectly labels it as "string" due to the way inference happens in the function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the inference logic and handle list-like keys appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    # Skip the inference if the key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly handling list-like keys without inferring the type, we avoid the misclassification of the key type as "string" and resolve the bug. This correction ensures that the correct path is followed based on the actual type of the key provided.

Please replace the existing `_get_with` function with this corrected version in the `Series` class to resolve the bug.
