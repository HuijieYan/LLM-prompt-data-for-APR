The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect determination of the `key_type` leading to inappropriate handling of the key value. The function fails to correctly identify the type of the key, leading to unexpected behavior. Based on the runtime input/output values, we can observe that the key is not being identified correctly as a string, causing the function to return without correctly processing the key.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified before deciding how to handle it. We should check the type of the `key` parameter and handle it accordingly. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ('integer', 'mixed-integer-bool'):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly identified using `lib.infer_dtype` and handles it appropriately based on the type. Now, the function should work correctly and handle various types of keys without errors.
