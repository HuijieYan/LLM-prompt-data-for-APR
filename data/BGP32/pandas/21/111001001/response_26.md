The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect checking of the input `key` type and handling of different types. The function expects the `key` to be list-like, but the type checking and handling currently have multiple issues.

The bug causes issues when the input `key` is not processed correctly based on its type, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially raising errors.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the type checking and handling logic in the function to ensure that different types of `key` inputs are processed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to list in case it's not one
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks if the `key` is not list-like and converts it to a list when needed, ensuring that different types of inputs are handled appropriately.
