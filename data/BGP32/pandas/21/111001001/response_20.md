The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of different types of `key` input in the `_get_with` function. The function tries to determine the type of `key` and based on that, it performs different actions. However, in the provided cases, the function incorrectly determines the `key_type` as `'string'` instead of the expected types.

To fix the bug, we should adjust how the function determines the type of `key` and handle different cases accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        # Handle lists and numpy arrays
        key_type = 'list_like'
    elif isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        # Handle Series and Index types
        key_type = 'series_index'
    else:
        # Default to treating as a scalar
        key_type = 'scalar'
    
    # Based on the determined key_type, perform the corresponding action
    if key_type == 'series_index':
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Default handling
        return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly determines the type of `key` and processes it accordingly based on its type. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to handle different input types correctly.
