The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect type inference for the variable `key_type`. The function uses this inferred type to decide how to index the Series (`self`) either by label or position. 

From the provided runtime cases, we see that regardless of the input type (list, ndarray, etc.), the inferred type `key_type` is always `'string'`. This indicates that the type inference logic inside the function is incorrectly identifying the type of the `key`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for inferring the type of `key`. One potential strategy is to check the type of `key` directly instead of relying solely on the inferred type. We can adjust the logic to differentiate between different types of inputs and handle them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version directly checks if `key` is a scalar and indexes using `loc` for scalars. For other types of `key`, it accurately infers the type and handles indexing based on the type. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave correctly based on the type of `key` provided.
