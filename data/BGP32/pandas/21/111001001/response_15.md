## Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of `key` inputs. The function checks the type of `key` and performs different actions based on the type. However, the bug occurs when the type of `key` is a list of strings, and the function incorrectly handles it as a single string leading to the `key_type` being inferred as a string instead of an integer.

## Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the `key` parameter is a list `['C']`, which should be treated as a list of labels to index the Series. However, due to the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):`, the function incorrectly returns `self.loc[key]` treating `'C'` as a label, leading to the incorrect inference of `key_type` as a string.

2. Similarly, in Case 2, the `key` parameter is an ndarray `array(['C'], dtype=object)`, and in Case 3, it is an Index `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`. However, the function fails to handle these inputs correctly and infers `key_type` as a string instead of an integer.

3. In Case 4, when `key` is a Series `0    C`, the function again incorrectly returns `self.loc[key]`, causing the inference of `key_type` as a string.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of lists of labels. We should ensure that when `key` is a list-like object, we treat it as a list of labels to correctly index the Series. It is important to distinguish between single labels and lists of labels.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Ensure key is treated as a list of labels

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly converting `key` to a list when it is a list-like input, we ensure that it is treated as a list of labels for indexing, fixing the bug in handling list-like inputs in the `_get_with` function.
