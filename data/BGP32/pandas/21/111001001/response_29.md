The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to incorrect handling of the key types, specifically when the key is not recognized as a list-like object. The function fails to correctly process the given key if it's neither a slice, a tuple, nor a DataFrame, leading to an error in identifying the key type.

Based on the provided cases where the bug occurs, it is evident that the function is not properly handling the case when the key is a scalar object. As a result, the function attempts to locate the scalar key using `self.loc[key]`, which does not work as intended.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checking for scalar keys and direct the function to the correct handling method. A possible strategy is to first check if the key is a scalar before any other checks, and if it is, handle it appropriately to avoid errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_scalar(key):  # Check if key is a scalar
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle scalar key using loc
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Remaining code from the original function
    ...
```

This modification ensures that scalar keys are correctly handled by using `self.loc[key]` to access the specific value in the Series. By incorporating this fix, the function should now handle scalar keys without errors.
