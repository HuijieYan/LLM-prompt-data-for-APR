The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the check for the type of `key` and the subsequent handling based on its type. The bug arises because the handling of the key types is not comprehensive and is not based on the actual data type of the `key`.

### Issue:
The `key` is not being correctly processed and handled based on its type. The function needs to be modified to properly account for different types of `key` inputs.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the actual data type of the `key`.
2. Update the conditional statements to handle different data types of `key` appropriately.
3. Ensure that all possible types of `key` are considered and handled correctly.

### Fixed version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the function will now properly handle different types of `key` inputs and avoid the bug that was present in the original implementation.
