### Bug analysis
Based on the runtime values and types provided for the buggy function in each case, we can identify the following issues:
1. The `key` parameter is not consistently recognized as a list and is sometimes incorrectly identified as an ndarray, Index, or Series.
2. The `key_type` variable is derived incorrectly as a string in all cases, which indicates an issue with inferring the type of the key.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the type of the `key` parameter is correctly identified as a list before processing it further. Additionally, we need to properly infer the type of the `key` to determine the appropriate indexing method.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the check for `is_list_like` and inferring the `key_type` correctly based on the type of `key`, the corrected function should now handle the different input cases accurately and avoid the bugs encountered previously.
