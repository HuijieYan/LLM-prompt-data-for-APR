### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle key-based access to a `Series` object based on different types of keys passed to it. The bug seems to be related to the handling of certain key types, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` involves passing a key (of type `Series`) that does not match any values in the original `Series`. The bug seems to occur when the key type is converted to a different type within the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to improper handling of key types within the `_get_with` function. When converting the key to a different type, it loses its original context and does not match any values in the `Series`, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, ensure that the key type is properly handled without losing its context. When converting it to a different type, ensure that the conversion maintains the original context of the key to prevent a `KeyError`. Additionally, the conditions for handling different key types may need to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Ensure the given key is an Index
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    # Retrieve the inferred key type
    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # All other types of keys
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the key is correctly converted to an `Index` if needed and maintaining its context while handling different key types, the corrected function should not raise a `KeyError` when accessed with a key that does not match any values in the `Series`.
