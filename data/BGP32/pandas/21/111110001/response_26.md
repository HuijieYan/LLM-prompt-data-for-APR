### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The failing test is trying to access a key that does not exist in the `Series` index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The bug lies in the logic of handling non-list-like keys. The function performs certain operations based on the type of key, and it is not handling all possible types correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that non-list-like keys are properly handled according to the expected behavior of indexing a `Series`.
  
### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated handling of non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Series):  # Handling Series key
            key = key.values  # Use values of the Series
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, Index):  # Handling Index key
            key = key.values
            return self.loc[key]
        else:  # Handling scalar key
            return self.loc[key]
                
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to properly handle keys that are instances of `Series` or `Index`, we can ensure that the correct behavior is maintained for different types of keys. This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
