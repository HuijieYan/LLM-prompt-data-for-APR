### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
- The function is used to get values from a `Series` based on the provided key. It handles different types of keys, such as slices, tuples, lists, etc.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access values from a `Series` using a key that does not exist in the `Series`, which should raise a `KeyError`.
- The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected.
- The issue seems to be related to how the function handles indexing with keys that do not exist in the `Series`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when the key does not exist in the `Series` index.
- The function `_get_with` does not properly handle the case where the key is not found in the index, leading to the absence of a `KeyError` being raised.
- The incorrect handling of keys that do not exist in the index is causing the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to ensure that the function properly raises a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the `Series` index.
- The fix should modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case where the key is not present in the index and raise a `KeyError` in such scenarios.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Check if key exists in the index, if not raise KeyError
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    # check if key is iterable and handle accordingly
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correctly handling the case where the key does not exist in the index and raising a `KeyError`, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test.
