## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
2. The function checks the type of `key` and performs actions based on its type, like returning a sliced series, raise an error if key is a DataFrame or if it is a tuple, or call other internal methods.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` to be raised when indexing a `Series` with a key that does not exist in the index. The test passes different types of keys (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to the `ser` Series to cause the error. The error occurs because the `_get_with` function does not handle certain key types properly, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle all the different types of keys that could be passed to it.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_with` function below.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle keys that do not exist in the index, preventing the `KeyError` from occurring during the test.
