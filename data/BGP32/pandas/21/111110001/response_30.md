### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys used to index a Series, but there is a logical error in the section where it checks if the key is list-like. This logic is causing the KeyErrors in the failing test cases.

The bug arises due to the wrong assumption in the code that `key` should always be turned into a list. This assumption leads to errors when the key is already list-like but is not recognized as such due to conditions that expect it to be a single element.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly handle the case where `key` is already a list-like object. We can do this by explicitly checking for this condition before proceeding with the logic that converts `key` into a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fixed version explicitly checks with `is_list_like(key)` if `key` is already list-like, and it only converts it to a list if it's not list-like.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of keys and pass the failing test cases.
