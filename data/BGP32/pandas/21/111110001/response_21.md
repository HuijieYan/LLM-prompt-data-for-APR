## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing series data. The error is occurring when indexing the series using a key that does not exist in the series index. The failing test is trying to access an element that does not exist in the index of the series, which should raise a `KeyError`. However, due to a bug in the `_get_with` function, the KeyError is not being raised as expected.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring in the block of code that checks if the key type is not recognized as a list-like structure, and then tries to resolve it using the `loc` method. Since the key that is being selected does not exist in the index, it should result in a KeyError, but this is not happening.

## Bug Cause
The bug might be caused by the incorrect handling of key types in `_get_with` function. The way the function tries to convert multiple types of keys to positional or label-based indexers might be causing the KeyError to not be raised when it should.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the key is not found in the index, a KeyError should be raised. This can be done by handling the different types of keys in a way that correctly identifies if the key is invalid and raises a KeyError accordingly.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling key types that are not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

    # Handling complex key types
    key_arr = np.asarray(key)
    if len(set(map(type, key_arr))) != 1 and len(np.unique(key_arr)) != len(key_arr):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix ensures that if a key is not found in the index, a KeyError will be explicitly raised. By correcting the logic flow, we can now handle the key types correctly and raise an error when necessary.
