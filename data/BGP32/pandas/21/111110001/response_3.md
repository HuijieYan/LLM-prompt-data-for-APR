### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to return specific values based on the type of key provided. However, the bug is causing it to raise a `TypeError` instead of handling the key type correctly.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of accessing a key that does not exist in the series, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised. The buggy function is failing to handle this scenario correctly, resulting in a failure of the test.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the condition where it checks if `key` is not list-like. If `key` is not list-like, it should attempt to access the key using `self.loc[key]`, but instead, it is raising a `TypeError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where it checks if `key` is not list-like to handle the scenario where a key not existing in the series is accessed. We should replace the `return self.loc[key]` line with a `try-except` block to catch the `KeyError` and then properly raise it.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
            
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By replacing `return self.loc[key]` with a try-except block, the corrected function now properly handles cases where the key does not exist in the index and raises a `KeyError` as expected. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
