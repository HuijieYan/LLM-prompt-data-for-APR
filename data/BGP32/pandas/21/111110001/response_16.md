### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is attempting to extract values using a key.
- The failing test is trying to access a value from a Series using a key that does not exist in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.
- In the failing test, the key box is one of `[list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series]`. The `pd.Series` object is used in the test that is expected to raise a `KeyError`.
- The `box` parameter in the failing test is a `pd.Series` object, and when using a key `key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)` it is not contained in the index of the Series.
- The failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access a key that is not present in the Series index.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of the key that is not present in the index of the Series. It should raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found.
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the given key is not present in the index and continues to execute without raising any errors or returning the appropriate result.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index of the Series.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if all(k in self.index for k in key):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By modifying this function to correctly raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
