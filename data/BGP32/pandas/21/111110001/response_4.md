The buggy function `_get_with` is failing when a Series object is used as the key. The buggy function only handles `list`, `numpy.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, and `Index` types. When a Series object is passed as the key, it does not match any of these types, and as a result, it falls back to calling `self.reindex(key)` which raises a `KeyError` in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check to handle the case when the key is a Series object. We can convert the Series object into a list and then proceed with the logic as if it was a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.tolist()

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version first checks if the key is a Series and converts it to a list using the `tolist()` method. This modification will ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle Series objects as keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
