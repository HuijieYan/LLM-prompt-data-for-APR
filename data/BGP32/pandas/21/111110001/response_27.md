### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is designed to retrieve elements from a Series based on the provided key. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when trying to access an item that does not exist in the Series.

The error message from the failing test indicates that the `KeyError` exception was not raised, which means that the buggy function `_get_with` is not handling missing keys properly.

### Bug in the `_get_with` function

The bug is occurring in the `_get_with` function due to the handling of non-existing keys. In the case where a key is provided that does not exist in the Series, the function is not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an invalid key is provided, the function should raise a `KeyError` just like in the failing test.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            if len(self) == 0:  # Handle empty Series
                raise KeyError("Empty Series")
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if len(self) == 0:  # Handle empty Series
            raise KeyError("Empty Series")
        return self.loc[key]

    if len(self) == 0:  # Handle empty Series
        raise KeyError("Empty Series")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles the case of missing keys by raising a `KeyError`. This fix will ensure that when trying to access elements from a Series with a key that does not exist, the expected exception is raised.
