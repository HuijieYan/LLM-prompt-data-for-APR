### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the Pandas library is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc. The bug occurs when attempting to index a Series with specific types that weren't handled correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug could potentially arise in the following conditions:
1. When a DataFrame is passed as the key, the function raises a `TypeError`.
2. When an object that is not list-like and also not recognized as a scalar is passed (e.g., a tuple), the function is supposed to fall back to positional indexing using `self.loc[key]`, but this might not work as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect type checking and handling of certain input key types in the `_get_with` function. When a DataFrame or certain non-list-like keys are provided, the function doesn't handle those cases properly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle DataFrames appropriately, suggesting to utilize the appropriate DataFrame column for indexing.
2. For non-list-like, non-scalar keys (such as tuples), ensure that the position-based indexing (`self.loc[key]`) is used correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.to_list()  # Ensure key is a list for consistency
    
    # Infer the dtype of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Determine whether to use positional or label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Applying these changes should address the bugs in the `_get_with` function, helping it handle different types of keys for indexing a Pandas Series correctly. This fix should also make the function pass the failing tests provided.
