### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to index a Series object using another object `key`. It tries to handle different cases for indexing, such as slice, tuple, DataFrame, list, np.ndarray, etc. The issue arises when the input `key` is of type Series, and the function fails to handle this case correctly, raising a TypeError exception.

The failing test is trying to test this exact scenario, where it creates a Series object `key` with a single item "C" and then passes this Series object as the indexing key to `ser[key]`, where `ser` is another Series object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the buggy function encounters a Series object as the key for indexing. The function does not have a proper condition to handle this type of key, leading to a TypeError exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The fix involves adding a condition to handle the case when the key is of type `Series`. In this case, we can convert the Series object `key` to a list before proceeding with further operations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert Series to list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check `if isinstance(key, pd.Series): key = key.tolist()`, we ensure that when the key is a Series object, it is converted to a list before further processing. This correction should fix the bug and make the function work correctly with a Series object key.
