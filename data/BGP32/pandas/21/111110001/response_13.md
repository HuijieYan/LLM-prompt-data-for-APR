## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`.
2. The function is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
3. The failing tests are trying to index a `Series` with a key that does not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError`.
4. The error occurs because the function lacks handling for the case when key is an iterable (e.g., np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) that contains values not present in the index.
5. The bug can be fixed by explicitly checking if all elements of the key are in the index before indexing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the key is a list-like object containing values not present in the index.
2. If any value in the key is not in the index, raise a `KeyError`.
3. Modify the `_get_with` function to ensure that all elements of the key exist in the index before attempting to index.

## Bug Fix in `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like and contains all elements present in the index
    if is_list_like(key) and all(k in self.index for k in key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError("Not all elements in the key are in the index")
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle cases where the key contains elements not present in the index and raise a `KeyError` in such situations. This fix should make the test cases pass by raising the expected error when elements in the key are not found in the index.
