### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file contains a method `_get_with` that is responsible for handling different types of input keys and returning the appropriate values from the series.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior of indexing with a key that doesn't exist in the series, raising a `KeyError`.
3. The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not correctly handle non-existent keys when they are passed as a list or an ndarray.
4. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test case provides a key `"C"` that does not exist in the series, wrapped in a `pd.Series()`.
5. The bug causes the function to try indexing with the non-existent key, leading to the failure of the test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug occurs when trying to index with a non-existent key that is passed as a list or ndarray. We need to check if the key is present in the index before performing the indexing operation. If the key does not exist, we should raise a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check `if key not in self.index` before further operations, we ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when the key does not exist in the index. This change will prevent the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
