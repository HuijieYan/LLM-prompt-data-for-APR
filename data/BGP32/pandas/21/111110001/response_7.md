### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys passed to a Series and return the corresponding values.
- The failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior when a key that does not exist in the index is passed to the Series.
- The error message indicates that a `KeyError` was expected but not raised.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the `_get_with` function's handling of the key that does not exist in the Series index. When a key that is not present in the index is passed, it should raise a `KeyError` but instead returns the value resulting in the test failure.

### Fix:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that when a key is not found in the Series index, a `KeyError` is raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        if not self.index.isin(key).all():  # Check if all keys are present in the index
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index.")
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to raise `KeyError` if all the keys are not present in the index, we have fixed the bug in the `_get_with` function. After making this correction, the function should now pass the failing test.
