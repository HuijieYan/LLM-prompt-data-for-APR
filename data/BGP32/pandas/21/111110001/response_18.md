### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` takes a key as input and performs different operations based on the type of the key.
2. The failing test is trying to index a `Series` using an object of type `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.
3. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is expected but not raised, which suggests a problem with key indexing.
4. The bug occurs when trying to handle key types that are not recognized as list-like, resulting in incorrect indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug occurs when an object key is not list-like and is not recognized as a valid index type. We should handle this case appropriately to avoid the `KeyError`.
2. We can check for object keys that are not recognized as index types and treat them as scalars in the context of the `loc[]` indexer.
3. The bug fix involves modifying the `_get_with` function to address the key not recognized as list-like or another valid index type.

### Bug Fix - Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle case where key is not list-like and not recognized as an index type
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling scalar keys appropriately in the `loc[]` indexer, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test successfully.
