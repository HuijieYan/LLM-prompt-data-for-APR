### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is intended to test the behavior when a key that is not present in the index is used to access values from the Series object.
3. The failing test is raising a `KeyError` as the intended error message, but the actual behavior from the buggy function causes the test to fail because it does not raise the `KeyError`.
4. The bug is likely located in the last part of the function where different key types are being handled.
5. The bug lies in the case when a key is not list-like. If the key is not list-like, the current implementation tries to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]`. This is incorrect as it should throw a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.
6. The strategy to fix the bug is to handle the case when the key is not list-like separately and raise a `KeyError` in that scenario.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the bug in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version will now raise a `KeyError` when a key that is not present in the index is used to access values from a Series object, ensuring the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test.
