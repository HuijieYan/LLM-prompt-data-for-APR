### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` receives a `key` parameter and is supposed to handle different types of input keys to perform the appropriate operation. This function is part of the `Series` class, which is designed to handle one-dimensional data.
- The failing test cases indicate that when passing a key of type `list`, `numpy.array`, `Index`, or `Series`, the expected `KeyError` exception is not being raised.
- The error message in the failing test suggests that the condition where the specified key is not present in the index is not being handled correctly in the `_get_with` function.
- In Python, `KeyError` typically occurs when attempting to access a key or index that does not exist.
- The failing test is testing the behavior of the `Series` class when accessing a key that is not present in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the way the `_get_with` function handles the `key` parameter. It fails to properly handle cases where the key is not present in the index, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly handles cases where the specified key is not present in the index. When the key is not found in the index, it should raise a `KeyError` to indicate that the key is not present in the index.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should handle the failing test cases:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle cases where key is not present in the index
    if not key.isin(self.index).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, an additional check has been added to verify that all elements in the input key are present in the index. If any element is not in the index, a `KeyError` is raised with a message indicating that none of the keys are in the index. This change should address the issue with the failing test cases.
