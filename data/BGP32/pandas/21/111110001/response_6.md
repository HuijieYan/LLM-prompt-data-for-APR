## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to index a Series with different types of keys, such as slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple, and others.
2. The failing test is trying to index a Series with a key that is not present in the index, which should result in a KeyError, but the bug prevents this from happening.
3. The bug is likely in the logic where the key type is inferred and the final indexing operation is determined.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct type inference is done for the key and handle the indexing operation based on the key type.
5. Our correction should ensure that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is chosen based on the key type.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle key type inference and choose the indexing method
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    # Handle the case when key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle any other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By following the corrected implementation above, the bug should be fixed and the function `_get_with` should now correctly handle different types of keys for indexing. This correction should make the failing test pass.
