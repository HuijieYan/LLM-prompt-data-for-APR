### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. However, there are issues in the function logic that are causing the failing tests.

1. The function incorrectly identifies the type of the key as `'string'` when processing different types of input keys.
2. The function doesn't handle the case where the key is not found in the index properly, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test.

### Bug:
The bug in the function `_get_with` lies in the incorrect identification of the key type and the failure to properly handle the `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Correctly determine the key type based on the input key.
2. Handle the `KeyError` case properly by checking if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the updated `if` condition to check if the key is present in the index, we can handle the `KeyError` situation properly and ensure the function behaves correctly with different types of keys.
