The buggy function `_get_with` is failing because it doesn't handle the case where the `key` parameter is not a list-like object properly. Based on the failing tests and runtime values, we can see that when `key` is not list-like, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which leads to a `KeyError`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle non-list-like keys correctly. One approach is to wrap the key in a list before accessing `self.loc[key]` to ensure that the key is processed correctly by the `loc` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that even if `key` is not list-like, it will be wrapped in a list before accessing the `loc` function, preventing a `KeyError` from occurring.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing tests provided.
