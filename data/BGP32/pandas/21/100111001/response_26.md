### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the key in the case when it is not list-like. When the key is not list-like, the function tries to access the `self.loc[key]` value directly. However, this causes an issue if the key is not present in the Series index, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised in the test function.

### Solution Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to handle cases where the key is not list-like appropriately. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should first check if the key is present in the Series index. If it is not present, we should raise a `KeyError` to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the key is checked for existence in the Series index before trying to access it. This updated version should now pass the failing test cases.
