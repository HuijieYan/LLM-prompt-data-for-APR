Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function stems from incorrect handling of the key type when it is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. The function does not correctly handle cases where the key is of type list-like or array-like when trying to perform indexing.

The key issue arises when the key is converted to a list but is not handled properly in the subsequent logic, leading to incorrect behavior and causing the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that when the key is of type list, numpy array, Index, or Series, it is properly handled for indexing operations. We can modify the function to accurately deal with list-like and array-like keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to list if not already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of list-like and array-like keys, avoiding the issues that led to the failing tests. It converts the key to a list if needed and then proceeds with the indexing logic appropriately for different key types.
