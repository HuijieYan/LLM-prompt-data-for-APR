### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs for indexing a Series object. However, the bug is causing the function to misinterpret the `key_type` in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

1. In Case 1 and Case 2, the `key` input is a list and ndarray respectively containing a string value 'C'. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as 'string' instead of 'object'.

2. In Case 3, the `key` input is an Index object with a string value 'C', and the `inferred_type` is correctly identified as 'string'. However, this correct type identification is not utilized correctly in the function logic.

3. In Case 4, the `key` input is a Series object, but the function wrongly determines the `key_type` as 'string' instead of recognizing it as a different type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect identification and handling of the `key_type` in the function. This results in the function taking the wrong branch of logic based on the key type, leading to errors in indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified for different types of `key` inputs. Additionally, the logic branches based on the `key_type` need to be updated to handle the different key types accurately.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function after addressing the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return lib.is_string(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By properly handling the identification of the `key_type` and adjusting the logic branches accordingly, the corrected function should now correctly handle different types of `key` inputs for indexing a Series object.
