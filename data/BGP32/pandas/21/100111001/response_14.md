### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the function incorrectly infers the type of the key when it is not a list-like object. Due to this incorrect type inference, the function tries to access the key as if it was an integer (position-based) index, leading to a KeyError when the key is not found in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case where the key is not list-like but of type `Index` or `ndarray` while considering it as label-based index access. We can achieve this by explicitly checking for `Index` and `ndarray` instances before inferring the key type and then accessing the value using `self.loc[key]`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the index access for `Index` and `ndarray` instances, preventing the KeyError that was occurring in the failing tests.
