### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key provided is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series that contains values not present in the Series object's index. This leads to a KeyError being raised instead of properly handling the mismatch between the key and the index.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test, the key provided is not present in the Series index.
2. The buggy function checks the type of the key and infers its type as `'string'`.
3. Due to this incorrect type inference, the function fails to handle the situation properly and raises a KeyError instead of handling the mismatch between provided key values and the index values.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. We need to properly handle the case where the key values are not present in the Series index.
2. When the key values are not found in the index, we should raise a KeyError with a meaningful message indicating which values are not present.
3. We should handle input types like list, numpy array, Index, and Series correctly to account for differences in handling when keys are not present in the index.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        missing_values = key[~key.isin(self.index)]
        msg = f"None of {missing_values} are in the {self.index}"
        raise KeyError(msg)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying these corrections, the function should now properly handle cases where the key values are not present in the Series index and raise a KeyError with relevant information. This should allow the corrected function to pass the failing tests.
