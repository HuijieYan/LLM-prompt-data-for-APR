### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series. However, there is a bug when the key is not found in the Series index, resulting in a `KeyError` not being raised appropriately.

From the failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches`, it is clear that the expected behavior is for a `KeyError` to be raised when the key is not found in the index. The bug is likely related to how the function is handling keys that are not found in the Series index, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the key is not found in the Series index correctly. Instead of raising a `KeyError`, the function seems to improperly handle the missing key, likely due to the way it checks the key type and decides on whether to use `self.loc` or `self.iloc`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to properly handle the case where the key is not found in the Series index and raise a `KeyError` as expected. We can do this by checking if the key is in the Series index before proceeding with the indexing operation. If the key is not found, we can raise a `KeyError` with an appropriate message.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (bool, int, np.integer)):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            not_found = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
            raise KeyError(f"Keys {not_found} not found in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version improves the error handling for cases where the key is not found in the Series index and ensures that a `KeyError` is raised with the appropriate message.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
