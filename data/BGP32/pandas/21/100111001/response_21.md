### Bug Analysis:
In the `_get_with` function, the issue seems to be related to how the function handles the input `key` when it is a list-like object. The function tries to infer the type of `key` using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` and then proceeds based on the type it infers. However, in the failing test cases, the function fails to handle the situation where `key` is a list-like object with a single element.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test cases, `key` is a list-like object with a single element (e.g., `['C']` or `array(['C'], dtype=object)` or `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`).
- The function uses `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` to infer the type of `key`, which incorrectly infers the type as 'string'.
- Consequently, the function proceeds to treat `key` as a string, leading to a KeyError when trying to access a non-existent value in the Series index.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should handle list-like objects with a single element differently. We can modify the function to check if `key` is list-like with a single element and treat it accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like objects with a single element
    elif is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1:
        return self.loc[key[0]]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- This correction checks if `key` is list-like and has a single element before proceeding further.
- If `key` is a list-like object with a single element, the corrected function directly accesses that element using `self.loc[key[0]]`.
- This correction ensures that list-like objects with a single element are handled correctly, preventing the KeyError when accessing the Series index.

By applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle list-like objects with a single element, resolving the KeyError in the failing test cases.
