### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` contains a conditional block that attempts to handle different types of input keys. However, the issue arises when dealing with a specific type of input key (e.g., list, ndarray, Index, Series) that is not properly handled, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing tests.

In the failing test, the key used is `['C']` which is a list of strings representing the values to be extracted from the Series. The buggy function fails to correctly handle this list-like key, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to access non-existent indices.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` can correctly handle list-like keys (e.g., lists, ndarrays, Index, Series) by properly converting them to positional indices before indexing the Series. Specifically, we need to handle cases where the key type is not recognized and ensure that the correct indexing method (`.loc` or `.iloc`) is used based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_boolean(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
        return self._get_values(key)

    if is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that list-like keys are properly handled and converted to positional indices before accessing the Series values, resolving the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests.
