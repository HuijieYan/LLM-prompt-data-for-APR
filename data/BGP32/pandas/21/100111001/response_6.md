The issue in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic to determine the `key_type` when the input `key` is a list-like object. The current implementation incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases involving list-like inputs, which leads to the function taking the wrong path and encountering the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to correctly determine the `key_type` for list-like inputs. We should check if the input `key` is an instance of `list` or `np.ndarray` and handle each case accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now correctly handles list-like inputs by inferring the `key_type` based on the content of the input list or ndarray. This change ensures that the function takes the correct path when dealing with list-like inputs, resolving the KeyError that was encountered in the failing tests.
