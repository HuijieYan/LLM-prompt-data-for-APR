Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the key being recognized as a string when it should be treated as a positional indexer. Since the key is not recognized as a list-like type due to being a string, the function attempts to access it using `self.loc[key]`, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, we need to properly handle the case where the key is a single string and should be considered a positional indexer. We can modify the code to convert single keys to a list before proceeding with the indexing operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Handle single string key by converting it to a list
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle the case where the key is a single string, converting it to a list before proceeding with the indexing operation. This change should address the `KeyError` that was occurring in the failing tests.
