### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `_get_with`, the bug arises due to the way the function handles different types of `key` input. The function contains a condition that checks if `key` is not list-like, and if so, tries to access the location `self.loc[key]`. This logic is flawed as it assumes `key` can directly be used to index `self` without considering the actual type of `key`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic in the function to properly handle different types of `key`. Specifically, we should ensure that the code branches appropriately based on the type of `key` being provided and handle each case accordingly. We should avoid assuming that non-list-like keys can be directly used for indexing without further processing.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function appropriately handles the different types of `key` input and ensures that the indexing operation is performed correctly based on the type of `key`. This should resolve the bug and align the function's logic with the expected behavior.
