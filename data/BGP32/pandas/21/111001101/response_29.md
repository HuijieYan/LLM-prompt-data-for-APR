### Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of key types when determining how to retrieve values from the Series. The function fails to properly differentiate between different key types, leading to incorrect branching decisions.

1. Cases 1, 2, and 3 all pass a list-like key to the function, but the function mistakenly identifies the key type as `'string'`. This is incorrect and causes the function to return the wrong values.

2. The function does not handle different key types appropriately, leading to errors in processing the keys with incorrect assumptions about their types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the type of the key it receives and apply the appropriate logic based on the key type. This can be achieved by checking the key type explicitly and following the correct logic path for each key type.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for different key types
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now handle the different key types appropriately and make the correct decisions based on the type of the key passed to it.
