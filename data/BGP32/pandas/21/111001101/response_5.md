### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with the key type. In all cases, the key_type is incorrectly identified as a string, regardless of the actual type of the key. This leads to incorrect decisions being made based on the key type.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the key is a list, but the key_type is identified as a string.
2. In Case 2, the key is a numpy array, but the key_type is identified as a string.
3. In Case 3, the key is an Index object, and the inferred type is a string, but key_type is identified as a string.
4. In Case 4, the key is a Series object, but the key_type is identified as a string.

The bug stems from the incorrect inference of the key_type based on the key variable, leading to incorrect behavior in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the key_type based on the type of the key variable. We can use isinstance checks for various types of keys to determine the correct key_type. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected for different types of keys.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = "extension_array"
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = "index"
    else:
        key_type = "string"  # Default to string if type is not recognized

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "extension_array" or key_type == "index":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing these isinstance checks and setting the key_type accordingly, we ensure that the function behaves correctly for different types of keys as observed in the runtime cases.
