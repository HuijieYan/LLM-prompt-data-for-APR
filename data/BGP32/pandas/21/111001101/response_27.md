## Bug Explanation
The bug is occurring because the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, even though it should be inferred as `'object'` for the given input parameters. This incorrect inference leads to the wrong execution path being taken in the code.

In the provided cases, the input `key` is an object that should be considered as an element, but instead, it's being inferred as a `'string'`. This causes the function to take the wrong execution path and return an incorrect result.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of the input `key`. Since the input `key` can be different types such as a list, numpy array, Index, Series, etc., we need to adjust the inference logic to handle these cases properly.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "object":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version correctly infers the `key_type` based on the type of the input `key` and handles different cases accordingly. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected for the given input conditions.
