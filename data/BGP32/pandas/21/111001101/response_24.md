### Bug Explanation
In the provided buggy function `_get_with`, the issue arises when the `key` parameter is not recognized as a list-like object. The function attempts to retrieve the value corresponding to the `key` from the `Series` object. If the `key` is not recognized as list-like, the function should fall back to either `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]` depending on whether the index is label-based or positional.

However, the bug occurs when non-list-like objects are checked for whether they are integers or not. This check is done by inferring the type of the `key` using the function `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. If the inferred type is "integer", then the function should choose to treat the index operation as positional or label-based. The bug arises due to incorrect handling of non-integer types, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic of inferring the type of `key` is correct and handling non-integer types appropriately. This involves modifying the conditional checks for different types of `key` objects and ensuring that the correct indexing method (loc or iloc) is chosen based on the type of the `key` and the index type.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
In this corrected version, the correct check for integer types is performed using `is_integer(key)` function, and the indexing operation handling is adjusted accordingly based on the type of the `key`. This will ensure that the function operates as expected for various input scenarios.
