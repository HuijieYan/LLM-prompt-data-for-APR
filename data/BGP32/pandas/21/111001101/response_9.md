### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the type of `key` is not being correctly identified in some cases, leading to an incorrect path being taken in the function logic. This results in the function returning the wrong value.

In the cases provided:
- Both Case 1 and Case 2 pass a list (`['C']`) as `key`, but due to incorrect type identification, the function assumes it's a string.
- Case 3 passes an `Index(['C'], dtype='object')` as `key`, which is also incorrectly categorized as a string.
- Case 4 passes a Series (`0    C`), which is again misinterpreted as a string.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of `key` is correctly identified in all cases. We should handle the different types of inputs such as lists, arrays, Index objects, and Series appropriately. By correctly identifying the type of `key`, we can choose the right path in the logic of the function to return the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype([key], skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the type of `key` is identified accurately in all cases, and proper handling is done based on the input type to return the expected output. This correction ensures that the function behaves as intended for different types of inputs.
