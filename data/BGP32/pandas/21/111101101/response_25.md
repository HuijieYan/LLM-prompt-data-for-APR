### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type when it is not recognized as a list-like structure. The function incorrectly tries to infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype` and then branches into different behaviors based on the inferred type. In the failing tests, the key is of type 'string', but the function mistakenly tries to apply indexing logic based on the inferred type, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we should remove the unnecessary key type inference logic and handle the 'string' type directly for indexing. We can eliminate the branching based on the inferred type and instead focus on handling the key appropriately regardless of its type.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type if hasattr(key, "inferred_type") else None
        else:
            key_type = None
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By simplifying the logic and directly handling the key for indexing, the corrected function should now properly handle the input keys in various forms as expected by the failing tests.
