The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the key type, leading to an incorrect key_type assignment.

I suggest updating the portion of the code where the key_type is inferred to ensure that the correct logic is applied for different key types. Based on the provided runtime and expected values, it seems that the key type should be inferred correctly to handle the key appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):  # check for scalar values
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle different key types appropriately, based on the expected behavior described in the failing test cases.
