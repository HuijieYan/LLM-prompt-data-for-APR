The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, leading to an incorrect determination of its type. This results in the function not returning the expected output when indexing a Series.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the `key` parameter and adjust the logic accordingly. We can achieve this by updating the conditional checks based on the type of `key` and ensuring that the correct indexing method (positional vs. label-based) is applied.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or is_integer(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if all(is_integer(k) for k in key):
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper checks for scalar and integer keys, handles list-like keys, and distinguishes between label-based and positional indexing based on the key type.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
