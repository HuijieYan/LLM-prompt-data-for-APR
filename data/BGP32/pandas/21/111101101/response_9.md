The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `'string'` regardless of the type of `key`. This causes the function to incorrectly treat the key as a string, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the key in the index of the Series.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly infer the type of the `key` and handle each type appropriately. We can modify the code to check for specific types of `key` and return the result accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        # Handle scalar keys
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "mixed":
            # Mixed type key, reindex the Series
            return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version of the function now correctly handles different types of `key` values and avoids the KeyError that was occurring in the previous version. It should now pass the failing test cases provided.
