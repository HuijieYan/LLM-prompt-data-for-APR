The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type when it is not recognized as a list-like object. The function incorrectly tries to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]`, which leads to a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not list-like differently. We can convert the key to a list if it is not already list-like and then proceed with the logic to handle different key types appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the issue of handling non-list-like keys correctly and avoid the `KeyError` that was occurring previously.
