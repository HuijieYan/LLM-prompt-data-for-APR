Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, the issue lies in the `key_type` inference logic within the `_get_with` function. In the provided code, the `key_type` is inferred as `'integer'` when it should be inferred as `'string'` for the failing test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for inferring the `key_type`. Since the failing tests involve cases where the `key` is of object type, we should update the logic to handle object type keys as strings. We can achieve this by checking if the `key` is of object type and then setting the `key_type` accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling object type key as string
    if is_object_dtype(key):
        key_type = 'string'
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by explicitly handling object type keys as strings during the `key_type` inference process. Now, the function should pass the failing tests by correctly inferring the type of the key.
