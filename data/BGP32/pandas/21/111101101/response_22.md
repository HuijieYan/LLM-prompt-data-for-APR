Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the bug seems to occur due to the incorrect handling of the key type in the `_get_with` function. The function tries to infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`, which results in wrong type inference for some cases, leading to the KeyError exception when trying to locate the key in the Series.

To fix this bug, we can modify the key type inference logic and handle different types of keys more explicitly. We can check if the key is an instance of certain types like list, np.ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray, and handle them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function now explicitly handles different types of keys and avoids the key type inference issue that caused the KeyError in the failing test cases. This new version should pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for the given input cases.
