Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue seems to be with the handling of the key_type variable, which is incorrectly set to 'string' in all cases. This leads to an incorrect behavior in the function, causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to properly determine the key_type based on the type of the key passed to the function. We can achieve this by checking the type of the key and updating the key_type variable accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The key_type is determined based on the type of the key and not hardcoded to 'string'. This correction should ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing tests.
