### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior for indexing using a list key is inconsistent compared to other types of key inputs like numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series.

The failing test expects an error to be raised (KeyError) when trying to index a Series using a list key that does not match any values in the index. However, the current implementation does not raise the error when a list key is used, leading to an inconsistency in behavior.

### Identified Bugs:
1. The conditional block for handling a list key does not raise the expected KeyError when a value in the list does not exist in the Series index.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional block that handles a list key does not have the logic to raise a KeyError when none of the values from the list key exist in the Series index. This results in the inconsistency in behavior for indexing using a list key compared to other types of keys.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and maintain consistency in behavior across different types of key inputs, we need to ensure that when a list key is used and none of the values in the list exist in the Series index, a KeyError is raised as expected by the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that handles the list key input correctly:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not np.in1d(key, self.index).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check `if not np.in1d(key, self.index).all():` before returning for list key input, the corrected version ensures that a KeyError is raised if none of the values in the list exist in the Series index. This fix aligns the behavior for indexing with list keys with the expectations from the failing test, thereby resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
