### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of indexers like slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, etc.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that when using a list indexer, the behavior is inconsistent compared to other indexers like numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially for lists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other indexers like numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The issue arises when trying to access values using a list indexer, leading to a KeyError even when the value is present in the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. The goal is to make the behavior of list indexers consistent with numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that ensures consistent handling of list indexers:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the corrections as shown above, the function will now handle list indexers consistently with other indexers, resolving the KeyError issue.
