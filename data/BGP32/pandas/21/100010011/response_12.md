### Analysis:
The issue mentioned in the GitHub post relates to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers on a Series object. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it raises a KeyError, while other types do not behave in the same way. The provided buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers, and it seems that the logic for handling a list indexer is causing the observed inconsistency and test failures.

### Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function `_get_with` is in the block related to handling a list indexer:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the `_get_with` function when dealing with list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The current implementation explicitly returns `self.loc[key]` when `key` is not list-like. This causes a KeyError when a list indexer is used, leading to inconsistencies in behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and ensure consistent behavior, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case when `key` is a list indexer. We should avoid directly calling `self.loc[key]` and handle list indexers similar to how other types of indexers are treated.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle the case where key is a list indexer
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency and pass the failing tests related to the issue reported on GitHub.
