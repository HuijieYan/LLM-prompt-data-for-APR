## Analysis:
The bug occurs when indexing a Series with a list key, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to indexing with other types of keys like np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series. The failing test is related to the behavior of indexing with list key, where an expected KeyError is not raised.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling different types of keys for indexing. In the if-elif-else statements, the logic for handling a list key is not properly implemented, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that indexing with a list key behaves consistently with other types of keys and raises a KeyError when there are no matches in the index. We need to correct the logic for handling list keys to achieve the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Corrected handling of list key
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly handles list keys by converting them to lists when needed and ensures consistent behavior with other key types. This fix should resolve the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
