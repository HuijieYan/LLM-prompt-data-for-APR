### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series.
- The error message in the failing test states that the bug is related to the different behavior when indexing with list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
- The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency when indexing with list compared to other types.
- The bug seems to be in the handling of key types inside the `_get_with` function, specifically when the key is a list.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by different behaviors for different types of indexers inside the `_get_with` function.
- When the key is a list, the function tries to locate the key in the index, leading to a KeyError when the key is not found.
- This behavior is inconsistent with other indexer types like np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug can be fixed by ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers, similar to the behavior when indexing with a list.
- Specifically, when the key is a list, the function should handle it in a way that does not raise a KeyError but instead returns NaN.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected code ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers when handling a key that is a list. It avoids raising a KeyError when the key is not found by returning NaN instead. This fix aligns with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue and resolves the inconsistency in indexing with different types.
