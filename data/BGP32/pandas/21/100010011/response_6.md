### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The failing test is trying to check the behavior of indexing with different types of objects such as lists, NumPy arrays, Index, and Series.
3. The error message indicates a KeyError being raised when indexing with a list, which is inconsistent with the behavior when indexing with other types of objects.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different types of objects.
5. The bug seems to be related to how indexing with a list is handled within the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in the `_get_with` function when indexing with a list. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexers, but it fails to properly handle lists, leading to a KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects. Specifically, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly and prevent the KeyError from being raised.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Modified this block to handle all list-like objects consistently
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Consistently handle key_type == "integer" as before
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list indexes and reindex in other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects, including lists. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
