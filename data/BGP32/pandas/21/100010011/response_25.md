### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing keys for a Series object. The error message from the failing test indicates a problem with how list indexers are handled, specifically causing a `KeyError` when trying to access a value not present in the Series index.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to how list-like keys are being processed within the `_get_with` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When dealing with list-like keys, the function does not handle them properly and fails to raise a `KeyError` as expected.
2. The different handling of list indexers compared to other indexers leads to inconsistency in behavior.
3. The existing logic in the function does not appropriately account for list indexers, causing the failing test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers to avoid the `KeyError`.
2. Adjust the logic in the function to handle list indexers in a similar way to array-like indexers.
3. Update the function to raise `KeyError` when a value in the list indexer is not present in the Series index.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list-like key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        missing_indices = [idx for idx in key if idx not in self.index]
        if missing_indices:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_indices} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Reindex for other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Added a condition to handle list-like keys before checking other types.
2. Check for missing indices in the list key and raise a `KeyError` if any of them are not present in the Series index.
3. This update ensures consistent error handling for list indexers and aligns the behavior with other index types.

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
