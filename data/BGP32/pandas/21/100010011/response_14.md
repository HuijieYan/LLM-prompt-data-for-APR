### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexing operations on a Series object. The function encounters an issue when indexing with a list-like object, such as a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The error messages from the failing test cases indicate that the function is not correctly handling the list-like object when indexing, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional branches in the function not properly handling list-like objects during indexing. The function fails to return the expected output when indexing with list-like objects, leading to KeyErrors in the test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like objects correctly when indexing. We should aim to have consistent behavior for different types of indexers to prevent KeyErrors and maintain expected functionality.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Convert key to list if not already a list
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like objects more explicitly by converting them to lists if necessary. We also consider mixed-integer dtype for key_type and address boolean indexers separately to ensure consistent behavior for different indexers. This should resolve the issues reported in the failing test cases and GitHub issue.
