### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function contains multiple conditional statements to check the type of the key and perform the corresponding indexing operation. However, the bug is related to the treatment of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list as the key for indexing.

The failing tests indicate that using a list as the key for indexing does not raise a `KeyError` as expected, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers like arrays, Index, and Series.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs due to the conditional check `elif not is_list_like(key):` where scalars that are not recognized as list-like are handled by accessing the key using `.loc`. This behavior causes the test case with a list key to fail to raise a `KeyError` as expected.
2. The inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array, Index, Series) leads to the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers when indexing a Series object. Specifically, we need to modify the conditional checks related to list-like keys and ensure that a raising `KeyError` is consistent across all types of indexers.

### Bug-fixed Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated the conditional block to improve consistency
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case for list indexer
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently and will raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index, aligning with the expected behavior across different types of indexers. Once this correction is applied, the failing test cases related to list indexers should pass successfully.
