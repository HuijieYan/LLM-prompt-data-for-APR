### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the Series class of Pandas is not handling the case where a list indexer is passed correctly. This results in inconsistent behavior compared to other array-like indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. As a result, the test cases are failing with `KeyError` because the expected behavior is not being met.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block checking for `is_list_like(key)` may not be handling the list indexer properly.
2. The return statement inside the conditional block for a list indexer might not be returning the correct result.

### Bug Cause:
The root cause of the bug is the mishandling of list indexers inside the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, it does not go through the correct path of indexing, resulting in a `KeyError`. This inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers leads to failing test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that list indexers are handled correctly within the conditional blocks.
2. Make sure that the return statement for list indexers returns the expected result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This fix should resolve the failing test cases related to list indexers not being found in the index. Now, the function should behave as expected and pass the provided test cases.
