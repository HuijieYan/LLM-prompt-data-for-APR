### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle various types of indexers for a Series object in pandas. The function checks the type of the input key and processes it accordingly. The specific error messages from failing tests indicate that there is an inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. 

The failing test cases show that when using `ser[list(key)]`, an error is being raised due to a discrepancy in how list-like objects are handled compared to other types of indexers. This is causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. When a list-like object is passed as an indexer, it is not properly handled, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like objects are handled consistently with other types of indexers within the function `_get_with`. Specifically, we need to modify the logic to correctly process list-like objects to avoid the `KeyError`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list-like objects correctly, ensuring consistency in how different types of indexers are processed.
