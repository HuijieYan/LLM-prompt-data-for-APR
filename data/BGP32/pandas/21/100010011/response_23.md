### Steps to Fix the Bug:

1. Analyze the problem: The bug is related to the different behaviors when indexing a Series with list-like objects (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series). The issue is that when indexing a Series with a list, it is inconsistent compared to other array-like indexers.

2. Potential error locations: The bug seems to occur when checking the type of the key and handling the indexing differently based on the type.

3. Explanation of the bug:
   - When indexing a Series with list-like objects, such as a list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series, the behavior is inconsistent.
   - The error message indicates that the KeyError is raised when using `ser[list(key)]`.
   - The issue is related to how the key is handled and the inconsistency in handling different types.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the code to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects.
   - Ensure that all different array-like indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) produce the same result.
   - Implement a unified approach to handle indexing with list-like objects in the Series.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Updated handling for different array-like indexers
    # Handle Index, Series, np.ndarray, list similarly
    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of different array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series.py` file, we ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with list-like objects. This correction should address the inconsistency and pass the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
