### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that when using a list-like key input, such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the behavior is inconsistent. Specifically, the error message states that the key (`"C"`) is not found in the index.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers, and this is reflected in the failing test cases.
4. The cause of the bug is related to how the function attempts to process different types of key inputs, especially for list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key, such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function treats them differently and does not handle them consistently, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function logic to handle list-like keys consistently and ensure that the key lookup is performed correctly for all types of list-like inputs.
- Ensure that the function appropriately checks for the existence of the provided key in the Series index to prevent KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key if isinstance(key, list) else key.to_list()
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like keys consistently, ensuring that the key lookup is done correctly for all types of list-like inputs. This correction should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub thread and pass the failing test cases.
