### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers when indexing a Series. However, there is a discrepancy in the behavior when using list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers such as arrays, indexes, and Series. This inconsistency is causing a test failure where the behavior expected for list indexers is not matching the behavior observed for array-like indexers.

The error message indicates that when using a Series as an indexer in a list context, a `KeyError` is raised because none of the items in the indexer are found in the Series index. This behavior is different from using arrays, indexes, and other Series as indexers where the operation succeeds despite the absence of matching items.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

The bug may be related to the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The conditional logic for different types of indexers may not be consistent, leading to the observed discrepancy in behavior.

### Causes of the bug

The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list-like indexer is provided, the code path taken for processing it may not align with the behavior expected from other types of indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The goal is to handle list-like indexers in a way that does not raise a `KeyError` when none of the indexer items are found in the Series index.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, preventing the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test.
