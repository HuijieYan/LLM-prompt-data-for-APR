### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for indexing a pandas Series object with different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list-like keys, etc.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexers of type list.
- The failing test cases indicate that when indexing a Series with a list key, the function is not producing the expected result and is raising a `KeyError`.
- The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers like list, arrays, etc.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the function incorrectly treating list indexers differently from other types of indexers like arrays, Index, and Series.
- In the case of a list key, the function is not able to handle it properly and raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected result.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers the same way it handles other types of indexers like arrays or Index.
- We need to update the code in the function to handle list indexers correctly and return the expected output without raising any errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list indexers within the function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output without raising any `KeyError`.
