### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
- The error messages from failing tests indicate issues with handling the key as a list, array, or a dataframe.
- The GitHub issue suggests that the inconsistency in behavior when using list-like key indexers should be addressed.
  
### Bugs:
1. The function does not handle list-like key indexers correctly, causing KeyErrors in certain scenarios.
2. It does not provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle list-like key indexers, resulting in KeyErrors when using certain types of indexers. Specifically, list key indexers do not match the index correctly, leading to the KeyError in the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like key indexers are handled correctly by matching them with the index in a way that is consistent with other indexers. Additionally, the function should provide consistent behavior for all types of indexers to avoid unexpected errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = self.index._convert_list_like_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Check if key is a list to handle the duplication indexing case
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key].values

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now handles list-like key indexers correctly by converting them to a suitable format for indexing. This fix should resolve the KeyErrors encountered in the failing tests and provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers, as requested in the GitHub issue.
