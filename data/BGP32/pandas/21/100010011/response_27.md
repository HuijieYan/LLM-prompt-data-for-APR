## Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of keys while indexing a Series. The function checks the type of the key provided and performs different operations accordingly.

The error messages from the failing tests indicate that when passing a key as a list, `ser[key]` operation raises a `KeyError` instead of handling it like other types such as `pd.Index` or `pd.Series`.

The GitHub issue points out this inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers and the possible reason for this discrepancy. It suggests aligning the behavior of all types of indexers to be consistent and avoid unexpected errors for users.

## Identifying potential error locations within the function

The issue is most likely occurring in the part of the function where a list-like key is processed. The function should handle list-like keys similarly to other indexers like `pd.Index`, `np.array`, or `pd.Series`.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug occurs when a list-like key is provided to index the Series. The `_get_with` function does not correctly handle list-like keys, leading to a `KeyError` exception instead of processing it similar to other types of keys.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should treat list-like keys in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. By adjusting the logic for list-like keys, the function can handle them properly without raising a `KeyError`.

## Corrected version of the function

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version should now handle list-like keys appropriately and should pass the failing test cases provided.
