### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexing keys for a Series object in Pandas. The error message from the failing test indicates an issue with the handling of list-like indexers. The test cases compare the behavior of indexing a Series with a list, ndarray, Index, and another Series.

The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in Pandas. The test case fails when indexing a Series with a list, raising a KeyError even though the expected behavior should be returning NaN values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The section of code where list-like keys are handled might be problematic.
2. The implementation of different behaviors for array-like and list-like indexers could be causing the incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function triggers a KeyError when indexing with a list-like key, which contradicts the expected behavior of returning NaN values. This behavior is inconsistent with indexing using array-like keys or Index objects. The misinterpretation of list indexers leads to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that indexing a Series with list-like keys behaves consistently with array-like keys and Index objects. The key point is to handle list-like keys correctly, allowing NaN values to be returned instead of raising a KeyError. Adjusting the code logic to treat list-like keys in a manner similar to other types of keys is necessary for resolving the bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_is_list_like = is_list_like(key)
    
    if key_is_list_like:
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = None

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "boolean":
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like keys by converting them to a list and then performing the necessary operations. This revised implementation ensures consistent behavior across different types of keys when indexing a Series in Pandas.
