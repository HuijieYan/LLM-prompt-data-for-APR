### Analysis:
The `test_getitem_no_matches` test case is failing due to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) with a Series object. The behavior is inconsistent in terms of handling missing elements when performing indexing operations. The failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when an indexer does not exist in the Series object, but the behavior is inconsistent for different types of indexers.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the function `_get_with` not handling the case of a list-like object as an indexer properly. When a list-like indexer is passed to the function, it is not correctly processed to raise the appropriate `KeyError` when an element doesn't exist.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the implementation of the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers by iterating over each element in the list and raising `KeyError` if any element does not exist in the Series object.
2. Ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of indexers when elements are missing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        values = self.loc[key].values
        index_values = self.index.values
        missing_elements = [element for element in key if element not in index_values]
        
        if missing_elements:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_elements} are in the index")

        return self.loc[key]

    ...
``` 

By iterating over each element in the list-like indexer `key`, we can identify the missing elements that are not present in the Series object. If any missing elements are found, a `KeyError` is raised indicating those elements. This ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers when elements are missing.
