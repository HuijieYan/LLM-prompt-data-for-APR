### Analysis:
1. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function is expecting an error with a specific message when passing a key that does not match any index values.
2. The function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is handling different types of key inputs like slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others.
3. The error occurs when passing a key that is of type list, but the function tries to handle it incorrectly.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically mentioning the issue with `ser[list(key)]`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of key as a list in the `_get_with` function. When a key is passed as a list, it gets converted to a list of Index objects, which leads to the KeyError in the test due to mismatch in index values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a key is of type list, it should not convert to a list of Index objects. Instead, it should behave like other array-like indexers to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # modifying the list handling here
        elif all(isinstance(k, list) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key[0]]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a condition to check if all elements in the key are of type list, which allows correct handling of list indexers.
2. Instead of converting the list to a list of Index objects, it now directly accesses elements when all keys are lists.

By making this change in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
