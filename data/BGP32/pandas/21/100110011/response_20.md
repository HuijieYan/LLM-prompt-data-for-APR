### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Test Code:
The buggy function `_get_with` is used for indexing a Series object with various data types of keys. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of keys (list, numpy array, Index, Series). The test fails with a KeyError, indicating that the expected behavior is not met when indexing with a list.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling non-list-like keys might not properly handle all cases.
2. The block of code for handling a list as a key might have an issue causing the failure scenario.

### Explaining the Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely stems from a discrepancy in how the `_get_with` function handles different types of indexers. The failing test specifically focuses on indexing with a list, highlighting an inconsistency in the behavior of the function for list-like keys.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function needs to be reviewed. The behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers, aligning with the expectations set by the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list for consistent handling

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, non-list-like keys are converted to a list for consistent handling. This change should align the behavior for all types of keys and address the issue reported in the failing test.
