### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is causing an issue when trying to handle list-like indexers. The issue arises when using a list as the key to index a Series, causing a `KeyError`. The failing test in `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking this scenario, where the function should raise a `KeyError` but it fails to do so.

The code currently does not properly handle list-like keys, resulting in unexpected behavior and errors. It fails to differentiate between different types of key inputs, leading to the Error message in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When a list is passed as a key, it should return a `KeyError`, but due to improper handling, it fails to raise the exception.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list is provided as the key, the function raises a `KeyError` as expected. This can be achieved by adding a condition to explicitly check for list-type keys and raise the `KeyError` appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected logic to handle list-like keys, the function should now raise a `KeyError` when a list is provided as the key, passing the failing test and resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
