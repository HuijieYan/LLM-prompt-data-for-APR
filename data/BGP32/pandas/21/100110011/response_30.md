### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a `Series`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is attempting to index a `Series` with a key that does not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError`.
3. The error message indicates that the test did not raise the expected `KeyError`, which suggests that the buggy function is not handling certain types of indexers correctly.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a `Series` with different types of indexers like lists, arrays, etc.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from how the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class handles different types of indexers. It fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, causing the test to not raise the expected `KeyError`. The issue in the GitHub report also points out this inconsistency in behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function properly handles list-like indexers to be consistent with other types of indexers. We should aim to make the behavior align with the case of indexing with lists, arrays, etc., as shown in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug and pass the failing test by handling list-like indexers correctly. It aligns the behavior with other types of indexers, ensuring consistency across various indexer types.
