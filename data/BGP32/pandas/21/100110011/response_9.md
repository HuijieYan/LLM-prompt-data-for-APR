### Analysis:
1. The provided buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` checks if a KeyError is raised when trying to index a Series with a key that has no matches.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the KeyError was not raised, which means the current implementation does not handle the case of indexing a Series with a key that has no matches properly.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of key indexers are treated, with `ser[list(key)]` raising an error while other array-like indexers do not.
5. The bug is caused by not handling the case of a key with no matches properly, especially when the key is of type list.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function not correctly handling the case when indexing a Series with a key that has no matches.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the key is of type list and does not have any matching values in the Series index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to handle the case when `key` is a list and has no matches in the Series index, the corrected function ensures consistent behavior for different types of key indexers.
