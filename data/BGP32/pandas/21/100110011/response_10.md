### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file contains a bug where it treats different types of indexers inconsistently, which leads to errors when trying to access a Series using an index with no matches. The failing test in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` triggers a `KeyError` due to this inconsistency.

The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches" highlights this inconsistency in how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behaviors and error messages.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent handling of different index types. The function tries to differentiate between list-like indexers and other types, but the code for handling the list indexers is incorrect. This leads to `KeyError` when accessing a Series with an index that has no matches. The bug causes confusion and inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers.
2. Update the condition for handling list indexers to match the behavior of other indexers.
3. Simplify the function to have a clear flow for handling different index types.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Correct the handling of list-like key to avoid KeyError
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `if is_list_like(key)` condition and handling list-like keys correctly, we ensure that the `_get_with` function handles different types of indexers consistently, fixing the bug and resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
