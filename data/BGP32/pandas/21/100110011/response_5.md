### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, arrays, and more. The issue arises when dealing with indexers that are lists, arrays, or Index objects, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` aims to test the behavior of a Series when accessing elements that do not exist in the index. The test uses different types of indexers like lists, arrays, Index, and Series to evaluate the consistency of behavior.

Based on the provided error messages from the failing test, we can see that the test expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but the buggy `_get_with` function does not raise it correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. When the key type is a list, the function should raise a `KeyError` similar to how it behaves for other index types, including arrays, Index, and Series. This inconsistency leads to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function consistently handles list indexers and raises a `KeyError` when accessing elements that do not exist in the Series index. By updating the logic to handle list indexers properly, we can align the behavior with other types of indexers and passing the failing test.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the `raise KeyError` statement inside the block for handling non-list like keys, we ensure that any attempt to access non-existing index elements using a list indexer leads to a `KeyError` being raised consistently. This correction aligns the function's behavior with the expected outcome and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
