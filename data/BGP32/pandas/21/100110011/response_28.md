### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of `key` inputs and deciding how to retrieve the corresponding values.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses different types of `key` inputs like list, ndarray, Index, and Series to index a Series and expects consistent behavior.
3. The error occurs when passing a list `key` to the Series, causing a `KeyError` as it does not handle the list-like indexer properly.
4. The bug is related to how the function handles different types of `key` inputs and does not account for list-like indexers properly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the function handles list-like indexers and ensure consistency in behavior for different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `key` is list-like when it fails to match any previous conditions, and handle it appropriately.
2. Ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers to align with user expectations and maintain clarity in API usage.
3. Update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly to resolve the `KeyError` issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like indexers properly
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly, the corrected version should pass the failing test, resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub post, and maintain consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
