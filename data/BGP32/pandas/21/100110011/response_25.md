### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses different types of indexers to access values from a Series, leading to a KeyError.
3. The error message indicates that the expected KeyError was not raised when accessing values with a specific type of indexer.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers in a Series.
5. Based on the issue description, the list-based indexer behavior is causing inconsistencies and the function should be modified to align with other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the handling of list indexers differently from array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This leads to inconsistent behavior when accessing values using a list indexer, resulting in a KeyError when it should return NaN like the other indexer types.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-based indexers in a similar way as other array-like indexers to maintain consistency. This involves ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected output when accessing values using list indexers.

### Correction:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle list-based indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, fixing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
