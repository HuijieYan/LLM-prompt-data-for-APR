### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series object.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of using different types of indexers on a Series object and expecting a KeyError in a specific scenario.
- The error message indicates that the KeyError was not raised when using a list key with the Series object.
- The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.
- The issue specifically mentions that using `ser[list(key)]` does not raise a KeyError, unlike other indexers.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function is in the section where the type of the key is checked. When the key type is a list, it falls through to the final return statement (`self.reindex(key)`) instead of raising a KeyError when the key value is not present in the Series object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, you need to modify the code to ensure that when a list key is used and the key value is not present in the Series object, a KeyError is raised consistently with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a `raise KeyError` statement inside the condition for a non-list-like key type, we ensure consistent KeyError handling when a key value is not found in the Series index. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
