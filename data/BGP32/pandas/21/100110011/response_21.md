### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is causing an issue when it encounters a key that is a list-like object. The function does not handle list-like objects correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses various box types, including lists, arrays, Index, and Series, to index a Series object.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed to raise a `KeyError`, suggesting that the buggy function is not handling the list-like key correctly.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers, with the former causing a `KeyError`.
5. To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to properly handle list-like keys and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When encountering a list-like key, the function should use `self.loc[key]` instead of returning `self.reindex(key)`, as this leads to a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is a list-like object.
2. If the key is a list-like object, use `self.loc[key]` to properly handle indexing.
3. Ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version above, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys properly and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This fix should address the `KeyError` issue when indexing a Series object with a list-like key.
