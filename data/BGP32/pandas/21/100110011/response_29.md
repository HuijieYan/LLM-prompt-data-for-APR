### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` has conditional checks based on the input `key` type to determine the indexing behavior.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is designed to test the behavior of indexing when using different types of input arrays/series.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not raised as expected when using certain types of indexers.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a discrepancy in how different types of indexers are handled in `ser[key]` indexing operations.
5. The bug seems to be related to how list-like indexers are being processed compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the if-block `elif not is_list_like(key)` condition in the `_get_with` function. When key is a list, it does not follow the expected KeyError propagation behavior, causing the test to fail.

### Fixing Strategy:
- Update the handling of list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers.
- Ensure that when a list indexer is used and there are no matches in the index, a KeyError is raised consistently.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):  # Modified condition
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_scalar(key):  # Modified condition
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition for list-like indexers and checking for scalar values before attempting to index, the corrected function should now raise a KeyError consistently for indexers with no matches in the index, fixing the bug.
