### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is supposed to handle different types of indexing keys for a Series object in pandas. However, the function fails to properly handle the case where the key is a list-like object.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` from the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file specifically tests the behavior of indexing a Series object with a key that does not match any values in the index. The test uses different types of box objects such as lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index objects, and pandas Series objects to create the keys.

The error message indicates that the test fails when using a list as the key, showing a `KeyError` being raised when it should not be raised.

### Identifying the bug

The issue seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` processes list-like keys. When handling a list key, the function incorrectly reverts to using `self.loc[key]` which ends up raising a `KeyError` when a non-matching key is provided.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys properly. We should return `self.loc[key]` only if the key is a scalar (single value) and the item is present in the index. Otherwise, we should return `self.reindex(key)`.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic for list-like keys to use `self.reindex(key)` when the key is a list or an ndarray, the corrected function should now properly handle the case where a non-matching key is provided. This fix should make the failing test pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
