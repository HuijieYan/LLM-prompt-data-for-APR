## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in pandas' `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access elements of a Series using different types of indexers, such as lists, ndarrays, and Series, but it fails when using a list for the indexer.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the conditional check for `not is_list_like(key)`. When the key is a list, it skips the expected behavior and tries to use `self.loc[key]`, leading to a KeyError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a list, it should return the expected behavior for accessing elements based on the list indexer instead of treating it like other types. This matches the behavior of accessing elements using other types like ndarrays or Series.
5. By adjusting the conditional checks and handling a list indexer separately, we can correct the bug.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = list(key)
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that a list indexer is handled separately to match the expected behavior when accessing Series elements. Therefore, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue mentioned earlier.
