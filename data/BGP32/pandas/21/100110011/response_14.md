### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is testing the behavior of getting items from a Series using different types of key inputs like list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series.
3. The error message indicates that when using an indexer of type `list`, it raises a `KeyError` because it cannot find the specified items in the index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently than array-like indexers and the desire to make them behave similarly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation of `_get_with` function does not handle the case when the key input is of type `list` correctly. It tries to locate items directly, resulting in a `KeyError` when the items are not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the list-like input similarly to other array-like indexers. This involves ensuring that key elements in a list that are not matched in the index do not result in a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional checks and handling the case of a list-like key input properly, the corrected function should now handle all types of indexers consistently.

This fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test.
