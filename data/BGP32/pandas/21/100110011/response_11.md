### Analyzing the Bug:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexing cases for a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` checks the behavior when trying to access non-existent keys in a Series object using different index types: list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series.
3. The failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised but it does not happen for certain types of indexes like list. This behavior is inconsistent and contrary to the expected outcome described in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs when the key is of type `pd.Index`. The function wrongly treats it as an array-like indexer instead of handling it as a list indexer.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function. When the key is of type `Index`, the function should handle it differently by converting it to a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The fix involves modifying the logic to explicitly convert the key to a list whenever it is an instance of `Index` before proceeding with the indexing operation. This ensures consistent behavior across different index types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_is_index = isinstance(key, Index)
    if key_is_index:
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert Index to list

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if key_is_index:
            return self.reindex(key)
        key_type = key.inferred_type if key_is_index else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these changes, the corrected function now explicitly converts the key to a list when it is of type `Index`, ensuring consistent behavior across different index types and resolving the bug.
