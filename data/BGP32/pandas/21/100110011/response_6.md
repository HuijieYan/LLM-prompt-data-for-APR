### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for a pandas Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is trying to access an element from a Series using an index that does not match any values in the Series index.
3. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is expected but not raised when trying to access an element using a key that does not match any index values.
4. The GitHub issue points out inconsistency in how different indexers (list, array-like) are handled, with the list case raising a `KeyError` while the others do not.
  
### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the `_get_with` function does not handle the case of indexing with a list properly. When a list key is provided, it tries to reindex using the list, which may not match any existing index values, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case of list-like key more consistently, ensuring that a `KeyError` in raised for such cases when no match is found in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the code to include a check for list-like keys and raising a `KeyError` if none of the key values are present in the index, we can ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
