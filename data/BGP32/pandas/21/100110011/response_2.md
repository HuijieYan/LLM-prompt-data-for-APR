### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` in the file `pandas/core/series.py` is causing a KeyError while handling certain types of indexers.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is designed to check this issue.
3. The test is passing different types of indexers like list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, highlighting the inconsistency in behavior.
4. The GitHub issue `API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]` also points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other indexers.
5. The main issue is with how the function treats list indexers, resulting in a KeyError. The desired behavior should be consistent across all types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to how the function `_get_with` handles list indexers. When a list indexer is passed, the function calls `self.loc[key]`, resulting in the KeyError.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly and are not leading to a KeyError. We will modify the function to have a consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function as above, we ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other indexers, eliminating the KeyError issue encountered when using lists. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue regarding the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
