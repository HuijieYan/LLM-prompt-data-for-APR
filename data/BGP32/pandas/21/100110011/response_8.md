### Analysis:
- The `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` aims to check the behavior when an indexer does not match any values in the Series.
- The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected when using certain types of indexers.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of how different types of indexers are handled, specifically focusing on the discrepancy when using a list as an indexer.

### Error Location:
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be primarily related to how list-like indexers are handled differently than other types.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle all types of indexers consistently. Particularly, when a list indexer is provided, it doesn't raise a KeyError as expected, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle all types of indexers uniformly, ensuring that if an indexer does not match any values in the Series, it raises a KeyError consistently across different indexer types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):  # Check if key is list-like
        # Simply return the corresponding value from the Series
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if any(isinstance(key, t) for t in [np.ndarray, Series, Index]):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        key_is_list = False
    else:
        key_type = 'integer'
        key_is_list = True

    if key_type == 'integer':
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_is_list:
        # Handle the case of list indexing
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")

    return self.reindex(key)

```

With this corrected version of the function `_get_with`, the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers should be resolved, ensuring that a KeyError is raised consistently for indexers like lists when no matches are found in the Series.
