### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing a Series. The issue seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and failing test cases.

### Bug Location:
The root cause of the bug seems to be in the handling of list-like indexers in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block and the subsequent branches.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function fails to handle list-like indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access the Series using a list indexer. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, `Index`) are correctly handled in the function `_get_with`. The function should treat list-like indexers consistently and retrieve the appropriate values from the Series.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures consistent handling of list-like indexers. By converting the key to an index if it is list-like and utilizing the appropriate location-based or label-based indexing methods, the bug should be resolved. This fix should address the failing test cases and the issue reported on GitHub.
