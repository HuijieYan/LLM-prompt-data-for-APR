### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index of the Series.
3. The error message suggests that the indexing behavior is inconsistent when using list-like indexers compared to other types like arrays, indexes, or Series.
4. The GitHub issue points out this inconsistency in behavior and questions the rationale behind treating list indexers differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers correctly. It differentiates between index, DataFrame, tuple, and other types properly, but fails to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. It should raise a `KeyError` when accessing a key that does not exist in the index, matching the behavior of other types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):
        # Consistently handle list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version, the function should now handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in consistent behavior across different types of key inputs. This fix should resolve the inconsistency observed in the failing test and address the GitHub issue related to inconsistent indexing behavior.
