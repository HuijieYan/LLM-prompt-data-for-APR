### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing values from a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses various types of indexers to access values from a Series and expects consistent behavior.
3. The failing test raises a `KeyError` because the current implementation does not handle certain types of indexers, specifically lists, in the expected manner.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers and questions the rationale behind this behavior.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when a list indexer is used to access values from a Series. The current implementation leads to a `KeyError` due to the inconsistency in handling the different types of indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other types of indexers. This will ensure that accessing values from a Series with list indexers does not raise a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, list):  # Modify this condition to include isinstance(key, list)
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a condition to handle list indexers in the same manner as other types of indexers, we ensure consistent behavior when accessing values from a Series. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
