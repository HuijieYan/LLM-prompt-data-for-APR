### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects.
2. The bug is likely related to how the function is handling the case of a list indexer, where the issue arises with the error message stating that the key is not in the index.
3. The failing test case expects the behavior of list, numpy array, Index, and Series indexers to be consistent when accessing items in a Series.
4. The bug seems to stem from the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing KeyError exceptions.
5. Since the test case expects a consistent behavior for all types of indexers, the bug can be fixed by adjusting the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers. We should modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers and avoid raising KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected code for the buggy function `_get_with`:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handling list indexers to ensure consistency
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function to return the appropriate values without raising KeyError exceptions, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
