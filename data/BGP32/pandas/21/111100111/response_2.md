### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is checking the type of the key parameter and based on the type, it is performing different operations.
2. The error seems to occur when a key of type `Index` is passed to the function, as it doesn't handle it correctly.
3. The bug is related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. The failing test is expecting a specific behavior when a list indexer is used, but the function is not handling it correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling `Index` type keys and ensure that the function behaves consistently for different types of indexers.
5. I will modify the `_get_with` function to check for an `Index` type key and properly handle it to address the bug.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle the various types of keys consistently and address the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
