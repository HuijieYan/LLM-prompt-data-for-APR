The bug in the provided `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is passed. The function does not properly handle the case when a list indexer is provided, leading to a KeyError in certain situations.

The cause of the bug can be traced to the portion of the code where a list-like key is being processed. The function incorrectly attempts to convert the key to a list before determining the key_type. This incorrect conversion leads to an issue when trying to access the element in the index that is not present.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that handles list-like keys. Instead of converting the key to a list directly, we should first check if it is a list-like type, and then proceed accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)

        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )

        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)

        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should now properly handle list-like keys, passing the provided failing test cases.
