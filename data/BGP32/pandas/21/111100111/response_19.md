The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the logic handling the key variable when it is a list. The function currently treats a key variable of list type differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior. It fails to handle the list key properly, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to index the Series with a list of non-existing values.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function treats all array-like indexers consistently. We can achieve this by modifying the logic to handle list type keys in the same way as other indexers. By ensuring that the key is converted to a list type regardless of its current type, we can address the issue and allow for proper indexing even when the key contains non-existent values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list regardless of its current type
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle all array-like indexers, including list type keys, ensuring consistent behavior and addressing the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
