The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in the `Series` class. This bug is specifically affecting the handling of the list indexer, causing an inconsistency in behavior and the raised error message.

The issue arises from the point where the function checks for `isinstance(key, Index)` since the `key` is actually a list but being mistaken for an Index instance. This leads to the incorrect inference of the key type and incorrect behavior in further processing.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for identifying the type of `key` correctly and handle the list case properly to avoid the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling the case for list-like key
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Correcting the logic for identifying the key type
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handling the key types appropriately
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle array-like indexers
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle list indexers appropriately and avoid the error highlighted in the GitHub issue. This fix ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers in the `Series` class.
