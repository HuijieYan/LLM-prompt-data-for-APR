## Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` might not correctly identify when the key is not list-like.
2. The conversion of key to a list in `key = list(key)` may not handle all cases properly.
3. The decision-making process for positional versus label-based indexing based on `key_type == "integer"` could be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of key inputs. Specifically, when using a list as the key, the bug leads to a KeyError stating that none of the items are in the index, which is not consistent with how other array-like key inputs are handled.

The bug stems from the specific handling of key types in the `_get_with` function of the Series class. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` is meant to handle non-list-like key types, but it might not be correctly identifying them. Additionally, the conversion to a list using `key = list(key)` may not cover all cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of key inputs are properly handled in the `_get_with` function. Specifically:
1. Check and handle non-list-like keys correctly.
2. Ensure that the conversion of key to a list covers all necessary cases.
3. Verify the decision-making process for positional versus label-based indexing based on key types is accurate.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys correctly
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's not a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, or Index
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle cases where key is of type 'integer'
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the corrections mentioned above, the updated `_get_with` function should now handle different types of key inputs consistently and correctly, ensuring that the Series indexing behavior aligns with user expectations.
