## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is an issue with how it treats non-list like keys. The bug arises when a key is provided in a list-like format, but the function incorrectly handles it, resulting in a KeyError.

In the failing test, a Series is created with values ["A", "B"], and then an attempt is made to access a key "C" using a non-matching key format. The expected behavior is that a KeyError should be raised, indicating that "C" is not present in the index.

The bug relates to how the function handles different key types and how it should respond to non-matching keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that it correctly handles non-list like keys and raises a KeyError when the key is not present in the index. Specifically, we should adjust the logic for determining the key type and the way it handles keys of different types.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not is_dict_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or is_dict_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        if key.dtype == object:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            key_type = key.dtype.kind
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added checks for ensuring that the key is a list-like object and not a dictionary-like object before handling it as a list. We also explicitly handle cases where the key is not list-like or dictionary-like, raising a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

This correction should resolve the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected in handling different key types and raising an appropriate error for non-matching keys.
