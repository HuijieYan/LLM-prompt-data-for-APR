## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when the input key is a list-like object and the function tries to convert it to a list without correctly handling the conversion in all cases. This causes an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers.
3. The failing test case provides an example where a KeyError is expected because the key is not found in the index. However, the bug causes an error to be raised due to incorrect handling of list-like key inputs.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including list-like objects, are properly handled to provide consistent behavior across different input types.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the type of the key input and handle it appropriately.
2. Ensure that list-like key inputs are correctly converted and processed.
3. Maintain consistency in error handling for all types of indexers.

## Bug Fix
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By updating the `_get_with` function with the provided bug fix, the function will handle list-like key inputs correctly, ensuring consistency in behavior across different types of indexers and passing the failing test case.
