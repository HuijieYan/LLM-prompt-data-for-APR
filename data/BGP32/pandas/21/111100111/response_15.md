## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when a key of type `list`, specifically `key = list(key)`, is passed to the function. This part of the code is causing the KeyError as reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug causes inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing with a list.
4. The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of a key passed as a list, which results in a KeyError when trying to index the Series.

## Fix Strategy
1. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where a key is a list differently from other types of indexers.
2. We can directly return the result of `self.loc[key]` for list-like keys to maintain consistency with other types of indexers.

## Corrected Version
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key = list(key)  # Remove this line
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will return the expected output for the failing test case and handle list-like indexers appropriately.
