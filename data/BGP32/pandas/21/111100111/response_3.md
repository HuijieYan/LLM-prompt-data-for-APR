## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class handles various types of key inputs, including lists, tuples, and other index types. It tries to determine the type of the key and perform specific operations based on that.
2. The bug occurs when a list key is passed to the function. It fails to handle the list key properly and raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected result, causing inconsistency in behavior.
3. The failing test case expects the behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series to be the same. However, the current implementation does not handle the list case correctly, leading to the test failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list keys in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior expected by the test case. This may involve converting the list key to a different type or implementing a separate case for list keys.
5. The corrected version of the `_get_with` function should properly handle list keys and return the expected result.

## Fix
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By ensuring that the key is converted to an Index type using `ensure_index(key)`, we can handle list keys properly in the `_get_with` function. This correction should align the function's behavior with the expected result in the failing test case and resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
