#### Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` has a condition to check if the key is not list-like, in which case it calls `self.loc[key]`. However, in the failing test, the key is a `list` that contains an element not present in the Series, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

Looking at the failing test, the goal is to have consistent behavior for different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when passed to the Series. The expectation is that the behavior should be similar even if the key doesn't exist in the Series.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and align the behavior for different types of indexers, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case when the key is list-like but contains elements not present in the Series. We should ensure that it doesn't raise a `KeyError` in such situations.

#### Corrected function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will handle list-like keys without throwing a `KeyError` when elements are not found in the Series, aligning the behavior for different types of indexers.
