The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles different types of indexers, specifically when `key` is of type `pd.Index`. The function incorrectly uses the `key_type` based on the inferred dtype of the `key`, which leads to issues when dealing with certain index types like `pd.Index`. The function should handle `pd.Index` differently to ensure proper indexing behavior.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the handling of `key` when it is of type `pd.Index`, ensuring that it is treated correctly to avoid the KeyError. We should also adjust the logic for determining the `key_type` in order to handle cases where `key` is an `pd.Index` properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        key = key.array  # Extract the array from pd.Index
    else:
        key_type = "array-like"

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By introducing the handling of `pd.Index` by extracting the array from it, we ensure that the `_get_with` function operates correctly when dealing with different index types. This should resolve the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test.
