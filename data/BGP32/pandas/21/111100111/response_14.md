## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. However, there is a problem with how it handles a key that is not recognized as list-like but is actually a scalar.
2. The bug occurs when the key is a scalar that is not recognized by the `lib.is_scalar` function, leading to an attempt to access the key using `self.loc[key]`.
3. The failing test case expects the operation to raise a `KeyError`, indicating that the key is not found in the index. The bug causes the function to attempt accessing a scalar key without correctly recognizing it, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of scalar keys by checking if the key is not list-like but still a valid input for the Series index.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle scalar keys correctly
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, slice):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version includes a specific check for scalar keys that are not recognized as list-like by `is_list_like`. It ensures that scalar keys are correctly accessed using `self.loc[key]`, addressing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior in the failing test cases.
