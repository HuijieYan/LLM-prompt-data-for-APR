## Analysis and Fix

### Issue:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list properly, leading to a KeyError being raised when accessing the Series with a list key.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely present in the portion of code that handles the case when `key` is not recognized as list-like and does not fall under any of the previous conditions.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of list keys. When `key` is not recognized as list-like, the function attempts to access `self.loc[key]`, which raises a KeyError because the key is not found in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is not list-like, we handle the list case properly by converting the key to a list and then accessing the `.loc` attribute with the list key. This will align the behavior with other types of indexers.

### Updated Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to list if it's not list-like
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
  
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the mentioned changes, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys properly and prevent the KeyError from being raised when accessing the Series with a list key.

This fix aligns the behavior with other indexer types and addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
