## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for the `Series` object.
2. The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to `_get_with`, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other array-like indexers.
3. The bug results in a `KeyError` when using a list-like indexer.
4. The GitHub issue discusses the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers, suggesting that all should behave like the list case.
   
## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make the behavior consistent for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers. Specifically, we should adjust the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior of other array-like indexers. 

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Adjusted the handling of list-like indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Removed redundant handling of list indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` for list-like indexers, we ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. This fix resolves the inconsistency and aligns the behavior with the expected output for the failing tests.
