## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, there is a discrepancy in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.
2. The issue arises when a list key is passed to the function, causing the function to incorrectly handle the indexing operation and raise a KeyError.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates the incorrect behavior when a list key is used to index a Series, resulting in a KeyError that is not expected.
4. To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to correctly handle list indexers similar to how array-like indexers are handled.
5. By modifying the conditional branches for handling different types of key inputs, the bug can be resolved.

## Fixing the Bug
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index))):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version includes a check for scalar keys or list-like keys that are not arrays, Series, or Index objects to be processed using `loc` instead of raising a KeyError. This change ensures consistent behavior for all types of key inputs and resolves the issue identified in the failing test case.
