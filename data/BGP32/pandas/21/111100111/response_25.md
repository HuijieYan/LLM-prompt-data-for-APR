After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test case, it appears that the issue stems from the way list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers. The failing test case expects consistent behavior for all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when accessing elements in a Series object. However, the buggy function `_get_with` does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError in the failing test case.

To fix this bug and make the function behave consistently for all indexers, we can update the conditional block for list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The key is to treat list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now handles list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case provided.
