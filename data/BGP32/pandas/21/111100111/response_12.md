## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key input, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc. However, the issue arises when dealing with a list input in the form of key = Series(["C"], dtype=object) which is converted to a list using box(key). This conversion does not align with the logic in the `_get_with` function.
2. The bug is causing a KeyError when a list indexer is used, showing inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers.
3. Based on the failing test case, the expected behavior is that the result should be NaN for non-matching values in the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code logic to handle list indexer input correctly and align it with the expected behavior. Specifically, we should handle the case where a list indexer is not found in the index by returning NaN for the non-matching values.

## Bug Fix Implementation

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            return np.nan
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check for non-matching values in the index and returning NaN for those cases, we ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected outcome for list indexers. This fix should address the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test case.
