#### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. When an indexer that is a list is passed to the function, it fails to handle the case properly, resulting in a KeyError. The existing code treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistency in behavior.

In the failing test case, a series containing the value "C" is passed as an indexer wrapped in various array-like structures (list, np.array, Index, Series). The test expects consistent behavior, but the current implementation results in a KeyError when a list indexer is encountered.

The expected behavior should be that all array-like structures passed as indexers should behave consistently. The current code fails to handle list indexers correctly.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all array-like indexers regardless of their specific type (list, np.array, Index, Series). The key is to properly handle list indexers to prevent the KeyError and align the behavior with other array-like structures.

#### Corrected Version of the Bug Fix
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list indexers by converting them to a list
    key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Ensure consistent handling of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fixed version of the `_get_with` function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass without encountering a KeyError when using a list indexer. The behavior will now be consistent across different types of array-like indexers.
