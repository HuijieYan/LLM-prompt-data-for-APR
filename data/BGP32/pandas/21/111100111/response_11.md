### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object.
2. The issue arises when a list-like key input is provided, leading to a KeyError during indexing.
3. The failing test aims to check the behavior of indexing with different types of inputs like list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
4. The expected behavior should align with the test cases where all types of inputs should exhibit consistent indexing behavior.
5. The key_type is being inferred as "integer" in the buggy function, which causes the error when dealing with a non-integer key like the provided list.
6. The bug was raised as a GitHub issue, questioning the inconsistency in behavior based on different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the key_type inference logic to handle non-integer keys correctly.
2. Ensure that indexing behavior is consistent across all types of input keys like list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):  # Handling list-like keys
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):  # Updated to handle non-integer keys
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the key_type check to include "mixed-integer" as well and ensuring that non-integer keys are handled correctly, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide consistent behavior for all types of key inputs.
