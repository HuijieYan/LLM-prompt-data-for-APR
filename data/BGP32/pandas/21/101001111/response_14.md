### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The issue is related to the handling of different types of indexing values. It fails to correctly handle indexing using list-like objects and raises an error in certain scenarios.

### Error Location:
The problematic part of the code is where it checks for `is_list_like(key)` and then tries to convert `key` into a list causing unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When `key` is not recognized as a scalar and `is_list_like(key)` is true, it tries to convert `key` into a list.
2. This handling can lead to issues when dealing with indexers that are not directly convertible to a list (e.g., Index objects).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the indexing operation is consistent across different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, Index objects, and scalars.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function modifies the handling of different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior. Now, the function should work correctly with list-like objects, arrays, Index objects, and scalars, addressing the issue outlined in the GitHub bug report.
