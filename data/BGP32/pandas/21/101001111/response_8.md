### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` receives a key for indexing, but depending on the key type, it may encounter issues.
2. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index`, causing an inconsistency in how the key is handled compared to other types like lists or arrays.
3. The function incorrectly infers the type of the key, which results in the wrong outcome during indexing operations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. Case 1: When `key` is a list `['C']`, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'`, leading to the wrong type assignment.
2. Case 2: With `key` as an array, the same issue arises, causing the incorrect assignment of `key_type`.
3. Case 3: When `key` is an `Index`, the function fails to handle it correctly due to the wrong inference of `key_type`.
4. Case 4: Even when `key` is a Series, the incorrect handling is observed due to the flawed logic in determining `key_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to:
1. Correctly identify the type of the `key` and handle each type consistently.
2. Ensure that the `key_type` determination is accurate.
3. Address the inconsistency in indexing with `Index` objects compared to other types like lists or arrays.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the logic related to handling different key types and ensuring accurate type inference, the function now behaves consistently and should address the issue reported on GitHub.
