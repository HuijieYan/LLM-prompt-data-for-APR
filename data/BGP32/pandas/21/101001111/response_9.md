### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas handles various types of indexers differently, leading to inconsistencies in behavior. Specifically, when the key is a list-like object, the function should return the corresponding values following standard indexing conventions. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

Analyzing the runtime values and expected values from the failing tests, we see that in all cases, the `key_type` is identified as `'string'`, irrespective of the type of key provided. This implies that the logic to infer the type of key within the function is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Case 1:** 
   - The function incorrectly identifies the type of `key` as a string, which does not correspond to the actual list provided.
   
2. **Case 2:**
   - Similar to Case 1, the inference of `key_type` is incorrect even when `key` is passed as an ndarray.

3. **Case 3:**
   - In this case, although `key` is an Index type containing strings, the inferred `key_type` remains as a string, leading to incorrect processing.

4. **Case 4:**
   - The function incorrectly assumes a string type for the key, causing issues with correct indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to:
- Correctly infer the type of `key` to handle list-like indexers appropriately.
- Ensure that the behavior is consistent with indexing logic for different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now correctly differentiates between the different types of indexers and ensures that the key is appropriately inferred for handling list-like indexers. This fix aims to resolve the inconsistencies in indexing behavior encountered in the provided test cases and aligns the function's logic with standard pandas indexing conventions.
