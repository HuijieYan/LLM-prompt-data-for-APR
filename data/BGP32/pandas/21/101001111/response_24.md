Based on the analysis provided above, we can identify the main issue in the `_get_with` function. The problem arises when the key type is a list, and the function tries to handle it incorrectly based on its assumptions. To address this issue, we need to ensure that the function handles list type keys properly without causing errors or returning incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version explicitly checks for list-like input keys and handles them correctly by using the `loc` method to access the elements in the Series. By ensuring an appropriate response to list keys, we prevent errors and guarantee that the function behaves consistently in all cases.

The corrected function should now align with the expected input/output values and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post regarding inconsistencies in dealing with different types of indexers.
