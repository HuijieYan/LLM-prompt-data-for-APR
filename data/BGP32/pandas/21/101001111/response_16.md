### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling the key parameter for indexing a Series. The issue arises when the key is not list-like and not recognized as an array or a Series. The current implementation mistakenly tries to access the `key` directly using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError when the key is not present in the index. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors when indexing with various data types.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to revise the handling of non-list-like keys within the `_get_with` function. Instead of trying to directly use `self.loc[key]`, we should adjust the logic to handle these cases more consistently with the behavior described in the GitHub issue. By referencing the index type and distinguishing between index types like lists, NumPy arrays, and Series, we can provide a more robust indexing mechanism.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # Convert slice to ensure consistency
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle non-list-like cases
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    # Determine the key type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Handle integer key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide between positional and label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle list key type
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Reindex for other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that non-list-like keys are treated consistently and providing appropriate indexing mechanisms based on the key type, this corrected version of the function resolves the bug and aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
