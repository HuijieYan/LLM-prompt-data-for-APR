### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The potential error lies in the type handling logic, specifically in the checks for different key types and how they are processed.
3. Based on the runtime and expected variable values, it seems that the key_type is incorrectly inferred as 'string' in all cases, which indicates a flaw in the logic for determining the key type.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of different key types and correct inference of the key type to select the appropriate indexing method.
5. The correction involves refining the key type inference and updating the indexing logic based on the detected key type.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "list-like":
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type

        if key_type == "object":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction includes updating the key type inference logic and adjusting the indexing based on the inferred key type. By detecting the key type correctly, the function can choose the appropriate indexing method for the input key, resolving the issue with inconsistent behavior based on the key type.
