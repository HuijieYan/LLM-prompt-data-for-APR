### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a list key that has no matches, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other array-like indexers such as NumPy arrays or Index. The bug arises from the implementation in the `_get_with` function with the logic that handles different types of key indexers. When processing a list key, the function incorrectly uses `loc` instead of raising a KeyError. This behavior deviates from the expected behavior and causes issues as indicated in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug and address the inconsistency raised in the GitHub issue, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list keys without matches correctly by raising a KeyError. This change aligns the behavior with other array-like indexers in Pandas.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            result = self.loc[key]
            if result.empty:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return result
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the provided correction, the `_get_with` function now handles list keys with no matches as expected, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
