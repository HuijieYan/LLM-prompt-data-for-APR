## Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library aims to retrieve values based on different types of keys provided. The bug arises when the function encounters a key that is not recognized as valid for indexing the `Series`. This issue is related to how different indexers are handled inconsistently, as noted in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location
The bug occurs when the function encounters a key that is not recognized as a valid index, resulting in wrongly inferring the `key_type` as `'string'`. This leads to incorrect indexing logic in subsequent conditional branches.

### Cause of the Bug
In all failing cases, the key provided is not recognized as a valid index structure, causing the function to infer a wrong type for the key (`key_type = 'string'`). This incorrect inference leads to the function choosing the wrong path in the following logic. The behavior observed in the provided test cases is due to the inconsistency in how different key structures are handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled for different types of indexers. We should aim to make the behavior consistent and align it with the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Function
I will modify the `_get_with` function to handle indexing with different key structures more consistently and align it with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Series):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected function, we ensure that the key is correctly converted to an index structure if needed and that the `key_type` inference is based on the actual structure of the key being used for indexing. This will make the function behavior more consistent and handle different key structures appropriately.
