### Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the discrepancy in handling list indexers and other array-like indexers, causing incorrect behavior and potential KeyError exceptions when using list key types in the Series `_get_with` method. The existing logic does not appropriately handle list indexers, leading to unexpected outcomes and issues.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure consistent treatment of list indexers with other array-like indexers and improve the handling of different key types in the `_get_with` method. By refining the conditional checks and index handling, we can address the inconsistencies and prevent errors like the KeyError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index key types are handled uniformly and appropriately within the `_get_with` function. By converting the key to an index type before further processing, the function can handle different key types consistently and prevent potential errors.
