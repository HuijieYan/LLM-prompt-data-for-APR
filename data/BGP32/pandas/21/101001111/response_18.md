## Analysis

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing the series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys, as indicated in the GitHub issue `API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]`.
3. The bug appears to be due to the incorrect processing of list-like keys causing inconsistent behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of key inputs are handled consistently, especially in the case of list-like keys.
5. The corrected version should address the inconsistency and ensure that all key types are handled correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy

1. Check the type of the key input and handle list-like keys in a consistent manner.
2. Ensure that list-like keys are processed properly to avoid the inconsistent behavior described in the GitHub issue.
3. Update the logic to handle key types such as lists, numpy arrays, and Index objects uniformly to prevent the KeyError issue.
4. Make necessary adjustments to the code to align with the expected behavior based on the issue description.
5. Implement the corrective changes in the `_get_with` function to resolve the bug and maintain consistency in key processing.

## Bug-fixed Version

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # When the key is not integer or list, reindex the series
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys and ensuring consistent treatment of different key types, the corrected function should address the bug described in the GitHub issue and maintain the expected behavior across various key inputs.
