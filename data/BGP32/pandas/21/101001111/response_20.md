Analyzing the buggy function `_get_with`, we can see that the issue arises due to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically list-like indexers. The function attempts to determine the type of the key input and act accordingly, but the logic for list-like keys is causing inconsistencies.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when the key is not recognized as list-like, the function attempts to access the location directly using `self.loc[key]`, which leads to issues with how list-like keys are handled, especially if they don't match the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling different types of indexers, particularly for list-like keys. We should ensure that the function behaves consistently for all types of keys and properly handles the case where the key is not present in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys properly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of list-like keys, ensuring that all indexers are treated consistently and appropriately whether they are list-like or other types. This should resolve the issue described and ensure proper functionality for all types of indexers.
