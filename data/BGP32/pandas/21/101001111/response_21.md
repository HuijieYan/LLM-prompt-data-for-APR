### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing for a Pandas Series. The cases provided reveal that there is an inconsistency between how list indexers and array-like indexers are treated. The issue stems from the fact that list indexers do not behave consistently with array-like indexers.

### Potential Error Location:
The inconsistency lies in the handling of different types of indexers like lists, arrays, and Index objects. The key_type determination and the subsequent decision on how to index based on the inferred type seem to be faulty.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug occurs because the handling of indexing for the different key types like list, ndarray, Index is not consistent. 
2. The `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition is incorrect because it doesn't cover all the cases leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers, including list, array-like, and Index objects.
2. Check the type of the key correctly to determine the appropriate indexing method.

### Correction:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making the necessary corrections and ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers, the bug in the `_get_with` function is fixed. This revised version should align with the expected input/output values and resolve the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
