### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object. Based on the provided information, there are issues related to the handling of string indexers and inconsistency in behavior compared to other indexers. The key issue seems to be with how the function handles the input key when it is not list-like.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1 and Case 2, when the key is a list, ndarray, or an Index, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`. This misidentification leads to improper handling of the key, resulting in unexpected behavior.

2. In Case 4, when the key is a Series object, it is incorrectly treated as a string. This incorrect handling results in the wrong behavior when retrieving the values using the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the key type inference is done correctly for different types of input keys. By identifying the key type accurately, we can then handle the key appropriately to retrieve the desired values from the Series object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary:
- The corrected function now properly handles different types of keys and infers their type accurately to determine the appropriate retrieval method from the Series object.
- By addressing the issue of misidentification of key types, the function should now behave consistently and retrieve the values as expected based on the provided input keys.
