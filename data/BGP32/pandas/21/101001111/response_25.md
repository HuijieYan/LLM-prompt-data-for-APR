### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function due to incorrect handling of different types of indexers. The function fails to properly handle list-like indexers, which results in unexpected behavior and inconsistencies compared to other types of indexers like `Index`, `ndarray`, and `Series`.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the block that checks whether the passed `key` is list-like or not. It incorrectly treats list-like keys differently, leading to the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes inconsistencies when trying to index a Series using a list-like key as compared to other types of keys like `Index` or `ndarray`. This inconsistency results in unexpected errors or behaviors, as observed in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers such as `Index`, `ndarray`, or `Series`. By modifying the block that checks for list-like keys, we can resolve this inconsistency and align the behavior with the expected functionality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys consistently with other types
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)`, we can ensure that the `key` is handled consistently as an index, aligning the behavior with other types of indexers. This correction should resolve the bug and ensure consistent behavior for list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.
