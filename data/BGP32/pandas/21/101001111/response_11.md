### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The function is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. However, the bug causes incorrect handling of key types, specifically when dealing with a list-like key input.

#### Bug Description
The bug arises when a list-like key input is encountered. Instead of properly handling the list key and returning the corresponding values, the function incorrectly extracts the key_type as a string in all cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys within the function. We should correctly distinguish list key inputs and handle them accordingly without misinterpreting the key type. By ensuring the proper identification and processing of list-like keys, we can address the issue and align with the expected behavior for indexing a Series.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By specifically addressing the handling of list-like keys with `is_list_like(key)` and avoiding misinterpretation of the key type, we have corrected the bug in the `_get_with` function. This corrected version aligns with the expected behavior for indexing a Series object and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
