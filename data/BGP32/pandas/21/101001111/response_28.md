### Exploring the Bug
The buggy function `_get_with` is encountering issues when dealing with different types of key inputs, particularly when handling string keys. The bug is causing unexpected outputs when attempting to slice, leading to incorrect key type assignments.

### Bug Analysis
The root cause of the bug appears to be the mishandling of key types, especially in the case of string keys. The function is incorrectly categorizing string keys as `'integer'`, which prompts the function to attempt positional indexing instead of locational indexing, leading to incorrect outputs for string key inputs.

### Correction Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly recognizes the type of the key input and performs the appropriate indexing operation. Specifically, we need to adjust the logic related to string key types to correctly utilize locational indexing instead of positional indexing to ensure consistency in handling different key types.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and the expected behavior described:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures correct indexing for various key types, especially string keys. It resolves the bug by adjusting the logic related to different key types and ensuring consistent behavior across all key input scenarios.
