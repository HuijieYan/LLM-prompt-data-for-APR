### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas has a bug related to how different types of indexers are handled.
2. The issue focuses on the inconsistency in treating indexers differently, especially when using a list indexer.
3. The bug arises when the key is not recognized as a list-like object or a positional indexer, leading to an incorrect handling of the key, which results in an incorrect return value.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently.
5. The corrected version of the function should appropriately handle the key based on its type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Recognize the type of the key and handle it accordingly.
2. Ensure consistent treatment of different key types.
3. Update the logic to handle key type as list-like to avoid the bug.
4. Implement the fix considering the expectations and requirements of each case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
      
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, especially when the key is list-like. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and aligns the function's behavior with the expected input/output values provided for each test case.
