Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers within a Series object. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when attempting to use a list indexer. 

To resolve this issue and fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled appropriately within the `_get_with` function to prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Ensure key is converted to a list
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle when key is a list
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The changes made involve converting the `key` to a list if it is not already a list before checking the key type. This modification ensures that list indexers are processed correctly within the `_get_with` function, resolving the KeyError issue when using list indexers.

This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
