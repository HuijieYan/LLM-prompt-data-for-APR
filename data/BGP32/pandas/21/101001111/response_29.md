### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers passed to a Series object.
2. The function checks for the type of indexer (`key`) and performs specific actions based on the type.
3. The bug might be related to how the function is handling different types of indexers, potentially leading to incorrect outcomes.
4. The runtime input/output values suggest that the function is not correctly identifying the type of key, resulting in unexpected outcomes during execution.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the function incorrectly identifying the type of the key passed to it. This incorrect identification leads to the wrong actions being taken, resulting in unexpected outcomes. In the cases mentioned:
- The key `['C']` should be correctly recognized as a list but is being interpreted as a string.
- Similarly, the key `array(['C'], dtype=object)` should be identified as an ndarray but is possibly being misclassified.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key being passed. This involves updating the conditional checks to properly handle different types of indexers to align with the expected behaviors.

### Correction:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making the above corrections, the function should now correctly handle different types of indexers and produce the expected outcomes for the given test cases.
