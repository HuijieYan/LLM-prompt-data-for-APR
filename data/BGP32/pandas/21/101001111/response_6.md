### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. The issue arises when the `key` parameter is a list-like object that does not match any values in the series index. The current implementation incorrectly handles different types of `key` inputs, leading to unexpected behaviors.

In the in-depth analysis:
- Case 1, Case 2, and Case 4 involve scenarios where the `key` input is a list or ndarray that fails to match any index values in the series.
- The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as a string in these cases, affecting the path of execution within the function and resulting in incorrect returns.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To address the bug, we need to ensure that the correct type of the `key` parameter is identified to handle non-matching cases appropriately. By accurately determining the type of the key and distinguishing list-like objects that do not match any index values, the function can avoid errors and provide consistent behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis and bug explanation, here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) or (is_object_dtype(self.dtype) and not is_list_like(key)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_categorical_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key.codes]
    elif is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)

```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by correctly handling different types of `key` inputs, identifying scalars, extension array types, and ensuring proper indexing for non-matching cases. By incorporating these changes, the function maintains consistent behavior and resolves the issue identified in the GitHub problem description.
