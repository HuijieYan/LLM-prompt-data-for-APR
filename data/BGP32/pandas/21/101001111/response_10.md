This bug seems to arise from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in pandas.

Looking at the buggy function with the provided runtime and expected values, it is evident that the issue lies in distinguishing between different types of key inputs and handling them appropriately. The bug can be attributed to the conditional check for `is_list_like(key)` where it branches into different behaviors based on key types. In Cases 1, 2, and 3, the key is not recognized as an array-like type due to the condition `not is_list_like(key)`, leading to incorrect behavior in assigning `key_type` and choosing the indexing method.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the conditions for handling different key types more accurately and consistently. We must ensure that all valid key types are appropriately recognized and processed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This revised code should handle various types of keys correctly by recognizing array-like types and processing them appropriately. It aligns with the expected input/output values and addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
