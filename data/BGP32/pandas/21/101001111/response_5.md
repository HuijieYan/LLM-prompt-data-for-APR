### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When the key variable is not recognized as a list-like data structure, the function attempts to access the key directly using `.loc`, assuming it's a valid key for indexing. This leads to an incorrect handling of non-list-like keys that should be treated differently.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly differentiate between different types of key inputs and handle them accordingly. Specifically, when the key is not list-like, we should handle it based on its type to avoid incorrect indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Handle different types of keys appropriately
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing")
```

This corrected version handles different key types separately, ensuring correct indexing behavior for each case and avoiding the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
