The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers, especially when a list-like key is provided. The function does not properly handle the case when a list index is passed. This issue is related to a GitHub issue regarding inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

The key error is mainly from the handling of list-like keys, especially when using `loc` which raises an error. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles list-like keys to avoid such errors.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of list-like keys by converting them to a list if necessary and then performing the required operations based on the key type. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.
