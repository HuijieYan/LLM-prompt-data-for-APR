### Bug Analysis
1. The `key_type` variable is determined based on the type of the `key` input parameter, which is incorrect in the failing tests due to a mismatch in the expected values and types.
2. The conditions inside the function to handle different key types are not correctly distinguishing between different types of key inputs, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The issue arises from the function not handling the case where a single element key is passed and processed incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the conditions to correctly identify the type of the `key` input parameter and handle single-element keys appropriately.
2. Ensure that the `key` is processed and converted to the correct type before type evaluation.
3. Update the comparison logic for different key types to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError
    
    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e., self.iloc) or label-based (i.e., self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now handles different types of `key` inputs correctly and aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.
