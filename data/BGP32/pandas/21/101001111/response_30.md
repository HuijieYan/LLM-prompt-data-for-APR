After analyzing the buggy function and the provided runtime values and expected values, it seems that the issue lies in how the key is being processed within the `_get_with` function. The function fails to handle the case where the key is a list-like object properly, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Update the code to properly handle list-like key objects by converting them to a list.
2. Ensure that the key is checked for being a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index before proceeding with the logic to determine the key_type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now properly handles list-like keys and ensures that the key is converted to a list before further processing. This fix should resolve the issue raised in the GitHub post and ensure consistent behavior when indexing with various data structures.
