### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The issue on GitHub highlights a discrepancy in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers.
3. The bug causes inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with array-like indexers to maintain uniform behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior of array-like indexers.
2. Ensure that list indexers are processed in a way that aligns with the intended behavior for indexing a Series.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check to handle list indexers the same way as Index-like objects for indexing a Series.
2. Adjusted the logic to ensure list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers.
3. Updated the function to maintain uniform behavior when indexing a Series.
