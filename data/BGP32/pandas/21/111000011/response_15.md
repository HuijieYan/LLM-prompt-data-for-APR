### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` module is responsible for handling different types of key inputs and returning the appropriate values accordingly.
- The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently compared to other types of indexers like array-like or index-based. This inconsistency is causing unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.
- The issue description highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers, leading to KeyError in some cases.

### Bug:
The bug is related to the inconsistent behavior of treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in the same way as other array-like or index-based indexers to maintain consistency in the behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle all types of indexers in a consistent manner
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Handle list indexers similar to array-like indexers
        if key_type == 'object':
            key = np.asarray(key)

        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers similar to other array-like indexers like numpy arrays, ensuring consistency in how different types of indexers are treated in the `_get_with` function.
