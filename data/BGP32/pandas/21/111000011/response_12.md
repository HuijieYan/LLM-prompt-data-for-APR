## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values.
2. The bug seems to be related to how list-like key indexers are handled, as mentioned in the GitHub issue, where indexing with a list that contains no matches throws an error.
3. The bug occurs when handling list-like key indexers due to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like key indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for handling list-like key indexers to align with how array-like indexers are handled.
2. Ensure that the proper error checking and handling are in place to prevent the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
   
## Bug Fixed Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        new_key = key.copy()
        deduped_key = [x for i, x in enumerate(new_key) if x not in new_key[:i]]  # Remove duplicates
        if deduped_key != key:  # If duplicates were found
            index = ensure_index(deduped_key)
            return self.reindex(index)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list-like key indexers equivalently to array-like indexers, we can ensure the consistent behavior of the function and address the issue reported on GitHub.
