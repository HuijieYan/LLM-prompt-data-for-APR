### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is used to handle different types of indexers for a Series object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
- The issue reported on GitHub points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.
- The specific concern is related to handling of missing items when indexing a Series with a list that doesn't match any values, which results in different behavior compared to other types of indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The handling of list indexers and the subsequent return statements based on the type of key provided.
- The logic for checking the key type and inferring the data type of the key.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the inconsistent behavior of how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected results when indexing a Series with lists that don't match any values, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, we should address the inconsistency related to list indexers to align with the behavior of array-like indexers. This will involve modifying the logic for list indexers to match the desired behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Based on the GitHub issue and the bug analysis, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # List-like indexers
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle case where key is a list with no matches
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.reindex(key)

        # Handle all other list indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Scalar indexers
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently, including the case where the list has no matches. By updating the logic for list indexers, the function aligns with the expected behavior indicated in the GitHub issue.
