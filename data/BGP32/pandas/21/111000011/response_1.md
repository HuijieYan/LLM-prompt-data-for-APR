### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are being handled compared to other array-like indexers, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
2. Possible inconsistency in the behavior of handling different types of indexers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent behavior of handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected errors, especially when dealing with list indexers that contain no matches in the Series index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to address the error related to list indexers that contain no matches in the Series index.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue described in the GitHub problem statement:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        if not self.index.isin(key).any():
            return self.reindex([])

        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if not self.loc[key].empty:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled appropriately, especially when there are no matches in the Series index. It provides a consistent behavior for different types of indexers as requested in the GitHub issue.
