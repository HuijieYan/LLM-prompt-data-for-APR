### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for indexing a Series object based on the type of the key provided. The bug seems to stem from inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers, especially when dealing with a list key that has no matches. This bug is related to GitHub issue #5880, where inconsistencies in indexing behavior with list indexers were reported.

### Error Location:
The error in handling list keys that have no matches is likely located in the `elif not is_list_like(key)` block of the `_get_with(key)` function. This block tries to return values using `self.loc[key]`, which can raise errors when there are no matches in the index.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with(key)` function. Specifically, the error occurs when dealing with list-like keys that have no matches in the index. This behavior differs from how other indexers are handled and can lead to unexpected errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the handling of list-like keys that have no matches should be made consistent with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that a more robust check is performed before attempting to extract values based on the list key.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

            if isinstance(key, list):
                return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added a more explicit check for list-like keys before attempting to extract values using `self.loc[key]`. If a KeyError is raised due to no matches in the index, the function falls back to reindexing the Series based on the key provided. This change ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers in the `_get_with(key)` function.
