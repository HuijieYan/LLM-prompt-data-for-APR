### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for the `Series` class.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, specifically focusing on the behavior when using a list indexer.
3. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers, causing unexpected behavior and raising KeyErrors in some cases.
4. The bug occurs when attempting to access elements using a list indexer, which leads to inconsistencies compared to other types of indexers.
5. The bug needs to be fixed to ensure consistent and expected behavior across all types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with(key)` function of the `Series` class. When a list indexer is passed, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. Specifically, the function should properly handle list indexers to avoid KeyErrors and maintain expected behavior.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Bug Fix Explanation:
The corrected code now ensures that list indexers are properly handled within the `_get_with(key)` function. By converting the key to a list and checking for various types of indexers before proceeding, the function now maintains consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This fix addresses the reported inconsistency and should prevent KeyErrors when using list indexers.
