### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers. The function checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or any other type of indexer and takes appropriate action based on the type.

The GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in the behavior when indexing a `Series` object using a list key. The issue suggests that indexing with a list should behave similarly to indexing with other array-like objects, but currently, it raises a `KeyError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
The error in the current implementation could be due to the handling of list indexers differently from other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of indexing when using a list key, leading to a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` for missing values. This inconsistency might be due to different pathways being taken for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent way with other types of indexers. By ensuring that indexing with a list key behaves correctly and consistently with array-like objects, we can fix the bug.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = "list"

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Handle integer keys
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that a list key is properly converted to an `Index` object using `ensure_index` to maintain consistency with other array-like objects. Additionally, we infer the `key_type` based on the type of object passed as the key. This modification should address the issue and provide a consistent behavior when indexing a `Series` object with different types of indexers.
