### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method within the `Series` class in pandas.
- The function is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a `Series`.
- The GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically between list indexers and other array-like indexers.
- The issue mentions that using `ser[pd.Index(key)]` or `ser[np.array(key)]` produces the same result as `ser[list(key)]`, but the latter results in a `KeyError`.
- The `Series` class contains various methods related to indexing, such as `__getitem__`, but the behavior is inconsistent due to different handling of list indexers.

### Error Location:
- The error is likely related to the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- The issue seems to stem from the specific case of using a list key to index the `Series`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the `_get_with` function when dealing with list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
- The function should handle list indexers in a similar way to other types of indexers to maintain consistency.
- The current implementation results in a `KeyError` when indexing with a list, which is not the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.
- We should ensure that indexing with a list key produces the expected output without raising a `KeyError`.
- It may involve adjusting the conditional statements and the logic for different types of keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
- Modified the condition to handle both lists and numpy arrays together.
- Combined the check for `list` and `np.ndarray` into the same conditional block to ensure consistent handling of array-like indexers.
- This change should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that indexing with a list key behaves the same as other array-like indexers.
