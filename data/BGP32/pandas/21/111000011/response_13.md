## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object. The bug relates to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The bug causes a KeyError when using a list indexer, while other types of indexers do not raise an error.

## Potential error locations:
1. The handling of list indexers in the block of code checking if `key` is not list-like.
2. The conversion of `key` to a list in the block of code checking if `key` is not list-like.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the discrepancy in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is encountered, the code attempts to convert it to a list and then tries to reindex the Series using the list. This results in a KeyError because the list indexer is not present in the Series object's index.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. We can adjust the logic to avoid converting list indexers to a list and revising the reindexing approach for list indexers to match the behavior of array-like indexers.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers by directly checking if the key is present in the Series object's index before attempting to reindex. This aligns the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers being used in the function.
