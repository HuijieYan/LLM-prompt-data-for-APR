## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series object. The bug seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

## Error Locations:
1. The condition `if not is_list_like(key)` might not be correctly identifying list indexers.
2. The handling of different key types within the function seems to be leading to the issue.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly distinguishing between list indexers and other types of indexers, leading to incorrect behavior when indexing the Series object with a list that contains no matches.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in handling list indexers within the `_get_with` function. This involves correctly identifying list indexers and ensuring consistent behavior when indexing the Series object.

## Corrected Version:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Removed handling of list indexers and directly reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles list indexers by converting them to a list when needed and directly reindexes the Series object when dealing with a list indexer. This ensures consistent behavior when indexing the Series object with different types of indexers.
