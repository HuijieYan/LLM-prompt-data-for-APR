### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexes when accessing data from a `Series`.
2. The GitHub issue highlights a specific inconsistency related to how a list indexer is treated differently compared to other types of indexers.
3. The issue arises when using a list indexer that contains no matching elements within the series, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.
4. The buggy function does not handle the case of a list indexer with no matches correctly, resulting in the error described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the function not correctly handling the scenario where a list indexer does not have any matching elements in the series. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised instead of handling the case gracefully.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to properly handle the situation where a list indexer contains no matching elements. We can modify the conditional statements to check for this case specifically and return a suitable result without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Handle the case when key is a list with no matches
        if isinstance(key, list) and not any(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.reindex(key)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a specific check for the case where `key` is a list and none of its elements are present in the series index. This check ensures that the function handles this scenario gracefully by calling `reindex` with the `key`.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and improve the robustness of the `_get_with` function in handling different types of indexers.
