### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for indexing a Series object based on different types of keys. The function contains multiple conditional blocks to handle different key types, including slices, ABCDataFrame, tuples, and non-list-like keys.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The handling of non-list-like keys seems to be causing issues based on the GitHub issue description.
2. There might be inconsistency in how different types of keys are handled, leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Cause of the bug:
Based on the GitHub issue, the behavior of indexing using a list key in the `Series` class is different from indexing using other types of keys like slices, ABCDataFrame, tuples, etc. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected errors and behavior. The bug seems to stem from the conditional block that handles non-list-like keys.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different key types, especially when using a list key. The fix should address the reported inconsistency in indexing behaviors with different key types mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, when handling non-list-like keys, we explicitly check if the key is not list-like and not a tuple before using the `loc` method for indexing. This change should help address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue related to different behaviors when indexing with list-like keys.
