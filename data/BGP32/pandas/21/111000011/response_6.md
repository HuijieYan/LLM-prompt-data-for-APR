### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and others. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers. When a list indexer is used, it's not handling the case properly, leading to an error.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to arise when dealing with list indexers in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block in the `_get_with` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `key` is a list, it is being incorrectly handled in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block. The implementation to handle list indexers is causing an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. We should update the implementation to properly process the list indexers and prevent the error mentioned in the GitHub issue. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Fixed handling of list indexers
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers correctly based on the provided fix strategy. It ensures that the bug reported in the GitHub issue is addressed and resolved appropriately.
