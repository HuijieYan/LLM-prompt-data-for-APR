### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for indexing operations on a Series object. The bug occurs due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers (list indexers vs. array-like indexers). The bug is related to an issue on GitHub titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]", where the behavior of indexing with a list is inconsistent with other types of indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling list-like keys.
2. The type checking for different types of keys.
3. Decision making based on the key type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in different behaviors when indexing with a list compared to other index types. The bug leads to an incorrect key not being found in the index, causing a KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling for all types of indexers (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index). By aligning the behavior to handle list-like keys correctly, we can avoid the KeyError and provide a consistent indexing behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the 
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This fix addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and should resolve the KeyError that occurs when indexing with a list.
