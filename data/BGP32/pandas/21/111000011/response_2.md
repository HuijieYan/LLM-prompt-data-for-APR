### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for selecting values from the `Series` object based on the input `key`.
- The bug seems to be related to handling different types of indexers (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`) differently. This behavior inconsistency results in errors when using a list indexer.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the handling of different types of indexers inconsistently within the `_get_with` function.
- Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently than other types of indexers, leading to errors when using list indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.
- The fix should aim to address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and ensure that list indexers are handled correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Corrected handling of key_type
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Deciding whether to treat this as positional or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Updated to handle list indexers consistently
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now ensures consistent handling of all types of indexers, specifically addressing the issue related to list indexers highlighted in the GitHub issue. By making these adjustments, the function should now behave consistently and avoid errors related to index selections in the `Series` object.
