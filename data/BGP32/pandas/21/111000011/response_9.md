## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` module is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, etc. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexers of type `list`. The function checks whether the type of the key is `list`, and then processes it accordingly. However, the function is not handling the case where a `list` key has no matches within the index properly.

## Identified Bug:
The bug seems to arise when the function encounters a `list` key that does not have any matches within the index. As mentioned in the GitHub issue, the behavior differs for list indexers compared to other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent and unexpected errors.

## Root Cause:
The root cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistent handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function. When a `list` key does not have any matches within the index, it leads to a `KeyError`, indicating that none of the elements in the `list` are found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

## Proposed Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of `list` indexers is consistent with the handling of other types of indexers. The function should not raise a `KeyError` when a `list` key has no matches within the index but should handle this case gracefully.

## Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if key_type := lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False) == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when the key is a `list`, we first check if any elements in the `list` are not present in the index. If that is the case, we call `reindex` to handle the situation gracefully. If all elements are present in the index, we proceed with `loc` to fetch the corresponding values.

This approach ensures that the function handles `list` indexers consistently with other types of indexers and resolves the bug related to unexpected `KeyError` when a `list` key has no matches within the index.
