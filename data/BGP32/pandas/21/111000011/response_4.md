## Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling various types of indexers and fetching values based on the provided key. The function checks the type of the key and takes different actions accordingly.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The function differentiates handling between list-like indexers and other types of indexers.
2. The function attempts to handle different types of key inputs including scalars and index objects.
3. There might be an issue in the logic when dealing with a list-like key input.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series. In particular, the reported bug is related to how a list indexer is processed compared to other types of array-like indexers. The error message raised in the GitHub issue indicates that the list indexer case is not handled correctly and results in a KeyError.

The issue stems from the logic within the `_get_with(key)` function where the treatment of list indexes is not consistent with other array-like indexers, leading to the observed error.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list-like indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers. Specifically, the function should correctly process list indexers to avoid the KeyError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or (is_instance(key, Index) and key.empty):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handling the list indexers and making it consistent with other types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is added to handle the case where the key is not list-like or when the key is an empty Index object. This change ensures that list indexers are processed without raising any errors and maintains consistency with the treatment of other array-like indexers.
