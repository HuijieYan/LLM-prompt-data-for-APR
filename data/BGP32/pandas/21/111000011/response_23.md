## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for indexing operations in a pandas Series.
- The function checks for different types of indexers including slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Index objects.
- The issue reported on GitHub discusses the inconsistency in behavior between using a list indexer and other types of indexers when accessing a pandas Series.

## Error Locations:
- The issue arises when dealing with list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- The current implementation treats list indexers differently which causes inconsistencies and raises errors in some cases.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because when a list-like indexer is passed to the Series, the behavior is different from that of other types of indexers.
- The inconsistency is caused by the implementation in the `_get_with` function which handles list indexers differently.

## Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `_get_with` function to have consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
- The function should handle list-like indexers in a similar way to other indexers to avoid inconsistencies and errors.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Modify the handling of list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):  # Update this condition
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version above, the handling of list-like indexers has been updated to be consistent with other types of indexers. This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
