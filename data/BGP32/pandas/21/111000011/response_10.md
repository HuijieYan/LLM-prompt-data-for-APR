### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas module is intended to retrieve values based on the provided key. The issue arises when handling different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. The bug seems to be related to the handling of a list key, which is causing inconsistencies and errors when attempting to retrieve values.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Misinterpretation of the key type.
2. Inconsistent handling of different types of keys.
3. Lack of proper handling for list-like keys.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent and incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function fails to properly identify and process list keys, leading to errors and unexpected behavior when attempting to retrieve values based on a list key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, proper handling of list-like keys should be implemented in the `_get_with` function. This includes identifying list keys correctly, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of keys, and avoiding errors when retrieving values based on a list key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like keys and ensures consistent behavior across different types of keys. This fix addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to Series indexing inconsistencies, specifically when dealing with list keys.
