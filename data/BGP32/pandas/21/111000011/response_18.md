## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is not handling list indexers properly, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to array-like indexers. The function is trying to handle different types of indexers and is not correctly identifying list-like indexers which results in the bug.

## Identified Bug
The bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like indexer is passed, it should be treated correctly and not raise errors as observed in the GitHub issue.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the conditional check for list-like keys not working as intended. This results in incorrect handling of list indexers, leading to inconsistencies in behavior with array-like indexers.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are properly handled and that the function does not raise errors when processing them. We should update the conditional checks to correctly identify list-like keys and handle them accordingly.

## Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (List, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the conditional check for list-like keys using the `is_list_like()` function, which should correctly identify list indexers and handle them without raising errors. This fix should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
