### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is used to retrieve values based on the provided `key`.
2. The function handles different types of `key` inputs including slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalars, list-like, etc.
3. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. The issue arises when using `ser[list(key)]`, resulting in a KeyError that is not consistent with other cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by inconsistency in the handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers when accessing values in the `Series`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers. The code logic for processing list indexers should be adjusted to match the behavior expected based on the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list indexers consistent with other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, list):
        if isinstance(self.index, Index):
            if all(self.index.get_loc(k, -1) == -1 for k in key):
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        elif self.index.is_unique and not self.index.is_monotonic_increasing:
            indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
            if np.all(indexer == -1):
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]        

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now handles list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers in the `Series` class based on the provided information. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub related to the inconsistency in index handling.
