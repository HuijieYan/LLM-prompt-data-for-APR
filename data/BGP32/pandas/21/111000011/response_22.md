## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of the pandas module is causing an inconsistency issue when indexing with a list that contains no matches. The function is trying to handle various types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, and different array-like objects. Due to the conditional checks and conversions in the function, there is an issue specifically when dealing with list indexers that have no matches.

The error occurs because of the way list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers, leading to an inconsistency in behavior. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency when indexing a Series with a list containing no matches compared to other indexers.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the `key` is a list with no matches, the function attempts to index the Series with the list, leading to an error when trying to locate the non-existent elements.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` is a list with no matches, the behavior should be consistent with other array-like indexers and not raise an error. We can modify the function to handle the list case in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have made changes to ensure that when `key` is a list with no matches, it doesn't raise an error and behaves consistently with other array-like indexers. I have removed redundant checks and converted the `key` to a list when needed to handle the cases appropriately. This modification should address the inconsistency issue reported on GitHub.
