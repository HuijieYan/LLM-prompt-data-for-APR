### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate data.
- The issue reported on GitHub highlights inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when used with a `Series` object.
- The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list indexers
2. Determining the key type and deciding between `loc` and `iloc`
3. Reindexing

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs due to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers with a `Series` object.
- The `_get_with` function currently does not handle list indexers properly, leading to the bug reported on GitHub.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers.
- Ensure that all types of indexers return the appropriate data or raise consistent errors when necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type in ['object', 'boolean']:
        # Handle list-like indexers consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version of the function, I have modified the handling of list indexers to ensure they are treated consistently with other array-like indexers.
- Now, both list indexers and array-like indexers will return the appropriate data or raise errors consistently based on the type of indexer used.
- This fix aims to address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue related to indexing a `Series` object.
