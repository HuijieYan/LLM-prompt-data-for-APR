### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and series.
2. The error occurs when using a list indexer, leading to a `KeyError` that is not being raised as expected.
3. The GitHub issue highlights a discrepancy in behavior for different types of indexers, specifically mentioning the inconsistency with list indexers.
4. The bug seems to be related to the processing of list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.
5. The bug causes incorrect handling of list indexers, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to inconsistent handling of list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When a list indexer is encountered, it fails to handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the `_get_with` function to appropriately handle list indexers.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
1. Updated the logic to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers.
2. When `key` is list-like but not an instance of `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`, convert it to a list for further processing.
3. Simplified the handling of different types of indexers, ensuring `key` is correctly passed to either `self.loc` or `self.iloc` based on the inferred data type.
4. By making these changes, the corrected version resolves the inconsistency in handling list indexers and ensures that the `KeyError` issue is fixed.
