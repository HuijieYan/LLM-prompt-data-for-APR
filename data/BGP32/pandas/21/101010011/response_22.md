### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class does not handle the case where `key` is passed as a list. It treats lists differently from other array-like objects leading to inconsistent behavior.
2. The provided error messages highlight the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`) causing a `KeyError`.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that there is inconsistent behavior between different indexers, specifically how list indexers are treated differently compared to other array-like indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled the same way as other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function to maintain consistency. This will align with user expectations and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list indexers similar to other array-like indexers.
2. Ensure that the `_get_with` function's behavior aligns with user expectations and maintains consistent indexing logic for different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]  # Treat boolean indexers consistently with list-like indexers

    # Treat list indexers as other array-like objects
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle list indexers similar to array-like indexers
    
    return self.reindex(key)  # Default behavior for unknown indexers
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the inconsistency in handling list indexers will be resolved, and the corrected function will align with user expectations and maintain consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
