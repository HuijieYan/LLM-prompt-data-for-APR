### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is used for slicing and indexing operations in Pandas.
2. The error messages indicate that the test cases are failing when trying to access values using variations of indexers like list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.
3. The bug seems to be related to inconsistent behavior in handling indexers of different types (list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series).
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers and highlights the need for uniform handling.
5. The bug appears to be rooted in the conditional branching within the `_get_with` method, leading to incorrect indexing decisions based on the type of the indexer.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional checking based on the type of the indexer in the `_get_with` function. The function treats different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) differently, leading to inconsistent behavior and errors during indexing operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled uniformly within the `_get_with` function. We should streamline the logic to apply the same approach regardless of the indexer type.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that handles different types of indexers uniformly:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By simplifying the logic and ensuring that all types of indexers are treated consistently, the corrected function should address the bug and enable the failing test cases to pass.
