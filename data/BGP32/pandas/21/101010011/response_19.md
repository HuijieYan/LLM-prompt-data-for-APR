### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing issues when trying to index a `Series` object with different types of indexers like a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates a `KeyError` being raised when attempting to index with a list or other index types.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different types, with a specific focus on list indexers.
4. The bug occurs due to the handling of different indexer types within the `_get_with` function, leading to incorrect indexing and subsequent KeyError.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different indexer types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series, and handle the indexing appropriately.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
1. Updated the code to ensure that all indexer types are treated uniformly by converting them to an Index object using the `ensure_index` function.
2. Removed redundant conditions and improved type checking and inference to handle different types of indexers effectively.
3. By ensuring consistent handling of indexers across varying types, the bug causing `KeyError` issues when indexing with lists, ndarrays, Index, or Series is resolved.
