### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing.
2. The function contains a conditional check for various types of keys - slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list-like scalars, lists, Index, etc.
3. The bug arises with the handling of a key that is a list. The function tries to reindex the series based on the key, leading to a `KeyError` because it cannot find the items in the index.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list is used as a key, it behaves consistently with other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When trying to index with a list, it attempts to reindex the series but throws a `KeyError` because the items in the list are not found in the index.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when a list is used as a key, it doesn't lead to a `KeyError` by correcting the behavior to be consistent with other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        # Handle list-like indexing
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like keys in a consistent way by calling `_get_values_tuple` directly for list-like keys instead of trying to reindex the series. This change ensures that list indexing behaves similar to other array-like indexers and resolves the `KeyError` issue.
