### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases suggest that there is inconsistency in the behavior of how different indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are handled when passing a key that does not match any values in the index.
3. The error messages indicate that for some input types, like a list or a Series, the KeyError is not being raised as expected when an index match is not found. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue as well.
4. The current implementation lacks consistent handling of different indexers leading to the failing tests.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function inappropriately handles certain indexers, like lists and Series, leading to the KeyError not being raised when expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and raise a KeyError if the index match is not found.
2. Update the implementation to handle list-like indexers in a similar fashion to other types (ndarray, Index), ensuring consistency across all cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the handling of list-like indexers is updated to ensure that consistent behavior is maintained across all types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.
