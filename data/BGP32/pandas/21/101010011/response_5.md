### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library seems to be causing inconsistencies when indexing with list-like objects.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the behavior for indexing with different types like lists, numpy arrays, pandas Index, and Series objects is not consistent.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that when using `ser[list(key)]`, a `KeyError` is raised with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]".
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with list-like objects compared to other types like arrays, Index, and Series objects. It questions the reason behind this behavior discrepancy and suggests making all cases behave consistently.

### Potential Bug Location:
The bug seems to be related to how indexing with list-like objects is handled within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class.

### Bug Explanation:
The issue arises because the code first tries to convert the key to a list object (`key = list(key)`) and then attempts to infer the data type of the key. This conversion causes issues when dealing with Index objects, as they are already iterable. This inconsistency results in the `KeyError` when trying to index with a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is important to handle different types of keys consistently. Specifically, for list-like objects, we should avoid converting them to a list unnecessarily.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_index_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a condition to check if `key` is a list-like object that is not an `Index` type (using `is_index_like` helper function).
- This condition ensures that list-like objects are not redundantly converted to lists, addressing the inconsistency observed in the failing test.

By making this change, the function should now handle indexing with list-like objects consistently and pass the failing test.
