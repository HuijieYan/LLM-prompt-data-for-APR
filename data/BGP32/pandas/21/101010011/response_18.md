## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of key parameters such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and more for indexing a Series object.
2. The error messages from the failing test cases indicate that there is an inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers versus other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected KeyErrors and different outcomes.
4. The current implementation of the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, which results in the failing test cases.
5. The bug arises due to how list indexers are treated differently compared to other array-like indexers without a compelling reason.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, it is not being processed correctly, leading to unexpected KeyErrors and failing test cases.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers. This involves ensuring that the correct type of indexer is used based on the input key to avoid KeyErrors and unexpected behavior.

## Updated Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this updated version, the `_get_with` function now checks if the key is list-like and then converts it to a list for consistent handling of all array-like indexers. This change ensures that list indexers are processed correctly without causing KeyErrors or unexpected behavior.
