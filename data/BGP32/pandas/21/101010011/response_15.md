### 1. Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_with()` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate values. The function currently has issues with handling list-like indexers, which causes the failing test cases. It specifically raises a `KeyError` when a list indexer is used, which is not consistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

### 2. Potential Error Locations

The potential error locations within the function are related to how it handles list-like indexers. The current implementation does not correctly handle list indexers, leading to the `KeyError` being raised.

### 3. Explanation of the Bug

The bug arises due to inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated in the `_get_with()` function. The function is supposed to handle various types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects. When it encounters a list-like object as the key, it tries to treat it as an index and reindex the Series based on the key. However, the current implementation does not address list indexers properly, causing a `KeyError` to be raised incorrectly.

The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency, where list indexers do not behave the same way as other array-like indexers. The proposed fix aims to make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

### 4. Fixing Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with()` function to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. By adjusting the logic for list indexers to return the appropriate values without raising a `KeyError`, we can align the behavior with the expectations set by the failing test cases.

### 5. Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Updated the logic for list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when a list-like object is encountered as the key, it is treated the same way as numpy arrays or ExtensionArrays, returning the values without raising a `KeyError`. This change aligns the behavior with the expectations defined by the failing test cases and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
