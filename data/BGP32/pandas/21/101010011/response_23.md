### Analyzing the Buggy Function

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for whether the key is a list-like object may not be handling all cases correctly.
2. Handling of key type may not be consistent based on the error messages reported in the failing tests.
3. The return values based on the key type evaluations may not align with the expected behavior for the test cases.

#### Bug Explanation:
The failing tests indicate that there is inconsistency in the behavior when using list, array-like indexers (e.g., np.array, pd.Index), and pd.Series as keys in indexing a Series object. The error messages point out that the incorrect results are being returned in these cases, not raising a KeyError as expected.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the key is processed correctly for different types like list, np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.
2. Align the return values appropriately based on the type of key being used for indexing.
3. Update the conditions to handle different key types consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Updated to handle all cases consistently
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is Index-like for consistent processing
    
    if key.inferred_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle Index, Series, ExtensionArray, and np.ndarray keys
    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series, ExtensionArray, np.ndarray)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                pass
        else:
            try:
                return self.loc[ensure_index(key)]
            except KeyError:
                pass
    
    # Reindex keys other than integer, Index, Series, ExtensionArray, and np.ndarray
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes as outlined above, the corrected function should now handle the indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) consistently and return appropriate results without causing KeyErrors as reported in the failing tests.
