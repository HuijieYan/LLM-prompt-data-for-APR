### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is failing when trying to handle list-like indexing. The function should support different types of keys for indexing, including lists, arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
- The failing test is due to a discrepancy in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in different scenarios, resulting in inconsistent behavior and unexpected errors.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, pointing out conflicts in behavior and expectations.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when trying to handle list-like keys.
- When a Series key is converted to a list with `list(key)`, it doesn't handle the edge cases properly.
- The failure in the test is due to the inconsistency in behavior with list indexers compared to array-like indexers.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
- Maintain consistency in handling different types of indexers by refining the logic for list indexers.
- Update the logic for list-like keys to ensure proper handling and prevent errors.
- Align the behavior of list indexers with that of other indexers like arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
  
### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = list(key)

            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to appropriately handle list-like keys and ensuring consistency in indexing behavior across different types of keys, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the identified issue.
