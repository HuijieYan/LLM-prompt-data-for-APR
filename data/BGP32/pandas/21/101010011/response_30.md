### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing a `Series`.
2. The failing test is related to the behavior of the function when a list-like indexer is passed.
3. The error message suggests that when using a `list` indexer, an `IndexError` occurs indicating that the elements are not in the index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and questions the rationale behind it.
5. The current implementation of `_get_with` does not handle list-like indexers correctly and leads to the error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a `list` indexer is used, the function tries to access the elements using `self.loc[key]`, assuming it is a label-based index, leading to the `KeyError` because the elements are not found in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers correctly and distinguishes between label-based and positional indexers. Instead of directly using `self.loc[key]`, we should check the type of the indexer and use `self.loc` or `self.iloc` accordingly.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    # determine the type of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
            key = key.to_list()
            
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we handle the list-like indexers correctly, convert the indexer to a list if it is an `Index` or `Series`, and decide whether to use `loc` or `iloc` based on the inferred key type. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
