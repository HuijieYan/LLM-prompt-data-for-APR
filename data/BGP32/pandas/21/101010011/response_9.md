### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of indices like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc., and redirecting the appropriate operation to `loc` or `iloc` based on the type of input.
2. The failing test indicates that when using a list as an indexer, the behavior differs from using np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series indices.
3. The GitHub issue mentions the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers.
4. The error occurs when using a list index, and the expected KeyError is not raised, leading to inconsistency in behavior across different index types.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a list is used as an indexer, the function behaves consistently with other array-like objects.

### Bug Cause:
When the `_get_with` function in the Series class encounters a list indexer, it does not handle it properly, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series indices. This inconsistency results in the KeyError not being raised as expected in the failing test case, which violates the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list indexer is provided as input, the function behaves consistently with other array-like objects by handling the list accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like types, the corrected version ensures that the expected KeyError is raised when a list indexer does not match any elements in the Series index.
