### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is failing to handle the case when a list-like key is passed. The error message indicates a KeyError is being raised when accessing the element with a list-like key.
2. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, Series) when used to access elements in a Series.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case of a list-like key, leading to a KeyError. This inconsistency in behavior based on the type of indexer is not desirable.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` handles list-like keys in a consistent manner, similar to how other indexer types are handled.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, ensuring that it behaves similarly regardless of the type of indexer.
2. Ensure that list-like keys are processed correctly to prevent any KeyError from being raised.
3. Use `iloc` or `loc` based on the situation and ensure that the correct indexer is applied.
4. Update the function to follow the desired behavior as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Handle list-like keys consistently
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # Determine whether to use iloc or loc based on the situation
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle the duplicate indexing case
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected version above, the function should now handle list-like keys consistently and without raising any KeyError, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub discussion.
