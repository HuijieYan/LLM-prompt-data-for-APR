### Analyzing the Buggy Function

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error arises when trying to index a Series using a list-like key, like a list, numpy array, Index, or another Series.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates a `KeyError`, suggesting that the key used for indexing is not found in the Series' index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between indexing with list-like objects and other object types.
5. When indexing with a list, an exception is raised due to improper handling.

### Cause of the Bug

1. In the `_get_with` function, if the key is not recognized as a valid type or is a list-like object, `self.loc[key]` is called.
2. The bug occurs when the key is a list or other types (Index, Series) because the `.loc` indexer expects a value that exists in the index, which might not be the case when using a list as the key.
3. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised as the key values are not found in the Series' index.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we can adjust the behavior for handling list-like objects as keys by implementing logic that allows list-like objects to be treated in a more consistent manner while indexing. We should check if the key is a list or an array-like object in a separate conditional block before falling back to `self.loc[key]`.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # Adding a condition to handle list-like objects in a more consistent manner
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition `if is_list_like(key): return self.iloc[key]`, we can ensure that list-like objects are now handled appropriately, which should resolve the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests. This fix aligns the behavior for different types of key indexing, making it more consistent.
