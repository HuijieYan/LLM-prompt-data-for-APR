### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, lists, arrays, Series, and Index objects. The bug arises when using `list` as an indexer for the `Series`, causing an issue when retrieving values that do not exist in the index.

The failing test cases from `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` try to index a `Series` object with a key that does not exist in the index. The tests involve using different types of indexers like `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, with the expectation of raising a `KeyError` when the key does not match any index values.

### Identification of Potential Bug Location

The bug likely occurs when `list` is used as an indexer in the `_get_with` function. This may lead to incorrect handling of missing index values, not resulting in a `KeyError` as expected by the test cases.

### Explanation of the Bug Cause

The bug causes inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers, specifically when using a `list` as the indexer. The `_get_with` function should raise a `KeyError` when trying to access values that do not exist in the index, regardless of the type of indexer used.

### Bug Fixing Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when using a `list` indexer, the `_get_with` function correctly raises a `KeyError` for values that are not present in the underlying index. This fix should align the behavior with the expectations set by the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Bug Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("None of {} are in the index".format(repr(key)))

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.is_boolean():
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key.is_integer():
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, if the key is not list-like, it will raise a `KeyError` indicating that the provided key is not present in the index. This change ensures consistent behavior when accessing values that do not exist in the index, fixing the bug reported in the failing test cases.
