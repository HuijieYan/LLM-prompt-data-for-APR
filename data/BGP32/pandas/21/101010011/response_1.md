### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers in a `Series` object.
2. The failing test is indicating that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with indexers of other types (e.g., array-like, Series, Index).
3. The error message specifically mentions a `KeyError` being raised when trying to index with a list, while other types do not raise this error.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers in a `Series` object.

### Bugs:
1. The bug is related to the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class.
2. The function raises a `KeyError` when trying to index with a list, leading to the failing test.

### Cause of Bug:
1. The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function treating list indexers differently from other types, even though the desired behavior is consistency across all types of indexers.
2. The GitHub issue highlights that the behavior for list indexers is inconsistent with other types, leading to confusion and errors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function aligns with the behavior for other types of indexers.
2. Update the `_get_with` function to provide consistency in indexing behavior for all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "boolean":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the bug.
