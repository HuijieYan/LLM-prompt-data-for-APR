### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of pandas is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, Series, and Index.
2. The failing test cases are related to indexing with a list, numpy array, Index, and Series. The issue arises when a list key is passed, causing a KeyError to be raised due to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling indexers of different types for a `Series`, where list indexers behave differently from array-like indexers such as numpy arrays, Index, and Series.
4. The key issue causing the bug is the handling of list-like indexers that leads to a KeyError. The behavior for list indexers should be consistent with array-like indexers to avoid raising errors unexpectedly.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers aligns with the behavior of other array-like indexers.

### Proposed Fix:
To address the bug and provide a corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, list) else key

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional statements and handling list-like keys along with other array-like indexers, the fixed function ensures consistency in indexing behavior across different types of indexers. This correction should resolve the KeyError issues observed in the failing tests.
