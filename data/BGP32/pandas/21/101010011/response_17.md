### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a pandas Series object.
2. The test case is expecting an error message related to missing values in the index but the `ser[key]` operation is not raising the expected `KeyError`.
3. The error arises from an inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types like array-like indexers or Index objects.
4. The issue on GitHub points out this inconsistency and requests for a consistent behavior among different types of indexers.
5. The bug is likely due to the handling of different types of indexers leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior among various types of indexers.
- Ensure that when a list indexer is provided, it raises a KeyError when the elements in the list are not present in the index, similar to how other indexers behave.

### Correction:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ("float", "integer", "datetime", "category", "object", "timedelta"):
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Handle the case of list indexers consistently as other types
    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By modifying the logic to raise a `KeyError` when elements in the list indexer are not present in the index, we make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers as requested in the GitHub issue.
