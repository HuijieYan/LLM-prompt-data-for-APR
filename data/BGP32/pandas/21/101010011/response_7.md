### Analyze the buggy function
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a series. It checks the type of the key and applies the corresponding logic. The buggy behavior occurs when the key is a list-like object. The function fails to handle list-like keys properly, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

### Identify potential error locations
The issue is likely related to how the function is handling list-like objects as keys, especially when using the different indexers.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not correctly manage list-like keys, leading to inconsistencies when trying to index a Series with a key of type list.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
One approach to fix the bug is to ensure that list-like keys are appropriately handled, similar to how other indexers are handled. This can involve modifying the logic to address list-like keys more effectively.

### Corrected version of the function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Modify the logic to handle list-like keys better
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the logic to handle list-like keys more appropriately, based on how other indexers are detected and processed, the corrected version should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
