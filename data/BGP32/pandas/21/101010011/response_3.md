### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs and then perform corresponding operations.
2. The failing test is related to indexing a Series with a list-like key, where the test expects a `KeyError` to be raised but it does not happen.
3. The error occurs because the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block falls through to `self.loc[key]` instead of raising a `KeyError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of a non-list-like key where the key is not found in the index and ensure that a `KeyError` is raised in such scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the condition for handling non-list-like keys to raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the index.
- Ensure that the usage of `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]` is handled correctly based on the type of key.
- Make sure to pass the failing tests where a `KeyError` is expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these modifications, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case and behave as expected when indexing with a list-like key.
