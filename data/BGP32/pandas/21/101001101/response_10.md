## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of different types of keys. When the `key` parameter is not recognized as an acceptable type, the function incorrectly tries to index the Series using the `loc` method, which leads to a TypeError. This issue arises because the function does not properly identify the type of the key being used.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the `key` and appropriately handles the indexing based on that type. We should check for the different types of keys that can be used and handle them accordingly. Specifically, we need to make sure that the function correctly handles keys that are lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys and prevent the TypeError that was occurring before.
