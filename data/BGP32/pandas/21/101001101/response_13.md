### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the conditional check for `key_type == "integer"`. In the buggy function, this check is prone to false positives due to the way key is being handled. The function fails to accurately identify whether the key is an integer, preventing it from choosing the appropriate method for indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
Since the function is having difficulties determining the correct type of the key, it's crucial to improve this detection mechanism. One possible strategy is to enhance the key type detection process by accurately identifying different key types before proceeding with indexing.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

            if isinstance(key, list):
                return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes improved checks for key types and uses `is_scalar` and `is_list_like` functions to enhance the identification process. This approach should help in accurately discerning the type of key and selecting the appropriate indexing method.
