### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the case when `key` is not recognized as a list-like object. In this case, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, assuming `key` is a label-based indexer. However, if `key` is not list-like, it should be treated as a scalar instead of attempting label-based indexing. This leads to an error when `key` is a scalar that isn't recognized properly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if `key` is a scalar that is not recognized as list-like. If that is the case, we should directly return `self[key]` instead of using label-based indexing with `self.loc[key]`. This change will ensure that scalars that are not recognized as list-like are handled correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        # handle scalar values
        return self[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By incorporating the scalar check using `is_scalar(key)` and adjusting the handling of scalars accordingly, the corrected function should now behave as expected and handle scalars that are not recognized as list-like objects correctly.
