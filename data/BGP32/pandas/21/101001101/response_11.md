## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises because the code does not properly handle the case when the key is a list of values. The code attempts to determine the type of the key to decide whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`). However, for a list of values in the key, the type is inferred as "integer", leading to an incorrect branch selection. Consequently, the code fails to return the correct result for input cases where the key is a list.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the code needs to specifically check for the case when the key is a list of values. Instead of inferring the type of the key, the code should directly check if the key is a list and handle it appropriately to ensure the correct indexing method (`loc`) is used.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly checking if the key is a list using `is_list_like(key)` and using `loc[key]` in that case, the corrected version of the function appropriately handles cases where the key is a list of values and ensures the correct indexing method is used.
