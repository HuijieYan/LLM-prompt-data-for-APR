The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the key type. In the provided cases, the key is of type string, ('C'), which should be recognized as a string and handled accordingly. However, the function wrongly infers the key type as 'integer', leading to the incorrect path of execution.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify the key type as a string and handle it appropriately in the function's logic. We can compare the key type to 'string' and ensure that string keys are treated as such. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly considering the key type as a string and handling it appropriately, the corrected function will now return the expected results for the provided cases.

This corrected version ensures that keys of type 'string' are correctly handled with the `self.loc[key]` path, and other key types are treated accordingly.
