## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs due to incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not a list-like, integer, or tuple.

In the buggy function:
1. If the `key` is not list-like, it tries to access the item at the `key` position using `self.loc[key]`.
2. It expects the `key` to be of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index` for further processing.

However, in the failing test cases:
1. The `key` is a scalar string (e.g., 'C'), causing the function to incorrectly treat it as non-list-like.
2. The actual type assigned to `key_type` (which influences the subsequent logic) is 'string', which is incorrect.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case where the `key` is a scalar string. We can modify the condition that checks for non-list-like keys to include the case when `key` is a scalar string. We will update the logic to treat scalar strings as valid keys as well.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for scalar string keys as well
    if not is_list_like(key) or (isinstance(key, str) and not isinstance(key, (Index, Series))):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including the condition for scalar strings and ensuring correct handling for various key types, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle the inputs and satisfy all the given test cases.
