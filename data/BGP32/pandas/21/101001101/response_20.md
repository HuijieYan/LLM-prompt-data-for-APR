The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of key types and the decision-making process based on key types. The issue lies in the condition where `key_type == "integer"`, which leads to incorrect branching between positional indexing and label-based indexing. To fix this bug, we need to accurately identify the key type and determine the correct indexing approach.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not is_list_like(key):
                return self.loc[key]
            elif not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is accurately determined and appropriate indexing methods are chosen based on the key's characteristics. This approach aligns with the expected behavior for different key types, maintaining consistency and correctness in the function's logic.
