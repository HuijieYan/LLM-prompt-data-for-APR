### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key_type variable, which is used to determine how to index the Series. In the buggy function, the key_type is wrongly assigned based on the content of the key, leading to incorrect indexing decisions.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type variable is correctly inferred based on the type of the key. This will ensure that the Series indexing is performed accurately. Additionally, we need to handle the different types of keys appropriately to prevent errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now accurately infers key_type based on the type of key provided. Additionally, it handles different types of keys appropriately to ensure correct indexing behavior.
