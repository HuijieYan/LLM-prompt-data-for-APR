### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with a key that is not recognized as a list-like object. In the provided code, there is an incorrect check for non-list-like keys where the key is directly passed to `self.loc` without considering the actual type of the key. This results in an incorrect logic path where the key is considered a label-based indexer even if it's not a list-like object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for non-list-like keys to distinguish between different types of keys. We should check if the key is a scalar that is not recognized by the `lib.is_scalar` function and then handle it appropriately. We also need to consider cases where the key is not a recognized list-like object.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles non-list-like keys by correctly checking if the key is a scalar that is not recognized as one of the list-like types, and then directs the logic based on that consideration.
