### Error Identification
1. The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle the case when `key` is a list-like object properly, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing tests.
2. The issue lies in the last `elif` condition where `key` is checked for being a list-like object but not properly processed.
3. The function should handle list-like objects correctly to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation
The `_get_with` function fails during the test because it does not correctly handle list-like objects, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to index with a list. This behavior is inconsistent with other indexers like ndarray or Index, which do not raise a `KeyError` in such cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Check if `key` is a list-like object and convert it to a list if necessary.
2. Return the corresponding elements based on whether `key` is an instance of Index or a list of indices.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already one
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the correct handling for list-like objects in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected behavior as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
