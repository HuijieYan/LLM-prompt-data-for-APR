## Analysis

1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of input `key` to retrieve values from the Series.
2. The bug arises when `key` is a list, and the function does not handle this case correctly, resulting in a KeyError.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior for different types of `key`, but the current implementation fails for the list type.
4. The issue raised on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers, causing unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when `key` is a list. Instead of treating it as valid index values, it results in a KeyError when attempting to locate the items in the Series.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling a list type `key`. We should ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types during the retrieval process.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    # Handle list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # Handle the case when key is a list
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly handling list-like keys and ensuring consistent treatment for all index-like types, the corrected version of the function should resolve the inconsistency and pass the failing test.
