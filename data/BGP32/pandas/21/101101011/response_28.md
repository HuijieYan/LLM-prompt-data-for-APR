### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. When the key is passed as a list-like object, the code attempts to determine the key's type to decide how to handle the indexing. However, the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, leading to wrong index handling decisions. This results in incorrect behavior and raises KeyError in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the key's type before deciding how to handle the indexing. Additionally, we should ensure that the key type is correctly identified for different types of keys to align with the expected behavior. We will address the issue of incorrect key type inference and update the code to handle the indexing based on the key type correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the key type inference and appropriately handling the indexing based on the key type, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
