### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs, but it fails to appropriately handle the case where `key` is converted to a list. This issue arises due to the inconsistent behavior when `key` is passed as a list, causing a KeyError.
2. The test function is designed to check the behavior when passing different types of `key` inputs to the `ser[key]` syntax, highlighting the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers.
3. During execution, the key_type variable incorrectly identifies the type as a string, leading to improper handling and eventually raising a KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers. When `key` is converted to a list and passed into the `_get_with` function, the function does not handle it properly, leading to a KeyError due to the mismatch in behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly handles the case where `key` is a list. Since the test cases reveal a Key error during the execution, the bug fix should focus on resolving the inconsistency in how list indexers are processed within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function, we aim to resolve the KeyError issue and align the behavior with other types of indexers, ensuring consistent and accurate indexing across different data types.
