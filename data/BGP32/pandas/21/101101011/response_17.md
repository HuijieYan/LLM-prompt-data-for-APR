### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is not handling the case when the key is a list properly. It treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior.

In the failing test, when the key is converted to a list in the `test_getitem_no_matches` test function, it raises a `KeyError` because the key is not found in the index, leading to a test failure.

The key issue is in the conditional branches handling different types of keys in the `_get_with` function, resulting in incorrect handling of list-like keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for list indexers aligns with other array-like indexers. This involves modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers properly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional logic to handle list-like keys in the same way as other array-like keys, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
