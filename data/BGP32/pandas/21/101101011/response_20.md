## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a `Series` in pandas. The current issue arises when a list-like key is passed to the function, causing an incorrect behavior due to the implementation handling the different key types inconsistently. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test where using a list-like key raises a `KeyError`.

The function fails to properly handle list, numpy array, Index, and Series as indexers consistently. The root cause of the bug lies in the conditional checks and handling of different `key` types within the function.

## Bug Cause
- The function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to the `KeyError` in the failing test.
- The conditional logic for checking key types is not consistent and leads to incorrect handling of certain cases.
- The incorrect behavior is due to the combination of type checks and subsequent actions based on those types, especially for list-like keys.

## Proposed Fix
1. Update the conditional checks to handle list-like keys uniformly.
2. Ensure proper handling of list, numpy array, Index, and Series as indexers.
3. Modify the return statements accordingly to handle different key types consistently.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if is_list_like(key):
            key = ensure_index(key)

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the conditional checks and return statements, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys uniformly and pass the failing test scenario.
