The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when handling list-like key input. It fails to correctly process the list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, causing a KeyError in some cases. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency in behavior and requests a unified handling approach for all indexer types.

To address this bug and align with the expected behavior, we need to adjust the code inside the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional check for `is_list_like(key)` to ensure that list indexers are correctly handled. We also adjusted the logic for converting the key to a list when necessary. This change should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.

By implementing these modifications, we can address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function and ensure that all types are processed correctly, aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
