### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the series. However, the issue arises when dealing with a list-like indexer.
2. The failing test is triggered when trying to access a value in the series using a list-like indexer, causing a `KeyError` to be raised because the key is not found in the index.
3. The key_type is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all cases, which indicates that the inference logic for the key type is not functioning as expected.
4. The current approach in `_get_with` doesn't handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to the issue highlighted in the GitHub problem statement.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like indexers and improve the key type inference mechanism.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Enhance the logic for identifying the key type to correctly differentiate between different types of indexers.
2. Update the handling of list-like indexers by checking if the key is present in the index before returning the values.
3. Ensure that the behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers is consistent and aligned with user expectations.
4. Include proper validation and error handling to prevent `KeyError` exceptions for list-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not in index")
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the above correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers correctly and avoid raising `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index. This fix aligns the behavior with user expectations and resolves the inconsistency observed in the failing test.
