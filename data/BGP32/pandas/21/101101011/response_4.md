### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The issue arises when the input `key` is a list-like object. In the case where `key` is converted to a list, the bug causes the method to fail to handle the index properly and results in a KeyError.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the condition where `key` is neither a slice nor a tuple, and the code tries to deal with non-list-like objects. The problematic section is when `key` is converted to a list and then checked for type, which leads to incorrect handling of the index.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to refactor the code that deals with the different types of keys. Specifically, when `key` is converted to a list, we need to ensure that the indexing based on that list is performed correctly and does not cause a KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` method in the `Series` class:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list-like objects in the `key`, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the index and avoid the KeyError issue that was causing the failing test.
