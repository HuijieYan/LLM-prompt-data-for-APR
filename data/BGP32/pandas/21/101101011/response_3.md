### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers. It fails to handle the case when the key is a list-like object correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like key inputs properly. When the key is a list, the function incorrectly tries to use it directly without converting it to a format suitable for indexing.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are properly converted to a suitable format for indexing before processing. This will ensure consistency in handling various types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Impact of the Fix:
The corrected version of the function should handle list-like keys correctly, ensuring that the function behaves consistently with different types of indexers. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub problem description.
