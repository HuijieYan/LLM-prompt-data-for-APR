## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs in a Series object and performing the appropriate indexing operation. 
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of key inputs, such as lists, arrays, Index objects, and Series objects, to access elements from a Series, leading to a KeyError because the indexing behavior is inconsistent across these input types.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers like lists, arrays, Index, and Series objects, showing that the behavior for list indexers is different and leads to a KeyError.
4. The bug occurs when the key is not list-like, and the conditional check in the buggy function does not handle this case correctly, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional checks in the `_get_with` function in the case where the key is not list-like. The current implementation does not appropriately handle this scenario, leading to unexpected behavior and a KeyError when indexing with non-list-like keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the handling of different types of key input is consistent and robust. Specifically, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle non-list-like keys and perform the indexing operation correctly without raising a KeyError.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle non-list-like keys and effectively perform the indexing operation, we ensure a consistent behavior when accessing elements from a Series with different types of indexers. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
