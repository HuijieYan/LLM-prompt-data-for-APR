### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where different types of indexers are handled inconsistently. When `key` is a list, the function tries to check if the key is recognized as an indexer. If the key is not list-like, it tries to retrieve the value using `self.loc[key]`. However, in some cases, this leads to a `KeyError` because the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers and avoid the `KeyError` when accessing values using `self.loc[key]`. We can modify the condition checking for list-like keys and handle it in a way that aligns with the behavior of other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version will handle list indexers consistently with other indexer types and prevent `KeyError` by efficiently retrieving values corresponding to the provided key.
