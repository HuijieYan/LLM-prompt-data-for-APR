### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling input key of type list. In the case where the key is a list, the function wrongly attempts to treat it as an Index, leading to an error when trying to access an element not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check for the case where the key is a list and handle it appropriately to avoid the KeyError. We should treat lists as positional indexers and ensure that accessing elements that do not exist in the index does not raise an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the list indexing case by using positional index
        return self._getitem_array(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when the key is a list, a new function `_getitem_array` is used to handle list indexing specifically, ensuring that index out of bounds errors are avoided. This approach aligns the handling of list indexers with array-like indexers, resolving the issue introduced by treating lists differently.
