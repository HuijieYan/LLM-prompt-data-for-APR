### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing issues when handling different types of indexers like lists, arrays, and indices. The bug arises from the inconsistent behavior in treating list indexers differently from array-like and index indexers. When a list is passed as an indexer, the function tries to handle it differently than other types, leading to a KeyError when the list indexer is not found in the index.

The issue is related to the GitHub problem "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches," where inconsistency in handling different types of indexers causes unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and align the behavior of the function for different types of indexers, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently. Specifically, we need to address the case when a list indexer is passed and prevent KeyError exceptions by treating it similarly to other indexer types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By implementing this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, we can now handle different types of indexers consistently, preventing the KeyError exceptions when dealing with list indexers. This fix aligns with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue and ensures that the function behaves uniformly for various types of indexers.
