The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers like list, array-like, and Index. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue where the behavior differs when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers or Index.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug originates from how the function handles different types of indexers. When a list indexer is passed, the function tries to interpret it as a key directly, leading to a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how array-like indexers or Index objects are handled, leading to the reported issue on GitHub.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers or Index objects to maintain consistency. This involves updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should resolve the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the logic in the `_get_with` function, it should now handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers or Index objects, resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
