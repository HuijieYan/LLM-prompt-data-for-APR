### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc., and then determine the appropriate action based on the key type.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior of indexing with different types of containers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) where the key doesn't match any values in the Series object.
3. The buggy function fails to appropriately handle the key when it is a list type, leading to a KeyError in the failing test.
4. The root cause of the bug is that for a list key, the function tries to access elements by index directly rather than handling it as an indexing operation.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like keys to align them with the behavior of other container types.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function logic for handling list-like keys to ensure it behaves consistently with other container types.
2. Check if the key matches any index values before trying to access elements directly by index to prevent KeyErrors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments to the logic, the corrected function should now properly handle list-like keys and avoid the KeyError issue seen in the failing test cases.
