### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional block that handles cases where the `key` parameter is not a slice, a DataFrame, or a tuple. The bug occurs because the function checks if the `key` is a scalar value and tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`. This approach fails to handle the case when `key` is a list, NumPy array, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray, causing the KeyError to be raised.

The root cause of the bug can be traced back to the `not is_list_like(key)` condition, where the intention is to handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. However, this implementation is missing checks for other valid key types. This oversight leads to incorrect handling of list-like objects, resulting in the raised KeyError during indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional block that handles non-slice, non-DataFrame, non-tuple `key` inputs. We should check if the `key` parameter is a list, NumPy array, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray, and appropriately split the logic for handling these cases. By ensuring that all valid key types are considered in the conditional checks, we can prevent the KeyError from being raised incorrectly.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating proper checks for list-like objects and other valid key types, the corrected version of the function should now handle various input key types without raising the KeyError as observed in the failing tests.
