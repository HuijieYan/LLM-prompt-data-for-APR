### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is failing to handle the indexing correctly when passed a key that is not found in the Series index. The function is intended to process different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, numpy arrays, and Series. However, there is an issue when dealing with keys that are not present in the Series index, leading to the KeyError.

1. The function checks if the key is an instance of a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or if it is not list-like.
2. If the key is not list-like, it tries to retrieve the value using the `self.loc[key]` method.
3. Then it checks if the key is an instance of specific types to determine how to index (positional or label-based) based on the index.
4. In the failing test, the key is an object array not present in the Series index, causing the error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the key is not present in the Series index correctly. When the key is not found, the function should raise a KeyError to indicate that the key does not exist in the index. However, the function logic does not appropriately account for this situation, leading to the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should update the function `_get_with` to properly handle the scenario when the key is not present in the Series index. If the key is not found, the function should raise a KeyError. We can achieve this by checking if the key exists in the Series index before attempting to retrieve the value. If the key is not in the index, raise a KeyError.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is in the Series index
    if not any(self.index == k for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By incorporating the additional check to verify if the key is in the Series index and raising a KeyError if it is not found, the corrected implementation should now handle cases where the key does not exist in the index correctly and pass the failing test cases.
