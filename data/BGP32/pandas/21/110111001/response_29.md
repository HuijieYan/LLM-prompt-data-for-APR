## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing in a pandas Series. However, the bug arises from a logical flaw in handling the key type `'string'`. 

The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`, which leads to issues in selecting the data based on the key. This incorrect inference causes a KeyError to be raised when trying to access an element that seemingly should exist in the index. 

This bug is evident in the failing tests as they expect the element `'C'` to be present in the Series index, but the bug prevents this from happening, resulting in a KeyError not being raised as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic for inferring the key type in the `_get_with` function. By properly identifying the key type and handling string keys correctly, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected and returns the correct output without raising KeyErrors when accessing valid index elements.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a dedicated check for key_type == "string", we can handle string keys appropriately in the `_get_with` function, allowing the function to correctly access elements from the Series without raising KeyErrors.
