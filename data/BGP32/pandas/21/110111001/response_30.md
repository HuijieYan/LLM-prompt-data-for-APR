The buggy function `_get_with` is failing because it incorrectly handles the case when the `key` parameter is passed as an array-like object (list, ndarray, Index, or Series). The function is mistakenly treating the `key` parameter as a scalar value and attempting to index the Series with it directly, causing a KeyError to be raised.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the way the function handles different types of `key` inputs. We should check if `key` is an array-like object and then proceed accordingly by returning the corresponding values from the Series or reindexing if necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking for array-like types first and handling them appropriately, we ensure that the Series is indexed correctly, resolving the KeyError raised in the failing tests.
