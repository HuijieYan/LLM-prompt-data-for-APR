### Bug Explanation:
The bug is happening because the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list-like object like an array, Index, or Series correctly. The bug is triggered in the failing test when trying to index the Series object with a key that is not present in the index, resulting in a `KeyError` that is not being properly raised.

The issue arises from how the function handles different types of keys. When the key is not recognized as a scalar, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` and proceeds to perform inappropriate indexing based on this assumption.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we correctly identify the type of the key that is being used for indexing and handle different types appropriately. Specifically, when the key is a list-like object, we should handle it as such and not assume it is a scalar value.

### Corrected Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle list-like keys when indexing a Series object. This fix ensures that the `KeyError` is properly raised when attempting to index a Series with a key that is not present in the index.
