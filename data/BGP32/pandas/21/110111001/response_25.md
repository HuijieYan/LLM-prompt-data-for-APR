The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is failing because it incorrectly handles the case where the key is not list-like.

Based on the failing test and the provided runtime values and types, it seems that the function is not handling the key type `'string'` properly when it is not list-like. Instead of checking if the key is list-like, the function erroneously tries to interpret it as a label-based indexer, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to correctly differentiate between the different key types and appropriately handle the case where the key is not list-like.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check for scalar keys and uses the `is_scalar` function to properly handle non-list-like keys by accessing them using `self.loc[key]`.

By incorporating this change, the corrected function should now properly handle the failing scenarios outlined in the failing test cases.
