### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when trying to handle different types of keys for indexing. The issue arises when the key type is a list or ndarray of strings, and the function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'` instead of `'object'`. This incorrect inference leads to the wrong indexing method being selected, resulting in a `KeyError` during the test.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 4, the input key is a list, ndarray, or Series containing string values, which should be inferred as type `'object'`.
2. Despite having string values, the function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`, leading to the wrong selection of the indexing method.
3. As a result, the function tries to index the Series using a string type key, which causes a `KeyError` during the test since the string key doesn't exist in the index.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the key type is a list, ndarray, or Series containing string values, it should be correctly inferred as type `'object'`. This will ensure that the appropriate indexing method is selected based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "object":
        return self.loc[key] if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() else self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the key type inference in the function, it will now correctly handle list, ndarray, and Series containing string values, leading to the correct selection of the indexing method and resolving the `KeyError` during the test.
