The buggy function `_get_with` is failing the test due to incorrect handling of the input key. The function is intended to process different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects. However, the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key in some cases and is not returning the proper result.

The issue lies in the logic where it determines the `key_type` based on the input key. It then tries to handle different cases based on the `key_type` value, which leads to incorrect behavior and the test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to correctly identify the key type and handle each case appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, abc.Iterable) and not isinstance(key, str):
        key = list(key)
        
        if all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this fixed version, we first check if the key is a slice and handle it accordingly. Then, we check if the key is an iterable but not a string. If all elements in the iterable are strings, we use `loc` to access the values, otherwise, we use `iloc` for positional indexing. If the key does not fall into these cases, we default to reindexing.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the function handle the different types of keys correctly according to the expected behavior.
