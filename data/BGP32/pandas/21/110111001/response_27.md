The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the key parameter when it is a list-like object, causing a KeyError to be raised incorrectly. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, leading to the wrong branch of the conditional statements being executed.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the key_type inference based on the type of the key parameter correctly. We should infer the type based on the type of the key object, not on the elements inside it. By fixing the key_type inference, we can ensure that the correct branch of the conditional statements is taken.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly handle list-like objects as keys and avoid raising unnecessary KeyErrors. The failing test cases should pass without any errors.
