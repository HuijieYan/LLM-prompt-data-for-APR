The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly handles the case when the `key` parameter is not recognized as list-like data. In such cases, it attempts to access the value using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

To fix this issue, we should modify the function to handle non-list-like keys correctly by checking if the key is present in the index before attempting to access the value. If the key is not found in the index, we should raise a `KeyError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

This fixed version of the function first checks if the `key` is in the index before trying to access the value. If the `key` is not found in the index, it raises a `KeyError` with a descriptive message.

By implementing this change, the function should now correctly handle non-list-like keys and avoid the `KeyError` that was occurring in the failing tests.
