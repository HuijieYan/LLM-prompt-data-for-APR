The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` variable when it is not recognized as a list-like object. The function currently attempts to use `self.loc[key]` to return values from the Series, leading to a KeyError in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle non-list-like keys properly. We can modify the function to raise a KeyError when the key is not in the index, which is the expected behavior based on the failing tests and error messages.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that when `key` is not in the Series index, it raises a KeyError, matching the behavior expected by the failing test cases. After making this update, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing tests without raising a KeyError.
