### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when trying to handle different types of `key` inputs. The bug arises from incorrect handling of various key types and not falling back to positional indexing correctly in certain cases.

1. In Case 1, the input `key` is a list, and the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` instead of `'object'`.
2. In Case 2, the input `key` is an ndarray, and the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` instead of `'object'`.
3. In Case 3, the input `key` is an Index object, and the key_type is correctly inferred as `'string'`.
4. In Case 4, the input `key` is a Series, and the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string' instead of 'object'`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type inference is done correctly for all types of keys provided. Additionally, the logic for falling back to positional indexing needs to be revised to handle different cases appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle other key types
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle various types of keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
