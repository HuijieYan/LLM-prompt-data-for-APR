The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of `key` input. The function currently fails because it expects that the `key` input should always be an array-like object, leading to issues when a `key` input of type `Index` or `Series` is passed.

The buggy function has an `if` condition to check if the `key` input is an instance of `Index`, but later it converts the `key` input to a list unconditionally, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the `key` input correctly based on its type. If the `key` input is an instance of `Index` or `Series`, we should directly use it without converting it to a list.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle key types
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle list-like keys that are not Index or Series
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of different types of `key` inputs, ensuring that the function can handle `Index` and `Series` inputs correctly without converting them to lists unnecessarily. This fix should address the failing tests.
