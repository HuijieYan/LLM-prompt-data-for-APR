The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by incorrectly handling the input key, leading to an incorrect determination of the `key_type` and subsequently the wrong branches being executed. The function is not correctly identifying the type of key in some cases, resulting in the wrong return paths being taken.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified, especially when dealing with different types of input like lists, arrays, Series, or Index objects. We should also consider handling cases where the key is of type `Index` separately to properly infer the key type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the issue with identifying the key type correctly based on the input, leading to the appropriate actions within the function for different types of keys, fixing the failing tests.
