The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of a key that is not recognized as list-like. The code tries to use the `loc` method on the Series, assuming that the key is a scalar, but in certain cases this leads to a KeyError.

The following is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self._get_value(key)

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Changes made:
1. Added a check using `is_scalar(key)` to identify scalar values
2. Changed the handling of scalar keys to call the `_get_value` method instead of `self.loc[key]`
3. Added a separate condition for list-like keys to use `self.loc[key]`
4. Removed unnecessary check for `key` type as a list, as it is already checked in the above conditions

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test provided.
