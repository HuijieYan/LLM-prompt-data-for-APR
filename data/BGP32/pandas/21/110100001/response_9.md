### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used to retrieve data from the Series by passing a key. 
2. The bug arises when the key is a list or ndarray and none of the values in the key are present in the Series index, leading to a KeyError.
3. The bug is affecting the behavior of indexing the Series with various data types like list, ndarray, Index, Series, etc.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where none of the values in the key are present in the index, and it should raise a KeyError with an appropriate error message.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function because when the key is a list and none of the values in the list exist in the Series index, the function does not handle this case correctly. It tries to reindex based on the key, which results in a KeyError since the values are not found in the index.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if all the values in the key exist in the Series index before proceeding with reindexing. If none of the values are present, we should raise a KeyError with a suitable error message.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):  # check if the key is not a list-like object
        return self.loc[key]

    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):  # check if any key value is not in the index
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By updating the `_get_with` function with this corrected version, the bug should be fixed, and the provided failing test should pass successfully.
