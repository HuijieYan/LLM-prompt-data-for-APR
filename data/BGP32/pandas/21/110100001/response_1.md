After analyzing the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue lies in the handling of the `key` variable when it's a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. The function tries to handle the case where `key` is one of these types as if it was always a list, causing a misinterpretation of the key and leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly handle the various types of `key`. Specifically, for cases where `key` is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of `key` and behaves accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list, numpy array, Index, or Series
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]  # treat as label-based
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]  # treat as positional indexer
    
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # If key is not one of the recognized types, reindex
    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version of the function now correctly identifies the type of `key` and acts accordingly, resolving the bug that caused the KeyError.
