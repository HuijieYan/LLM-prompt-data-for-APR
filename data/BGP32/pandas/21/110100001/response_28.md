### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
- The bug seems to be related to the conversion of the key to a list when handling non-list-like keys.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series index, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised.
- The bug causes the wrong behavior when trying to handle non-list-like keys, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys in the `_get_with` function.
- When encountering a non-list-like key, the function erroneously tries to convert the key to a list without considering the actual type of the key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of keys, especially when the key is not list-like.
- Instead of blindly converting the key to a list, we should first check the type of the key and handle it accordingly to maintain the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle non-list-like keys appropriately
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug related to indexing with non-list-like keys should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing test.
