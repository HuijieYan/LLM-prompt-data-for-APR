There are a couple of parts in the `_get_with` function that need fixing. 

1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` attempts to handle scalars in a conditional branch, but it attempts to access `self.loc[key]`, which could result in a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index.
2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)): key = list(key)` is attempting to convert `key` to a list if it is not already a list, but this could potentially lose information about data structure when coercing to a list.

To fix these issues and make the function match the expectations of the failing test, we need to handle the case of a scalar key more effectively and ensure that the key is not coerced into a list if it's not a list, array, or index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            key = key.values
        else:
            key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function handles scalar keys more appropriately and doesn't coerce keys into a list unless necessary. This should help the function pass the failing test where the previous version resulted in a `KeyError`.
