### Analysis:
1. The `buggy function` `_get_with` is called when a key is used to index a `Series` object. It checks the type of the key to determine the appropriate action to take during indexing.
2. The potential errors could be related to how the function handles different types of keys and whether it correctly looks up the values from the series.
3. The bug is likely causing incorrect indexing behavior when a key of type `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` is passed to the `Series` object. This is evident from the failing test that checks for KeyError when attempting to retrieve a value that does not exist in the index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different key types and index lookups. Specifically, it should handle cases where the key is of type `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` appropriately.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

#### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):  # Slice handling
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):  # DataFrame error handling
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):  # Tuple handling
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):  # Scalar handling
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):  # Handle list, ndarray, Series appropriately
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # If none of the above, try reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle lists, ndarrays, and Series correctly, the corrected version should pass the failing test and have improved behavior when indexing the `Series` object.
