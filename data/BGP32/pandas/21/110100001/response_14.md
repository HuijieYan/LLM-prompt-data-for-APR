## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a series.
2. The bug is most likely related to the handling of the key types and how the indexing operation is performed.

## Identified Bug:
The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of key types when they are neither list-like nor recognized as a specific data type, leading to an error during the indexing operation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to ensure that the key types are properly handled and that the appropriate indexing method (`.loc` or `.iloc`) is used based on the key type.

## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure to handle all possible key types correctly, especially the case of non-list-like keys, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
