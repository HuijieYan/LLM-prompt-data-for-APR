## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in pandas, responsible for indexing and retrieving values from a Series object. The bug seems to be related to how different types of keys are handled within the function, leading to incorrect behavior when a key of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` is passed.

## Bug
The bug occurs when the key is checked to determine its type. In the buggy function, the conditional checks do not handle all possible key types correctly, leading to an incorrect path being taken when certain keys are encountered. This leads to a wrong index being used for retrieval, ultimately causing a `KeyError` when trying to access the values.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks within the `_get_with` function to correctly handle all possible key types. By ensuring that each key type is appropriately processed and the corresponding values are retrieved using the correct indexing method (`loc`, `iloc`, or `reindex`), we can address the issue and make the function work as intended.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the conditional checks and ensuring that each key type is processed appropriately for indexing, the function should now handle all types of keys correctly and avoid the `KeyError` issue.
