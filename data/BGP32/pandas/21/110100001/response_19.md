The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the type checking logic. The bug arises when `key` is not recognized as a list-like object and falls into the `not is_list_like(key)` condition. In this case, it tries to access `self.loc[key]`, assuming `key` is a valid label for indexing. 

However, if `key` is not a recognized scalar type, it results in a `KeyError` because it could not find the label in the index.

The bug can be fixed by adding a check to handle non-scalars that are not recognized. We can convert such non-scalars to a list and then proceed with the indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-scalar to list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a check for non-scalars that are not recognized, converting them to a list before proceeding with the indexing. This change should address the `KeyError` issue that occurred due to unrecognized scalar types.
