### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class has a method `_get_with(self, key)` defined to handle different types of keys for indexing.
2. The method `_get_with(self, key)` tries to handle various scenarios like slices, DataFrame, tuples, and other key types.
3. The bug seems to be in the handling of key types when it is not list-like. The code attempts to use `self.loc[key]` in such cases.
4. The failing test case expects a `KeyError` when trying to access an element not present in the series index.
5. The bug occurs when the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series with elements not present in the series index.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy code is trying to access the element using `self.loc[key]` when the key is not list-like and contains elements not present in the series index. This results in a `KeyError` as expected by the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Instead of accessing the element directly using `self.loc[key]`, a check should be added to verify if each element of the key is present in the series index. If any element is not present, raise a `KeyError` similar to the failing test case.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Check if each element of the key is present in the index
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"Some elements in '{key}' are not in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After making the above corrections to the `_get_with` method, it should handle cases where the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series with elements not present in the series index and raise a `KeyError` when needed.
