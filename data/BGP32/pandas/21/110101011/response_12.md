### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The issue arises when dealing with list indexers, as the function currently does not handle them correctly.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to access an element that does not exist in the series index using different types of indexers.
4. The runtime values show that the function incorrectly determines the `key_type` as `'string'`, which is causing the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of list indexers within the `_get_with` function. The function fails to properly differentiate between different types of indexers and ends up inferring the key type incorrectly as a string, leading to incorrect behavior when accessing elements.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly within the `_get_with` function. We should differentiate the types of indexers and handle them appropriately based on their characteristics to avoid inferring the key type incorrectly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- List indexers are treated properly based on their characteristics.
- Key type is inferred correctly to avoid KeyError when accessing elements that do not exist in the series index.
