## Analysis
The `buggy function` `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is not handling the case where the key is a list properly. The issue is related to how the function treats different types of indexers. The failing test expects consistent behavior across different types of indexers such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The current implementation treats list indexers differently as compared to other types like ndarray or Index.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a key that is a list, leading to an incorrect handling of the key's type, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats list indexers consistently with other types of indexers like ndarray and Index. The function needs to correctly handle the case where the key is a list to avoid the `KeyError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function addresses the inconsistency in handling list indexers and should pass the failing test while aligning the behavior with other types of indexers in the codebase.
