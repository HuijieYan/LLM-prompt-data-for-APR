### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing, but it fails in certain cases, as indicated by the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.
2. Based on the provided runtime input/output values, the issue seems to be related to how key types are handled, specifically when the key is not found in the index.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly return a KeyError when trying to index with a list key, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers like ndarray or Index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that indexing with list keys behaves consistently with other indexers and handles the KeyError situation properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_with` function to handle list keys in a consistent manner with other index types.
2. When a list key is provided, check if any elements in the key are not present in the index and raise a KeyError similar to how ndarray or Index keys are handled.
3. Ensure that the returned error message matches the one expected in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        intersection = self.index.intersection(key)
        missing_values = [val for val in key if val not in intersection]
        if missing_values:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_values} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list keys as an intersection with the index and checking for missing values, this corrected version should ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different key types in the `Series` class.
