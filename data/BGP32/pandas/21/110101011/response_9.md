### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers to retrieve values.
2. The function checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or not list-like. If the key is not list-like, it tries to locate the key using `self.loc[key]`.
3. The bug occurs when the key is an Index object or any other object not covered by the previous conditions. In this case, it tries to infer the type of the key, and if the key is of type 'integer', it decides whether to use positional indexing (`self.iloc`) or label-based indexing (`self.loc`). However, the inferred type might not always be accurate.
4. The failing test is trying to index the Series with a key that has no matches in the index, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, even when it should be `'object'`. This issue leads to the wrong path of execution, ultimately leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type inference is correct for all types of keys. Specifically, for cases where the key is an Index object or any other object, the key type should be inferred as `'object'`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = 'object'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly setting `key_type = 'object'` when the key is an Index object and fixing the key type inference for other cases, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle different types of indexers and resolve the `KeyError` issue.
