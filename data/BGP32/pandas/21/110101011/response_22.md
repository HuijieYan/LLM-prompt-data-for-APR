### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters a key of type list that contains a scalar value that is not recognized correctly and leads to an incorrect flow in the function.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the behavior for various indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to be consistent, but the function fails to handle list indexers properly, resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. The bug seems to stem from incorrectly handling the key as a list, which causes unexpected behavior during indexing.
5. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function correctly handles list indexers containing scalar values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the input type of the key and ensure that it is correctly identified as a list.
2. If the key is a list, extract the values from the list and process them accordingly to avoid unexpected errors.
3. Handle the case of scalar values inside the list in a way that aligns with the expected behavior for the entire list.
4. Update the function to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)
        # check for scalar values in the list and handle them appropriately
        if any(is_scalar(k) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version now includes checks to handle scalar values inside the list properly and ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers in the `Series` class.
