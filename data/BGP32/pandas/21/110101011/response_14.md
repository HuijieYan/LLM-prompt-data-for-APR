### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class contains conditional checks for different types of input `key`, including slices, dataframes, tuples, and scalars.
2. The issue arises when `key` is a list-like object, and the function attempts to handle it using multiple conditions. This leads to incorrect behavior and results in a KeyError.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a KeyError with a specific message, which indicates that the current implementation of `_get_with` is not handling list-like input correctly.
4. The runtime values show that in each case, the `key_type` is detected as a string, which is incorrect and leads to the incorrect handling of list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect inference of the `key_type` as a string in all cases, which leads to the function trying to handle the input key as a string instead of a list-like object. This results in the KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly detect the type of the `key` parameter, especially when it is a list-like object.
2. Ensure that the function handles list-like keys appropriately to prevent the KeyError.
3. Adjust the conditions for handling different types of `key` to align with the expected behavior in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing tests should pass as expected.
