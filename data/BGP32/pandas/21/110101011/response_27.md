## Analysis
1. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of indexers to retrieve values from the series.
2. The function checks the type of the key to determine how to process it, but there are inconsistencies in how different types of keys are handled.
3. The failing test is related to the behavior of the function when using a list as an indexer. The test expects an error message for a key that does not match any entries in the series index.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) and suggests aligning their behavior to be more consistent.
5. Based on the runtime values, the buggy function incorrectly infers the key_type as 'string' regardless of the type of key used.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs when a list-like key is provided. The function incorrectly handles the key in the `elif not is_list_like(key)` block and attempts to access the value using `self.loc[key]`. This leads to an error when the key doesn't exist in the index, resulting in a KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and align the behavior with the failing test and GitHub issue:
1. Update the logic of how a list-like key is processed to provide consistent behavior with other indexers.
2. Ensure that an error is raised when the key does not match any entries in the series index, as expected in the failing test scenario.
3. In the case of list keys, adhere to the behavior defined for other array-like indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Return KeyError if key not in index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys to check for the existence of the key in the index and raising a KeyError if it's not found, the corrected version of the function aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test scenario and addresses the reported inconsistency in the GitHub issue.
