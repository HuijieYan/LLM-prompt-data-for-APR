### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The issue arises when a list-like indexer is passed, causing inconsistencies in how the indexing is handled.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test this behavior when using different types of indexers.
4. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when using a list-like indexer, as it fails to find the values in the index.
5. The root cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the issue mentioned in the GitHub report:
1. Ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers to avoid inconsistencies.
2. Update the logic to appropriately handle list-like indexers to prevent KeyError issues.
3. Make sure the behavior is aligned with user expectations and the existing functionality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the logic in `_get_with` and ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers, the corrected function should now correctly handle the provided indexers and pass the failing test.
