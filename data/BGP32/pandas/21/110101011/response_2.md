### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc.
2. The function encounters an issue when dealing with list-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index) with a Series object, specifically mentioning that list indexers behave differently and may lead to unexpected errors.
4. Based on the failing test cases provided, the function fails to handle list-like indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError.
5. The bug seems to stem from an incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the function, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of list-like indexers. The function is not properly distinguishing between different types of indexers, causing a KeyError when using list-like indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.
2. Ensure that list-like indexers are properly converted to a format compatible with the Series index for accurate retrieval of values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is in a compatible index format

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:        
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now includes proper handling of list-like indexers by ensuring they are converted to a compatible index format. This fix addresses the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and resolves the KeyError issue reported in the failing test cases.
