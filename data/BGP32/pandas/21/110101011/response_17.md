## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The bug appears to stem from the handling of certain types of key inputs, particularly when a list key is provided.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior for indexing using different types of key inputs (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). The bug causes an inconsistency in how the `list` key is handled compared to other types.
4. The bug seems to arise when the `key` is not recognized as an array-like structure, leading to a KeyError due to misinterpretation of the key.
5. The bug appears to affect scenarios where the key is a single element list, causing incorrect behavior when trying to match the index.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles list-like key inputs, especially when they contain a single element. We should align the behavior for all types of key inputs to ensure consistency.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the function as shown above, we ensure that the code handles list-like key inputs consistently along with other array-like structures. This correction should address the inconsistency and pass the failing test cases.
