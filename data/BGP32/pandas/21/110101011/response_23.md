### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing.
2. The function has logic to handle slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various other key types.
3. The bug occurs when a non-list-like key is passed. The function attempts to treat the key as either label-based or positional indexer based on its type, leading to an incorrect handling of the key.
4. The bug relates to the issue mentioned on GitHub, where the behavior for list indexers differs from other array-like indexers.
5. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` instead of `'object'`, causing incorrect handling of the key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to incorrect handling of the key type and the decision-making logic for treating the key as a label-based or positional indexer.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for identifying the key type and streamline the decision process for label-based or positional indexing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        # Modify the condition to handle non-list-like keys appropriately
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "object":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of non-list-like keys and refining the key type determination logic, the corrected function should now properly handle different types of keys for indexing in a consistent manner.
