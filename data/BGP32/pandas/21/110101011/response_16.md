### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input `key` values and obtain corresponding values from the Series or handle index-related operations.
2. The bug seems to be related to how list-like objects are processed differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError in certain cases.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to access a value that does not exist in the Series by passing different types of indexers, triggering a KeyError due to inconsistent handling of list-like objects.
4. The runtime values show that the `key_type` is incorrectly determined as `'string'`, indicating a failure in inferring the data type correctly from the input.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to stem from inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function, leading to incorrect type inference and KeyError when accessing non-existent values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list-like indexers and improve the type inference mechanism to correctly determine the data type of the `key` input. Additionally, we should align the behavior of all indexer types to avoid KeyError exceptions for non-matching values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Improved type inference mechanism
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handling all types of list-like objects consistently
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```
In the corrected version, we have added improvements for type inference and consistent handling of list-like objects, aligning the behavior for different types of indexers to prevent KeyError exceptions. This updated version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
