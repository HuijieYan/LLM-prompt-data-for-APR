### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is meant to handle different types of `key` inputs.
2. The issue arises when a list key is passed, causing inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of key inputs like ndarray, Index, or Series.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking the behavior when a key of list type (`key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)`) is passed to the `ser[key]` indexing operation.
4. The issue is related to how list indexers are handled in comparison to other array-like indexers, causing a KeyError inconsistency.
5. The key issue lies in the handling of list keys, leading to the need for consistency in behavior across different indexer types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the specific handling of list keys inside the `_get_with` function, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index with a list key despite expecting a consistent behavior with other array-like indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list keys along with other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the logic within the `_get_with` function to treat list keys in a similar manner as ndarray, Index, or Series keys.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with updated logic to handle list keys consistently:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list key as an array-like indexer
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the conversion of list keys to numpy arrays before processing, we ensure that list keys are treated similarly to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This correction aims to provide consistent behavior across different indexer types, resolving the KeyError inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
