### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input `key` values for indexing.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` is of type `list` and the function tries to handle it differently than other array-like types.
3. The bug causes inconsistency in how indexing operations are handled for different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in specific cases where it should not occur.
4. The test function `test_getitem_no_matches` fails because the expected behavior for all types of indexers is not consistent. The test expects that all types of indexers should behave like the `list` case, but the function implementation does not align with this expectation.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how indexing is handled for different types of indexers and questions the rationale behind this behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function treats a list-like `key` differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies in indexing behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles all types of indexers consistently. We should make the function treat all array-like indexers similarly to how lists are handled, in alignment with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that all array-like indexers are handled consistently, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.
