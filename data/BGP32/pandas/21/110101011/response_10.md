### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the series.
2. The bug is likely related to the way list-like indexers are handled differently than other types of indexers.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers, but the buggy function does not provide that consistency.
4. Based on the runtime values and types of variables, the issue seems to arise when handling a list-like indexer and determining the `key_type`.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When processing list-like indexers, the function fails to properly reindex and causes a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should treat list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers such as ndarray, Index, and Series. This involves ensuring that the handling of list-like indexers aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `if isinstance(key, list):` block to return `self.reindex(key)` for list-like indexers, the bug should be fixed and the function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexers.
