### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle indexing based on different types of keys.
2. The bug is likely related to how different types of indexers are treated inconsistently.
3. From the failing test, it appears that a list key is causing a KeyError when attempting to get values from the Series.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers.
5. The runtime values show that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which indicates a problem with inferring the key's type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function fails to properly process a list key when attempting to get values from the Series, resulting in a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This involves identifying the correct type of the key and processing it accordingly within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. By properly inferring the key type and processing it accordingly, the function should now handle different types of indexers correctly.
