### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The function checks the type of the key input and performs specific actions based on the type.
3. The failing test case is due to inconsistencies in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency and requests clarification on why list indexers behave differently.
5. The bug seems to stem from the way the function handles list-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function fails to appropriately handle list indexers, leading to a KeyError when trying to index with a list.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. The key is converted to a list when it is not list-like, but the subsequent handling does not cover all scenarios leading to the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert to list for consistent handling

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that all non-list-like keys are converted to a list before further processing, the corrected version of the function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError issue.
