### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing scenarios like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
2. The bug seems to be occurring when a list-like key is provided as an input. The function fails to handle this case properly, resulting in a KeyError.
3. According to the failing test case, when a list-like key is used to index a Series, the function should return NaN values for missing entries rather than raising a KeyError.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series, specifically mentioning the discrepancy with list indexers.
5. The key_type is wrongly interpreted as 'integer' when it should be 'string'.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the misinterpretation of the key type as 'integer' instead of 'string', leading to incorrect indexing behavior and eventually causing a KeyError for list-like keys.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the correct key type based on the input key value to handle different scenarios appropriately.
2. Update the code to ensure that for list-like keys, missing entries are replaced with NaN values instead of raising a KeyError.
3. Modify the key_type detection logic to correctly identify the type of the input key.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = self.index.intersection(key)
        result = lib.map_infer(key, self.values, na_action="ignore")
        return self._constructor(result, index=key, name=self.name)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments and ensuring correct key type detection, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys by replacing missing entries with NaN values, aligning with the expected behavior from the failing test case and resolving the GitHub issue.
