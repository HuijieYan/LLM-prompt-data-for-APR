### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers.
2. The bug seems to occur when the function encounters a key that is a list-like object, causing it to raise a `KeyError` incorrectly.
3. The `key_type` variable is being inferred as `'string'` regardless of the actual type of key passed, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers, and it mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, indicating the need for alignment in behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The key type inference logic in the function is incorrect, and it results in misidentifying the key type as `'string'`. This leads to the incorrect pathway being taken in handling the key, ultimately causing a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the key type inference to correctly identify the type of the key being passed.
2. Ensure that appropriate actions are taken based on the type of the key to avoid raising unnecessary errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By improving the logic for determining the key type and adjusting the handling based on the key's type, the corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistency in how different types of indexers are handled.
