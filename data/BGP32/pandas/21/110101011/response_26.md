### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library deals with different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc. The bug occurs when the function tries to handle a list-like key. The function mistakenly categorizes the provided list-like key as an index, leading to an incorrect path.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` targets this bug by passing a key as a Series converted to various types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series in different executions.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly categorizes the key as an Index type when it should handle it as a list-like key.
2. The function misidentifies the key type as 'integer' or 'boolean' instead of a general data type like 'string'.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle list-like keys by treating them as a list and correctly infer the data type of the key to ensure proper indexing.

### Bug-fix in the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = key.tolist()
        
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary:
The fix involves correctly handling list-like keys and inferring the key data type to avoid misidentifying it as an index type. After applying the fix, the function should be able to handle list-based keys as expected, passing the failing test case and resolving the GitHub issue related to this bug.
