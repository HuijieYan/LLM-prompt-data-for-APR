### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing. However, the current implementation has a bug where it does not handle the case of a list-like key correctly.
2. The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as an integer, boolean, list-like, etc., leading to an incorrect selection of the path within the function.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` fails when using a list-like key to index the series, resulting in a `KeyError`. The function wrongly assumes that a list key should be handled differently than other types of keys, leading to the issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles list-like keys and treats them similarly to other types of keys for indexing.
5. By correctly identifying the type of the key and then applying the appropriate indexing method, we can fix the bug.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer-string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle other cases where key is list-like or unknown
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the handling of list-like keys and ensuring that they follow the same path as other types of keys, we resolve the issue reported in the failing test. This fix will align the behavior of list-like indexing with the expected outcome.
