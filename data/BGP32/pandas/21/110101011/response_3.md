### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the bug occurs when a key of type list is passed, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys.
2. The bug specifically arises when checking if the key is not list-like, which should result in the key being passed to `self.loc[key]`. Instead, the function attempts to access the key directly without being processed properly for indexing.
3. The bug is related to the improper handling of list keys, leading to a KeyError when attempting to index the Series using a list key as shown in the failing test. The function incorrectly infers the key type as 'integer' or 'boolean' when it should treat it as a regular positional indexer.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that list keys are properly processed and passed to `self.loc[key]` for correct indexing behavior.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
The fix introduces a conditional check at the beginning of the function to properly handle list-like keys. If the key is list-like, it is directly passed to `self.loc[key]` for indexing without inferring the type or going through unnecessary conversions. This ensures that list keys are handled consistently and correctly for indexing the Series.
