### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object.
2. The issue arises when a list-like key is provided, as the function is not properly handling the list case.
3. The bug causes a KeyError when trying to index using a list key, unlike other indexers such as array-like or Index objects.
4. To fix the bug, the function should handle list-like keys in a similar manner to other indexers like arrays or Index objects.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the check for list-like keys and converting them to a list, the function can now handle list indexers similarly to other types of indexers. This fix aligns the behavior with other indexers, resolving the KeyError when indexing with a list.
