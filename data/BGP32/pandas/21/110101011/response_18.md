### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, NumPy arrays, and more.
2. The buggy function encounters an issue when dealing with indexers of type `Index`, leading to incorrect behavior that results in a KeyError for certain cases, such as lists.
3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to the mishandling of list-like indexers, which leads to an inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly and consistently with other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list-like indexers and ensuring consistency with other types of indexers, the corrected function should now function properly and pass the failing test case.
