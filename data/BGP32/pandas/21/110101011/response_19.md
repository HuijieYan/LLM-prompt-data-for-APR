### Analysis:
1. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function is failing because the function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list correctly.
2. The function checks if the key is not list-like, and if it's not recognized as a scalar, it tries to use the `loc` method. However, when the key is a list, it should also use the `loc` method but it is not handling this case properly. This is causing the KeyError in the test.
3. From the provided runtime input/output values, we can see that the function incorrectly identifies the key as having a type of 'string', leading to the wrong behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a list, it is treated correctly and passed to the `loc` method for indexing.

### Suggestions for Fix:
1. Check if the key is a list and if it is, pass it to the `loc` method for indexing.
2. Remove unnecessary type checks and make the handling of list-like keys consistent.
3. Update the logic to handle list key indexing appropriately to align with the test expectations.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, it should now correctly handle list-like keys and pass them to the `loc` method for indexing, resolving the issue reported in the test case.
