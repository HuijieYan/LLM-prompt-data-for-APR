### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index.
2. The issue arises when an index key of type list containing a single element is passed, causing an inconsistency in how it is handled compared to other indexers.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `test_getitem.py` is designed to check the behavior when indexing with different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) that do not match any values in the Series.
4. The issue relates to how the key is inferred when it is a list, leading to a KeyError in this specific case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a key of list type with a single element is passed, the key_type is inferred as `'integer'`, leading to incorrect indexing attempts and eventually causing a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers with a single element correctly and ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred to handle the indexing operation based on the type of key passed.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to list for proper handling

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:  # Handle list indexers with a single element
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version specifically addresses the issue of handling list indexers with a single element, ensuring that the key_type is correctly inferred and the indexing operation proceeds without raising a KeyError.
