### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` inside the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs for indexing, but there seems to be an inconsistency when dealing with `list` type key input.
2. The bug seems to manifest when the `key` input is of type `list`, leading to a `KeyError` in the code snippet provided in the failing test.
3. The function is currently trying to handle a `list` key differently than other array-like indexers, which results in the error, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. The `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which indicates a problem in the inference logic inside the function.

### Bug:
The bug arises due to the function treating `list` type keys differently than other array-like indexers, causing a `KeyError` when indexing with a list.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers, including lists. We should update the logic to handle `list` type keys in the same way as other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all indexers consistently
    key = ensure_index(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By ensuring that all indexers, including `list`, are consistent in handling within the `_get_with` function, we can resolve the bug reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
