### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to process different types of keys passed to a Series object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, etc.
2. The failing test is indicating that when using a list as the key to access the Series object, it raises a KeyError, which is unexpected behavior compared to using other indexers like numpy arrays, Index objects, or Series objects.
3. The bug seems to be related to how list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function when trying to index a Series object.
4. The error message clearly points out that the issue arises when using a list as a key, triggering unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
- The cause of the bug is likely the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly processing list keys, leading to a KeyError when trying to access elements with a list key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The bug can be fixed by ensuring that a list key is handled correctly within the `_get_with` function. This could involve refining the logic for list key processing to align it with the behavior of other indexers like numpy arrays, Index objects, or Series objects.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

### Updated Explanation
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now correctly processes list-like keys by identifying them as such and following the logic for other acceptable key types such as Index objects, numpy arrays, or Series objects.
- By handling list keys appropriately and ensuring they are processed in a manner consistent with other types of keys, the corrected function should resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.
