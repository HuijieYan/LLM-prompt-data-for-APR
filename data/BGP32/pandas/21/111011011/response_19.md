### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The issue arises when the input key is of type `list`. The code path for handling a list key is not implemented correctly, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the problem occurs when trying to access elements in the Series using a list key, and the KeyError is raised due to non-matching index values.
4. The function incorrectly identifies the key_type as 'integer' when it should be 'string' for a list key, leading to the wrong indexing approach.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy `_get_with` function:
- The condition to handle non-list-like scalar keys and `loc` is correctly implemented.
- However, the block that checks if the key is a list or not and performs the reindexing operation is flawed.
- The code block fails to accurately differentiate between different types of key inputs, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Correctly identify the type of key input to differentiate between integer and string keys.
2. Implement the correct indexing approach based on the key type (list or other) to ensure proper indexing behavior.
3. Ensure that the reindexing operation handles list key inputs appropriately to prevent the KeyError from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Ensure keys are present in the index before reindexing
        missing_keys = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
        if missing_keys:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_keys} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing")
```

This corrected version includes appropriate checks to handle list keys and ensure that the reindexing operation behaves correctly for list input. Now, the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
