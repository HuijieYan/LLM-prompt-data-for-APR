### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, Series, Index, etc.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input key when it is a list.
- The error message indicates that when using a list as the key for indexing the Series, a KeyError is expected to be raised, but it is not happening.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the implementation for indexing with a list key is not handling the list key correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.
- The function is failing to properly handle the case where the key is a list, resulting in the incorrect behavior observed during the failing tests.

### Suggested Fix Strategy
- We need to ensure that when the input key is a list, it is properly handled to match the expected behavior specified in the failing tests.
- The logic for indexing with a list key needs to be corrected to raise a KeyError as expected when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.is_unique:
        return self.loc[key]

    if not lib.is_scalar(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary
- By correcting the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case when the key is a list, we ensure that the expected KeyError is raised when the key is not found in the index. This fix aligns with the behavior expected in the failing tests and the GitHub issue reported.
