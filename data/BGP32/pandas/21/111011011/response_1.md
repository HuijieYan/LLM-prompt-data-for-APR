### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a `Series` object.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that for some specific key types, the function is not providing the expected behavior, resulting in a `KeyError`.
- The failing test cases provide different data types for the `key` parameter and check if the expected error is raised when indexing the `Series`.

### Bug Cause
- The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like key that does not match any values in the `Series` index.
- Based on the failing tests and runtime variable values, the issue seems to arise when the key type is a list-like object. The function does not handle this case properly, leading to the `KeyError` exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like keys that do not match any values in the `Series` index.
- We need to modify the section of the function that deals with non-list-like keys to ensure that the behavior when indexing with a list-like key is consistent and does not raise a `KeyError`.
- The function should respond appropriately when indexing with a list-like key that contains no matching values in the `Series` index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Description of Changes
- Added a check before the final return for a list-like key to verify if any element in the key is present in the `Series` index.
- If none of the elements in the list-like key are present in the index, a `KeyError` is raised with a message indicating the key values that are not in the index.
- This modification ensures that indexing with a list-like key that has no matches in the `Series` index will no longer result in a `KeyError` and will provide consistent behavior across different types of keys.
