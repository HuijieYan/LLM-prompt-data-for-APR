### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the issue arises when using a list as a key for indexing a Series. The error is caused by inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled.
3. The runtime values and types of variables suggest that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all cases, which may lead to the incorrect path being taken within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is used for indexing, it raises a `KeyError` because the implementation is different from other indexers such as arrays, Series, and Index. The incorrect identification of `key_type` as `'string'` may lead to the wrong branching logic within the function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) are handled consistently to avoid raising `KeyError` when using a list key.
2. Correctly identify the type of the key input to determine the appropriate indexing method.
3. Update the logic to handle list-like keys in a similar fashion to other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):  # Check if key is list-like
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case for all types of key
    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
