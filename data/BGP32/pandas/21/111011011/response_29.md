### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`. However, there is a discrepancy in how a list key is treated compared to other types like ndarray, Index, and Series. This inconsistency is leading to test failures because list key indexing results in a `KeyError` while other key types do not exhibit this behavior.

The key issue lies in the handling of the `key_type` when the key is a list. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'integer'` which leads to the wrong indexing approach. This incorrect identification causes the function to eventually reindex the key, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by wrongly identifying the `key_type` for a list-key as `'integer'` instead of handling it as 'label-based' indexing. This wrong identification leads to the incorrect choice of indexing method, ultimately causing the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify that the issue lies in the incorrect identification of the `key_type` for list keys.
2. Modify the logic to check for list keys earlier and treat them as label-based indexing.
3. Ensure that the chosen indexing method aligns with the expected behavior of indexing a `Series` with a list key.
4. Update the function to handle list keys appropriately without raising a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list keys as label-based indexing
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list keys appropriately as label-based indexing, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
