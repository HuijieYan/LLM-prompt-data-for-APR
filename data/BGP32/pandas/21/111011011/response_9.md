The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list-like indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers. The problem specifically occurs when trying to access elements that are not present in the Series index using a list-like key.

The buggy function currently fails to handle certain cases where list-like keys are used, resulting in a KeyError. To fix this issue and align the behavior with other types of indexers, we need to modify the function to properly handle list-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added checks for scalar keys and boolean keys to ensure that they are properly handled. This modification should address the issue where list-like keys were causing a KeyError. Now, the function will return the appropriate values for list-like keys as well as other types of keys, maintaining a consistent behavior across different indexers.
