### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers (`key`) such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and various array-like structures.
2. The error occurs when trying to access a non-existent index value, resulting in a `KeyError`.
3. The function checks the type of `key` and then processes it accordingly. In the failing test cases, the key is an array, index, or series, leading to different behaviors and the subsequent error.
4. The key issue is related to how list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. When passing a list indexer, the `_get_with` function tries to locate the values in the index directly, leading to a `KeyError` if not found. This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including lists, are processed consistently. This can be achieved by handling list indexers similarly to other array-like indexers to maintain uniform behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.array
    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling all indexers uniformly and converting them to a consistent format before processing, the corrected version of the function should address the issue and pass the failing tests.
