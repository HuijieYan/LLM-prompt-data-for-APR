### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The function checks if the key is a slice, a tuple, a DataFrame, a list, or other indexable types, and performs the corresponding operation.

The error occurs when indexing with a list key, specifically when passing a Series object as the key. The function checks if the key is index-like (e.g., list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), and when it encounters a list key that is not an instance of Index, it incorrectly tries to handle it as an integer key, resulting in a Key Error.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the key is a list `['C']`. The function wrongly infers the key type as `'string'` instead of recognizing it as a list-like key.
2. In Case 2, the key is an ndarray array `array(['C'], dtype=object)`. The function again infers the key type as `'string'` instead of recognizing it as an array-like key.
3. In Case 3, the key is an Index object `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`. The function successfully identifies the key type, but the subsequent handling results in an incorrect key lookup.
4. In Case 4, the key is a Series object `0    C dtype: object`. The function fails to recognize this as a list-like key and attempts to access the key as a single value, leading to a KeyError.

The function fails to correctly handle list-like keys that are not instances of Index, resulting in KeyError during indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is encountered, we should check if it is an instance of Index (or similar), and if not, treat it as a list-like key for indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle list-like keys that are not instances of Index by converting them into a list for indexing. This fix ensures that list-like keys are correctly processed without causing KeyError.
