### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the key is a list properly.
2. The error message indicates that when using a list as a key, the function does not return the expected result and raises a KeyError.
3. The runtime values and types show that the function incorrectly infers the key_type as 'string' in all cases, which is inaccurate.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the improper handling of keys that are lists in the `_get_with` function. The function fails to appropriately process list keys, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access the Series with a list key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list keys like other array-like indexers. This involves ensuring that list keys are processed correctly and do not trigger a KeyError. 

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, list keys will be treated similarly to other array-like indexers, preventing the KeyError issue. This update aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, resolving the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
