### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
2. The function handles different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and different array-like objects.
3. The failing test is related to indexing a Series with a non-matching key.
4. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as 'string' in each case, which indicates a flaw in the logic for determining the key type.
5. The error message suggests that the behavior for list-like indexers is inconsistent compared to other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError.
6. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other types and suggests aligning the behavior to the list indexer.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect inference of the key_type as 'string' regardless of the type of key provided, leading to incorrect handling of the key and resulting in a KeyError when indexing with a list-like object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the key_type based on the type of the key provided. We should ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, aligning them with the current behavior of list-like indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function ensures that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the type of key provided and handles all types of indexers consistently to avoid the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests.
