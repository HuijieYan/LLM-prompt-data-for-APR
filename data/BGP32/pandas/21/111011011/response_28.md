### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` is failing to handle list indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` exception when accessing the Series with a list key. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers (array-like, Index, Series) are handled. The issue can be traced to the implementation of the `elif not is_list_like(key)` block in the function, which currently tries to access the Series using `self.loc[key]`, leading to the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like key types in the `_get_with` function. When encountering a list key, the function incorrectly attempts to use label-based indexing (`self.loc[key]`) instead of falling back to positional indexing. This leads to a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify how list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should check if the key is a list and then use positional indexing (`self.iloc[key]`) if the index does not support label-based indexing. This approach aligns with the behavior of other indexers and should resolve the KeyError issues encountered when using list keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes outlined above, we ensure that list-like keys are correctly handled using positional indexing (`self.iloc[key]`) when needed, resolving the KeyError issues and ensuring consistency with other types of indexers in Pandas.
