### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. When using a list-like object as an indexer, the behavior is inconsistent, leading to a `KeyError`. The issue lies in how different types of indexers are handled within the function.

1. The function checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or not list-like.
2. If the key is not list-like, and it's not recognized as a scalar, it tries to access the index using `self.loc[key]`.
3. If the key is an integer, it decides whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`).
4. The bug arises when dealing with a list-like key. The function wrongly assumes that the key is a single label, leading to the `KeyError` as it treats the entire list as a single label instead of individual keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should handle list-like keys correctly, treating each element of the list as a single key rather than assuming the entire list is a single label. This can be done by iterating over the list and indexing one by one, similar to how other indexers are handled within the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        result = []
        for k in key:
            if is_integer(k):
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    result.append(self.loc[k])
                else:
                    result.append(self.iloc[k])
            else:
                result.append(self.loc[k])
        return self.__class__(result)

    raise TypeError("Unsupported indexer type")

```

By iterating over each element of the list-like key and handling indexing appropriately for each element, the corrected function should now properly handle list-like keys and no longer raise a `KeyError`.
