### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The issue arises when using a list key for indexing, where the function falls back to the `self.loc[key]` statement, causing a `KeyError` when the key values are not found in the index.
3. The bug is confirmed by the failing test cases, where different types of keys are tested for indexing and the behavior is inconsistent for list keys.
4. The key_type is incorrectly identified as 'string' for all cases, which does not match the actual type of the input keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, resulting in a `KeyError` when attempting to index using a list key.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly within the `_get_with` function, avoiding the `KeyError` when the key values are not present in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type != "boolean":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` and adjusting the conditional statements for handling list-like keys, we can address the bug and ensure consistent behavior for indexing Series objects with different key types.
