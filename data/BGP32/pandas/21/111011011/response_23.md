### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs to retrieve values from a Series object. However, the bug seems to be related to how list type keys are handled compared to other types like ndarray, Index, or Series objects. The failing tests indicate that when using a list key, the function raises a KeyError instead of returning the appropriate value.

The relevant variables in the function include `key` (the input key), `key_type` (the inferred type of the key), and the conditional statements that determine how to process the key based on its type.

### Cause of the bug
1. For list-like keys, the function attempts to index the Series with the key directly, resulting in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how ndarray, Index, or Series keys are handled.

2. The key type is incorrectly inferred as `'integer'` in the last conditional block, which leads to unexpected behavior when processing list-like keys.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug:
- Change the behavior for list-like keys to properly handle them, similar to how ndarray, Index, or Series keys are treated.
- Correctly infer the key type to handle different key types appropriately.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, list-like keys are properly handled by using `loc` to access the values, similar to how other types of keys are processed. Additionally, the key type inference logic has been adjusted to ensure correct handling of different key types. These modifications should address the inconsistency and resolve the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.
