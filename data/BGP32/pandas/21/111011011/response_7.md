### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas` library's `Series` class is not handling the different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) consistently. Specifically, the function is not properly handling the case where the key is a `list`. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access the Series with a `list` key.

The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests that all types of indexers should behave like the `list` case. This means that `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` should behave the same way as `ser[list(key)]`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function is not properly handling the case when `key` is a `list`. It tries to process the key differently based on its type, leading to inconsistency in behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles all types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) in a consistent manner. The behavior should be aligned with the case of `ser[list(key)]` where the expected behavior is correct. This will ensure that the function returns the expected result for all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handling all list-like indexers consistently
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
```

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should be able to handle all types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) consistently, resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing tests.
