### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the different treatments of indexers based on their types. When the key is a list-like object, it is not handled correctly, leading to a KeyError in certain scenarios. This behavior is inconsistent with the treatment of other indexers like arrays and Index objects, which do not result in a KeyError.

The function checks the type of the key at multiple points, but the handling of list-like keys is incorrect, leading to the erroneous behavior observed in the failing test cases. The function incorrectly treats list-like keys as not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` and attempts to index `self.loc[key]`, causing the KeyError because the key does not exist in the index.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. Since pandas Series should accept list-like keys and handle them consistently, we can modify the key type check logic to ensure proper indexing based on the key type.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would involve identifying list-like keys correctly, treating them appropriately, and avoiding KeyError when indexing with list-like keys.

### The Corrected Version
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the issue with handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function and ensure consistent behavior when indexing Series objects.
