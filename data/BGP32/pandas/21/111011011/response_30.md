### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is designed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series.
2. The function checks the type of `key` and performs specific actions based on its type.
3. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue with handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The error message suggests that the `KeyError` is not raised as expected when indexing with a list.
4. The function seems to incorrectly handle the case when `key` is a list by not raising an error when an element from the list is not found in the Series index.

### Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the function encounters a list as `key`, it does not raise a `KeyError` if any element from the list is not present in the Series index. This behavior inconsistency is highlighted by the failing tests provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if any element from the list indexer is not found in the Series index, a `KeyError` is raised. This will align the behavior of list-like indexers with other types of indexers handled in the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    mismatched_values = [item for item in key if item not in self.index]
    if mismatched_values:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to identify any values in the list `key` that are not present in the Series index. If there are such values, a `KeyError` is raised with the appropriate message. This ensures consistency in handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.
