### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs like slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalars, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The failing test is trying to access a Series using a list key, which should return a KeyError if the key is not present in the index. However, the behavior is inconsistent when using a list key compared to other types of keys.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like keys compared to other key types.
4. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected for list keys that are not present in the index.
5. It is essential to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle list keys correctly, causing inconsistent behavior compared to other key types. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError not being raised when trying to access a key that is not present in the index using a list.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function to provide consistent behavior across different key types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list-like keys are correctly handled and consistent behavior is maintained across different key types, this corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug and make the function behave as expected when accessing a Series with a list key that is not present in the index.
