### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is intended to process different types of input `key` and return the corresponding values. There are specific branches for different types like `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, etc.
   
2. The error occurs when `key` is a list and it is passed to the `reindex` function, leading to a KeyError.

3. The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different indexers (`list`, `array-like`, `Index`, `Series`). When `key` is a list, the error is raised because the list indexer case is not handled consistently compared to the other types of indexers.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of `key` as a list is consistent with the other cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the code to handle the `list` case in a similar way to how other indexers (`Index`, `Series`, `np.ndarray`) are handled.
2. Modify the code inside the `if not is_list_like(key):` block to address the `list` type of `key` and return the appropriate result.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            key = key.tolist()
        else:
            key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `if not is_list_like(key):` block to convert `key` to a list when it's not list-like and tweaking the handling of different indexers, the bug should be resolved. This corrected version should address the inconsistency and prevent the KeyErrors that were occurring with list indexers.
