### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of key input and perform the appropriate indexing operation. However, there are issues with how the function handles certain types of keys, leading to failures in the provided test.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for checking if `key` is not list-like (`elif not is_list_like(key):`) is problematic and may cause unexpected behavior.
2. The conversion of `key` to a `list` in the block `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` could lead to incorrect indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conversion of the input `key` to a list within the function `_get_with`. This conversion does not handle all cases properly, resulting in the failure of the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should adjust how the different types of keys are handled within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should ensure that the input key is correctly processed according to its type before performing the indexing operation.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle key as-is
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle different types of keys properly and pass the failing test provided above.
