The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the mishandling of different types of keys passed for indexing. In the failing test, an error is raised when trying to index a Series using a key that does not exist in the Series index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where the key is an object that does not match any values in the Series index. We can achieve this by checking if the key exists in the Series index before attempting to access it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the key exists in the Series index before trying to access it. If the key does not exist, a KeyError is raised, fixing the bug. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
