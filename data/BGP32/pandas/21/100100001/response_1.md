### Analysis:
The `KeyError` is likely occurring within the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` block of the `_get_with` function. This block is trying to handle cases where `key` is not a recognized list-like object.

### Bug Cause:
When `key` is a `Series` object, it is not properly handled in the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))`, leading to the KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the condition to check for `Series` separately and handle it appropriately.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.array

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version specifically handles the case when `key` is a `Series` object by converting it to an array before proceeding with the logic. By doing this, the KeyError issue should be resolved and the test should pass successfully.
