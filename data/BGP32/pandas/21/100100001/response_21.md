### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of the key and performs specific actions based on the type.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for handling keys of type `list` may be causing the bug, as it should not treat keys of type `list` the same as other types.
2. The reindex method at the end of the function may not be handling the key correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the function treating keys of type `list` as if they were of a different type, resulting in an error when trying to access values based on that key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that keys of type `list` are handled correctly and that the reindex method works as expected for all types of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list types to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Justification:
1. Added a conversion to a list for non-list key types to ensure consistent handling.
2. Added a check for keys of type `list` to differentiate between keys that need to be used with `loc` or `iloc`.
3. Improved handling of keys to ensure correct behavior for all types.
