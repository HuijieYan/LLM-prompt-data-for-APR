After analyzing the buggy function `_get_with`, there are several potential error locations that could be causing the issue:
1. The function checks for the instance of `list` but does not handle the specific case when the key is not present in the index.
2. When converting the key to a list, the function does not account for the case where the key might already be a list.

The bug in this function causes an issue when trying to access a key that is not present in the index. The function should handle this case to avoid raising a `KeyError` during indexing.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle cases where the key is not present in the index by returning `NaN` or any other default value. We can also simplify the logic for converting the key to a list.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key] # Convert key to list if not list-like
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key] # Convert key to list if not list-like

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.nan) # Handle missing key by returning NaN
```

By making these modifications to the function, it should now handle cases where the key is not present in the index and return `NaN` instead of raising a `KeyError`. The corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
