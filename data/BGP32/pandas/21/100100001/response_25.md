## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of Pandas is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing. The bug causing the failing test seems to be related to how the function handles a key of type `Index`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `elif isinstance(key, tuple):` is present before the condition to check if `key` is an instance of `Index`.
2. The `if` condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` checks if `key` is an instance of `Index`, however, the handling inside this condition might not be correct.

## Cause of the Bug:
In the failing test, a `key` of type `Index` is being passed to the `Series` object for indexing, but the key is expected to raise a `KeyError` as it is not in the index. The failure suggests that the `_get_with` function does not handle `key` of type `Index` correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles `key` of type `Index` correctly and returns the appropriate result when indexing with an `Index` object.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # modify to return the correct result for Index type key
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle indexing with an `Index` object and pass the failing test case.
