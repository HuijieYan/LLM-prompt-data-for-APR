### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug is likely related to the handling of the key types, specifically when the key is not recognized correctly.

### Identified bug:
The bug is likely occurring in the section where the function determines the type of the key (`key_type`) and then decides whether to treat it as a positional indexer or a label-based indexer. If the key is not recognized correctly, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect inference of the key type, leading to unexpected indexing behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly recognized and handled by the function to determine the appropriate indexing method.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that we correctly handle scalar keys, the above corrected function should be able to handle the keys correctly and pass the failing test.
