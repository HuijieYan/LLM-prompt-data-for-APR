## Analysis:
The issue seems to be occurring when the `key` parameter is a list-like object and the Series index does not contain any of the values in that key. The buggy function is trying to handle this case by using the `reindex` method which doesn't handle the situation correctly.

## Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. The condition where `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` is checked incorrectly.
2. The handling of the case where `key` is not found in the Series index.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug occurs because the `reindex` method does not raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index. This causes unexpected behavior when trying to handle missing values in the key parameter.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the function to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index. This will align the behavior with the provided test case where a `KeyError` is expected when the key is not present in the Series index.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError("Key not found in index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError("Key not found in index")
```

Now, the corrected function will raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the Series index, aligning the behavior with the test cases provided.
