### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The problem lies in the part where it checks if the key is not list-like (`elif not is_list_like(key)`). If the key is not list-like, it attempts to call `self.loc[key]`. This is problematic because sometimes the key could be a scalar that is not recognized properly and causes a KeyError.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the key is not list-like and is a scalar like in the failing test case provided. The key `["C"]` is being converted to a box (a specific type) and then passed to the `_get_with` function, where it is not properly recognized.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the key is not list-like and is a scalar value. Instead of directly calling `self.loc[key]`, we should handle scalar values correctly to prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        # Handle scalar values properly
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check for scalar values before trying to access `self.loc[key]`, we can handle scalar keys properly and prevent the KeyError that was occurring in the buggy function.
