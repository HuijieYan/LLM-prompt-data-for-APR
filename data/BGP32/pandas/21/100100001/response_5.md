### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexing keys for a pandas Series. It checks the type of the key and then performs operations accordingly. However, the bug occurs when the key is not list-like but a scalar. In this case, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError due to incorrect indexing.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the following code block:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that a scalar key can be directly indexed on a pandas Series using `self.loc[key]`. This assumption leads to a KeyError when trying to extract the scalar value as if it was a valid index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of scalar keys separately before trying to index the Series. We can check if the key is a scalar and then access the corresponding value using `self._get_value(key)`.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key): # Handle scalar key separately
        return self._get_value(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above correction, the function will now correctly handle scalar keys and use `self._get_value(key)` to extract the value of the key. This correction should pass the failing test provided.
