The bug in the provided `_get_with` function lies in the handling of non-existent keys when `key` is not a list-like object. The current implementation attempts to access the key using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index.

To fix this bug, we should modify the code to directly check if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it. If the key is not present in the index, we should raise a KeyError with an appropriate message.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Check if the key exists in the index before accessing it
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # Check if all keys exist in the index before accessing them
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"One or more keys not found in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function will now check if the key exists in the index before trying to access it, ensuring that a KeyError is raised with an appropriate message if the key is not found. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
