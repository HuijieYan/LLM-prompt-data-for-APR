## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle indexing operations on a pandas Series object based on the type of key provided. However, the bug arises when the key is of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series, as seen in the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches`.

## Potential Error Location:
The bug seems to be in the section of the function where it checks the type of key and tries to determine how to handle it. Specifically, the `is_list_like` check seems to be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function treats keys of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series as scalars and tries to access its values directly using `.loc`, leading to a Key Error when the key is not present in the Series index.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way list-like keys are handled. Instead of accessing the key directly with `.loc`, we should check if each element in the list is present in the Series index and then access those elements.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        # Iterate over the elements in the list and access them accordingly
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition `if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series))` and handling the list of keys properly within the condition, we can ensure that the correct elements are accessed from the Series.
