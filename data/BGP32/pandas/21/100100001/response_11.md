1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used for indexing operations in a pandas Series object. The function tries to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, single values, lists, and numpy arrays. The bug occurs when trying to index with a list-like object that is not recognized properly.

2. The potential error location is the logic for handling non-list-like keys. The function fails to correctly handle the case when the key is not recognized as a list-like object.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys, leading to an attempt to use the `loc` accessor on the key. This causes a KeyError since the key is not in the index.

4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for non-list-like keys to correctly handle the case where the key is not recognized as a list-like object. We should treat non-list-like keys as single values and try indexing using `loc` or `iloc` based on the type of key.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles non-list-like keys by converting them into a list before further processing. It also correctly differentiates between single values and list-like objects when performing the indexing operation.
