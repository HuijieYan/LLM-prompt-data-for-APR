## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key when it is provided as a list, array, Index, or Series.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error location seems to be in the section where the function checks if the key is not list-like and then tries to use `self.loc[key]`. This causes a KeyError to be raised when the key is not found in the index.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to access a key that is not present in the index of the Series object. This causes the function to raise a KeyError when trying to access an element that does not exist.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function handles the case when the key is not found in the index. Instead of directly accessing the key using `self.loc[key]`, we can first check if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else self.reindex([key])

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else self.reindex([key])
        else:
            return self.iloc[key] if key in self.index else self.reindex([key])

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key] if all(k in self.index for k in key) else self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, we are first checking if the key exists in the index using `key in self.index` before attempting to access it. If the key is not found in the index, we are then using `self.reindex([key])` or `self.reindex(key)` to handle the case where the key is not present in the index.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided in the question.
