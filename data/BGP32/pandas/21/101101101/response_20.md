## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from how it handles the `key` parameter. When the key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function proceeds to check if the key is an integer, and then decides whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`). However, if the key is not a list-like object and not an integer, the function incorrectly proceeds to reindex the key.

This behavior causes an issue when the key is a `Series` object (`Index(['C'], dtype='object')` in this case) and not a recognized list-like object. The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'` and then attempts to reindex, leading to a `KeyError` as the key `'C'` is not found in the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to address the case where the key is a `Series` object but not recognized as a list-like object. Instead of proceeding to reindex, we should handle this case differently to ensure the correct behavior.

## The corrected version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Updated handling for Series object
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key.values]  # Extract values from the Series

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding specific handling for the case when `key` is a `Series` object, we extract the values from the `Series` and perform the `loc` operation using those values. This ensures that the correct behavior is maintained and the `KeyError` is avoided.
