### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not a list-like object. When the key is not list-like, the function attempts to access `self.loc[key]` without properly handling the case where the key might not exist in the index. This leads to a KeyError being raised in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key might not exist in the index before attempting to access `self.loc[key]`. We can use a try-except block to catch the KeyError and then handle it appropriately.
Let's correct the function by adding a try-except block to handle the KeyError and return the desired behavior when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the try-except block, we catch the KeyError that might occur when accessing `self.loc[key]` and handle it by falling back to `self.reindex(key)`. This ensures that the function behaves correctly even when the key is not found in the index.
