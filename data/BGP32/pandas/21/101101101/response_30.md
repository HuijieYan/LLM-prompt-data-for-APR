### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable. The `key_type` is erroneously set to `'integer'` when it should be `'string'` based on the runtime variable values provided. This causes the function to choose the wrong path in deciding whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`), leading to a KeyError in the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of key provided. Since the input key in the failing test is of type string, the `key_type` should be set to `'string'` instead of `'integer'. By updating the logic to handle the correct key type, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
         # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
         return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By updating the code as shown above, the corrected function should now correctly handle the key type inference and resolve the issue, allowing the failing tests to pass successfully.
