The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to incorrect handling of the key type in certain cases. Below are the steps to fix the bug:

1. On analysis, we can see that the bug occurs when the key type is recognized as `'string'` instead of `'object'`. This leads to incorrect branching in the code which results in a `KeyError`.
2. The issue lies in the method `lib.infer_dtype()` which incorrectly infers the type.
3. The bug causes the function to return with the wrong key type, leading to inappropriate indexing and resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. To fix the bug, we should address the incorrect key type inference by explicitly setting the key type based on the input. We can directly determine if the key is an object type rather than relying on inference.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = "object"
    else:
        key_type = "object" if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)) else "integer"

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version explicitly sets the key type based on the input, avoiding the faulty inference and ensuring appropriate indexing. Now, the function should pass the failing test cases.
