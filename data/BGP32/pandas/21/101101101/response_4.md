### Correction:

The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of different types of `key` inputs. The issue arises when the `key` is not recognized properly as a list-like object, leading to incorrect processing and returning the wrong values.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key` variable is correctly identified as list-like and processed accordingly. We can achieve this by modifying the logic to properly check for list-like objects before proceeding with the indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list for consistency

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the logic to correctly handle cases where `key` is not list-like, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios and passes the failing test cases.
