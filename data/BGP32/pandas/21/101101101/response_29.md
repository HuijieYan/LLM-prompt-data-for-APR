### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not recognized as a list-like structure. In the provided code, when `key` is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`. This is incorrect because `key` should be treated differently in this case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is not list-like or recognized as a scalar properly. We should determine the type of `key` and handle it accordingly to avoid attempting to access `self.loc[key]` inappropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if key is a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Check the type of key to determine the appropriate action
        if key_type == "integer":
            # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # Handle the case of duplicate indexing
            return self.loc[key]

    # Fall back to reindexing for other types of keys
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check for a scalar key and returning `self.loc[key]` directly if it is a scalar, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly for all types of keys. This correction should address the issue and make the function work as expected based on the provided failing tests.
