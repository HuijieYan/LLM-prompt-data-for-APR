The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type when it is not recognized as a list-like object. The current implementation fails to correctly identify the key type, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to access the key from the Series object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled. We can achieve this by updating the conditional checks for key types and handling them accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have included a check for scalar keys using the `is_scalar` function to handle cases where the key is not list-like. We also ensure that the key is converted to an Index object using `ensure_index` to maintain consistency.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle different types of keys when indexing a Series object.
