### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of the key types. When the key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]` which may lead to unexpected behavior for certain key types. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled based on its characteristics. We can modify the logic in the function to handle different key types appropriately.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles different key types and ensures that the function behaves as expected for various inputs.
