## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing values from a Series object.

2. The function checks the type of the key parameter and based on its type, it determines how to retrieve the values from the Series object.

3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles a key that is a list-like object. The function performs different operations for a list key compared to other types of keys.

4. The function should determine the key type correctly and then use the appropriate method to retrieve the values from the Series object.

## Identifying potential error locations

1. The function checks if the key is a list-like object, and then proceeds to handle it differently than other types of key inputs.
2. The check for the list-like key may not be correctly differentiating between different types of key objects.
3. The handling of a list key should be consistent with how other types of keys are processed within the function.

## Cause of the bug

The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function incorrectly separates the processing of list keys from other types of keys, which leads to unexpected behavior when accessing values from the Series object.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Modify the function to consistently handle all types of keys in a unified manner.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key parameter and uses the appropriate method to access values from the Series object.
3. Refactor the code to have consistent behavior for all types of key inputs.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that all types of keys are handled consistently and correctly, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and align with the expected input/output values for the given test cases.
