The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers like slices, tuples, DataFrame, lists, etc., and return the appropriate data from the `Series`. The bug may arise due to the incorrect handling of non-list-like indexers.

### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when the input `key` is not list-like. When the input `key` is a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` or if it is an indexer that does not fall into the list, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index` types, then the function calls `self.loc[key]`, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug can be attributed to the conditional block checking for non-list-like keys not handling all possible cases appropriately. This results in calling `self.loc[key]`, which might not be the intended behavior for certain non-list-like keys.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that all non-list-like key cases are handled correctly. We should identify the type of key and then decide which action to take based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by properly handling non-list-like keys and accurately determining the appropriate action based on the type of the key.
