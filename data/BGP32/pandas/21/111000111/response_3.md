The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the mishandling of different types of indexers, specifically when a list-like key is used. The function incorrectly processes the key in a way that leads to unexpected behavior and raises errors. This bug is related to inconsistent behavior in indexing when using different types of indexers in a Series.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys correctly and consistently with other types of indexers. We also need to adjust the logic to properly identify the key type and choose the appropriate indexing method based on the key type.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
    
    if not lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._can_reindex():  # Check if reindex can be applied
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled properly and consistently with other types of indexers. The function now checks the key type, directs to the appropriate indexing method based on the key type, and avoids raising unnecessary errors. It also aligns with the expected behavior defined in the provided test cases.
