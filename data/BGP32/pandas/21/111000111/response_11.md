## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when a key that is an instance of `Index` is provided, leading to an incorrect determination of key type and the subsequent index access.

## Issues
1. The current implementation does not handle the case when the key is an instance of `Index` correctly.
2. The `key` should be converted to a list if it is not already a list or other specific types, but the way it is done in the current function is causing the bug.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` type, specifically when it is an instance of `Index`. The function incorrectly infers the key type and mismanages the subsequent indexing operation.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case when the key is an instance of `Index`. Additionally, the conversion of key to a list should be done in a consistent and correct manner for all types of keys.

## The Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Convert key to list if it is not list-like
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the handling of the key type and ensuring that the `key` is converted to a list only when necessary in a consistent manner, the bug in the `_get_with` function should be fixed according to the expected input/output values.
