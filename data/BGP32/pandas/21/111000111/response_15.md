### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for a Series object. The issue arises when dealing with a list-like key input due to inconsistency in the behavior compared to other types of key inputs. The bug causes unexpected behavior when a list is passed as the key parameter.

### Identified Issue:
The issue arises when a list key is passed to the `_get_with` function. This triggers the function to handle the key in a way that does not align with the expected behavior. The key is not properly processed leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in handling list-like key inputs compared to other types of inputs within the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to the incorrect behavior when a list key is encountered, violating the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to ensure consistent handling of list-like key inputs alongside other types of inputs. By aligning the processing logic for all types of key inputs, we can correct the behavior of the function and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle all key types consistently
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle list-like key inputs in a consistent manner with other types, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected across various scenarios, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
