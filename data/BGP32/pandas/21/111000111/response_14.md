### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of keys to access elements from the Series.
2. The function is supposed to handle various types of key inputs efficiently and appropriately direct the access based on the key type.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different key types, especially lists, causing inconsistencies in behavior compared to other key types.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring consistent handling of key types and resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function.
- Specifically, the function fails to correctly route the operations for list-like keys, leading to unexpected behaviors and potentially raising errors.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers, causing unexpected behaviors and inconsistencies in error handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function by applying appropriate logic to route the operations correctly.
- Identify the specific check or operation that leads to the issue for list-like keys and modify it to align with the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
- Ensure that the function behaves consistently for different key types, maintaining clarity and predictability.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, we ensure consistent handling of different key types and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
