Based on the provided details, here is the analysis, explanation, bug-fix strategy, and corrected function:

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series.
2. The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed, and it is not handled correctly causing unexpected behavior.
3. The function checks for various types of indexers including slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others.
4. The key issue relates to the handling of list-like key values.

### Bug Explanation:
When a list-like key is passed to the `_get_with` function, it is not properly handled, leading to incorrect behavior. The function attempts to determine the key type and apply the appropriate indexing method based on the key_type. However, the handling of Index type and list type keys is not consistent, resulting in the bug.

### Bug-fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly handled and the indexing is consistent regardless of the key type. We should make sure that the function can handle list, array, Index, and other types of keys in a consistent manner.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Expected Changes:
1. The correction includes handling list input keys by converting them into actual lists.
2. Additionally, the logic for handling different key types is unified to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

By applying the corrected function, the issues related to inconsistent handling of list-like keys should be resolved, ensuring expected behavior based on the input key type.
