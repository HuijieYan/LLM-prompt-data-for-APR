## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle indexing operations based on different types of keys. The bug occurs when the key is a `list` type, as the function fails to handle it properly leading to unexpected behavior. The failure to correctly process this type of key can result in errors and incorrect results.

The root cause of the bug is that the function lacks proper handling for `list` type keys. It mistakenly treats them differently from other types causing the function to not return the expected output, leading to issues when accessing elements using a `list` key.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle `list` type keys correctly. We should ensure that all types of keys are processed consistently and returned as expected. By adjusting the logic for handling `list` type keys, we can address the issue and align it with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

The corrected code now properly handles `list` type keys by converting them to an index using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent behavior across different types of keys. This fix aligns the function with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
