### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. However, there seems to be an inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, causing issues such as the one reported in the GitHub issue.

### Identified potential error locations

1. The function seems to have issues distinguishing between list-like and other indexers.
2. The check for `isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` might not adequately cover all possible valid index types.
3. The handling of different key types and fallback to label-based or positional indexer could lead to incorrect results.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug originates from the `_get_with` function's insufficient handling of different types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series object. Additionally, the logic for deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing might not always produce the correct results.

### Bug-fixing strategy

To fix the bug, we need to revise how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. This includes proper validation of the index type, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexing methods.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Correction Explanation

1. Updated the logic for handling key types to ensure proper validation and conversion to a list when necessary.
2. Removed the redundant check for `is_list_like(key)` and added explicit type check for `ABCSeries`.
3. Simplified the conditional branching and decision-making for positional vs. label-based indexing to ensure consistency in the returned values.

By applying these corrections, the function should now address the indexing inconsistencies mentioned in the GitHub issue and provide the expected output for different input key types.
