Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of key input, specifically when dealing with a list-like key. The bug appears to stem from the function misunderstanding how to handle a list-like key parameter.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the section where the function checks the type of the key parameter and how it processes it based on the type. The issue arises when trying to handle a list-like key input.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function `_get_with` is due to the incorrect handling of list-like key inputs. When the function encounters a key that is not recognized as a list-like or scalar value, it attempts to use the `loc` method on the series which results in an error if the key does not exist in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the key is a list-like input before attempting to use the `loc` method on the series.
2. If the key is a list-like input, handle it appropriately without causing an error due to missing keys in the index.
3. Ensure that the function correctly processes different types of key inputs without raising errors.

### Bug-fixed Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above fixed version, the function now properly handles list-like key inputs without raising errors when the key does not exist in the index. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure correct functionality for different types of key inputs.
