### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of keys and their corresponding actions.
3. Based on the expected cases and the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue arises when indexing a Series with a list key. The function should handle this case consistently with other types of keys.
4. The bug can be fixed by updating the logic for handling list-like keys to align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when it encounters a list-like key for indexing a Series. The function does not handle list keys consistently with other types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior and a KeyError in certain cases. The issue described in the GitHub problem focuses on the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling list-like keys needs to be adjusted to match the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. This involves ensuring that list-like keys are processed correctly and do not lead to errors like KeyError when indexing a Series.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index) or hasattr(key, 'inferred_type'):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list keys consistently and aligning with the expected behavior, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now satisfy the given expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
