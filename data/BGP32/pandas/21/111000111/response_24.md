### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling different types of indexers and not handling list-like indexers correctly.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of list-like indexers, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly within the function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `_get_with` not handling list-like indexers properly. This leads to inconsistencies in behavior compared to other types of indexers when accessing elements from a Series object.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are correctly handled within the `_get_with` function. We should modify the function to properly handle list-like indexers to maintain consistent behavior with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_array_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles list-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior when accessing elements from a Series object.
