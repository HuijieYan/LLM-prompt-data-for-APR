The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of indexers are handled. The function encounters an issue when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, leading to unexpected behavior.

The cause of the bug is that the function expects the key to be a list-like object when checking for list-like data types. If the key is not recognized as list-like, it falls back to using `self.loc[key]`, which may not be the intended behavior in all cases.

To fix the bug, we should modify the code to handle different types of indexers consistently and ensure that the correct method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of key provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles different indexer types consistently and ensures that the appropriate method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of key provided. It addresses the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring a uniform behavior for different types of indexers.
