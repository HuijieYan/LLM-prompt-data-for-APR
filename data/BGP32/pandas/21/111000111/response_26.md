The buggy function `_get_with` is mistakenly treating the input `key` as if it is expected to be an array-like index, causing unexpected behaviors. The function should handle different types of indexers correctly based on their specific types. 

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly handle the input variables. Specifically, we need to address the way different types of `key` are processed to match the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() or is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle different types of indexers appropriately based on their specific types, ensuring that the function adheres to the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
