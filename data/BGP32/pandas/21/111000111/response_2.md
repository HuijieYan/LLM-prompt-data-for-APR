### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, there seems to be an inconsistency with how list-like and array-like indexers are handled.
2. The function is expecting `key` to be of type `list`, but it is also checking for other types such as `Index`, `np.ndarray`, and `Series`, leading to potential issues.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of certain types of key indexers, resulting in unexpected behavior when indexing the Series.
4. A possible fix would involve ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers and ensuring that the function returns the correct values based on the input key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle different types of key input appropriately.
2. Make sure to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types such as `Index`, `np.ndarray`, and `Series`.
3. Refactor the code to eliminate redundant type checks and enhance clarity in handling different cases.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the code logic, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types, resolving the bug and satisfying the expected input/output values.
