Based on the analysis, the bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class due to inconsistent handling of indexers for different types. The expected behavior should be coherent for all types of indexers (list-like, array-like, etc.). 

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that all indexers are treated consistently in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the `_get_with` function should handle different types of indexers uniformly to avoid any unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key = key.values
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ["string", "mixed-integer"]:
            return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for label-based indexing
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]  # Use iloc for positional-based indexing
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that all types of indexers are handled appropriately and consistently. It distinguishes between label-based and positional-based indexing based on the inferred datatype of the key.

By implementing this correction, the `_get_with` function will provide the expected behavior for all types of indexers as described in the provided test cases and will address the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior for different indexers.
