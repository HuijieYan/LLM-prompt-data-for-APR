### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The bug seems to arise from not handling the case where `key` is a list-like object correctly, resulting in an incorrect behavior when indexing using a list. This issue is related to how indexing with lists is interpreted differently compared to other indexers (such as arrays or Index objects).

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not properly handling the case when `key` is list-like. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to index the Series using a list, as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should specifically handle the case when `key` is a list-like object differently and ensure that the indexing operation behaves consistently regardless of the type of the key object.

### Correction:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function now explicitly checks for list-like objects before proceeding to handle the indexing operation appropriately. It ensures that indexing with a list will work consistently with other types of indexers.
