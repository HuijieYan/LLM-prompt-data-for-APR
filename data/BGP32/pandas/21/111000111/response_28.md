### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys to retrieve values from a Series object. However, the bug arises when dealing with non-list-like input keys, as it incorrectly attempts to access the key directly instead of properly handling it. This bug leads to unexpected behavior and potential errors when dealing with certain types of keys.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `if not is_list_like(key)` block of the `_get_with` function. In this block, it attempts to access `self.loc[key]`, assuming `key` is a valid indexer. However, in certain cases where `key` is not list-like, it should handle the key differently.

The bug results from the incorrect assumption that `key` is a valid indexer in all cases, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle non-list-like keys appropriately in the `_get_with` function. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should check the type of key and handle it accordingly for non-list-like keys.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including a check for scalar keys and handling them with `self.loc[key]`, we ensure that non-list-like keys are appropriately handled without causing errors or unexpected behavior.
