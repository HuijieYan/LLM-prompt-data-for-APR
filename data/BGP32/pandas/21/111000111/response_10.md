## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` to return specific values based on the type. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the `key` input and determines the correct type of operation to perform.

The function checks the type of `key`, and based on the type, it decides whether to return values directly from the Series (`loc`) or perform positional indexing (`iloc`). However, the issue seems to arise when dealing with a list-like object as `key`.

Looking at the expected cases and the related GitHub issue, it becomes evident that the current behavior of the function for list-like objects is inconsistent with other types of key inputs.

## Bug Explanation
- The function is incorrectly treating list-like objects in the `key` input.
- Inconsistent behavior occurs when list-like objects are used as the `key` parameter.
- The function should handle list-like `key` objects consistently with other types of key inputs.
- The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in how list-like key objects are handled compared to other types of key inputs.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function specifically for list-like input in the `key` parameter. The function should handle list-like objects consistently with other key types to ensure the correct behavior.

## Corrected Code
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version should handle list-like `key` objects consistently with other types and resolve the issue related to list indexers in the GitHub issue. It ensures that the function behaves as expected across different types of key inputs.
