### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. It checks the type of the key and performs specific operations accordingly.
3. The bug arises when dealing with a list-like key, where it fails to index correctly and triggers an error.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.
5. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of list-like keys when compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. It fails to index correctly and triggers an error due to a discrepancy in how list-like keys are processed compared to other indexers. The code fails to follow the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. Specifically, we need to address the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function to align it with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # New condition for handling list-like keys
    elif is_list_like(key) and not (isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the updated condition for handling list-like keys, the function now correctly processes list-like keys to avoid triggering errors and aligns with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue.
