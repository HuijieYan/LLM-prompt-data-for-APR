### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various list-like objects, for indexing Series objects.
- The bug occurs when the function encounters a key that is not list-like but a scalar or a single value.
- The function tries to index the Series using the key directly, assuming `key` is a non-list-like object without proper conversion.
- This causes an error when trying to index the Series with a single key that does not exist in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Explanation:
- When a scalar key is provided, the function currently tries to directly locate that key in the Series index without performing proper checks or conversions.
- Due to this, if a single key value is not found in the Series index, a `KeyError` is raised. This is not the expected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
- Before directly accessing the key for indexing, we need to check if the key is list-like. If it is not, we need to convert it into a list before proceeding with the indexing operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key into a single-item list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying the corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle scalar keys by converting them into lists before proceeding with indexing. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing test case.
