### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a `Series`. However, in the specific case of passing a list of strings as the key, it fails to properly handle it, ultimately leading to a `KeyError` being raised.

### Bug Explanation:
When the input `key` is a list of strings (case 1 and case 2), the function goes through the condition where it checks if `key` is not list-like. However, this condition is not sufficient for handling a list of strings. The function wrongly tries to use `self.loc[key]` to access the elements, which results in a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to specifically handle the case when the input `key` is a list of strings. The correct approach would be to convert the list of strings to a `list` object and then use `self.loc[key]` to access the elements.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle a list of strings as a key for indexing the `Series`, thus passing the failing test cases.
