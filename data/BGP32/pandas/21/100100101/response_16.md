## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to incorrect handling of the key type when it's not recognized as a list-like object. In the case of the failing test provided, the key passed to the function is an ndarray or Index-like object containing the value 'C', which is not present in the Series index. However, the function incorrectly expects the key to be a scalar that can be indexed directly using `loc[key]`, resulting in a KeyError.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles non-list-like keys, such as ndarray or Index objects. We should convert these keys to a list representation before proceeding with further indexing operations.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles non-list-like keys by converting them into a list representation before proceeding with further indexing operations. This fix ensures that the function can handle the input keys from ndarray or Index objects correctly, preventing the KeyError that was encountered in the failing test.
