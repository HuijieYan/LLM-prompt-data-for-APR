### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of input keys for a Series. However, the issue lies in the conversion of the key to a list in the line `key = list(key)`. This conversion causes an unwanted behavior when the key is not list-like, resulting in incorrect output.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the input `key` is not list-like, leading to an unnecessary conversion to a list which alters the key's original value and type. This incorrect conversion causes the subsequent logic in the function to fail and return undesired results.

### Fix Strategy:
- Avoid converting the key to a list unless it's necessary.
- Maintain the original type of the key before processing.
- Adjust the conditional checks to consider the type of the key appropriately.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Keep the original key as is
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function avoids unnecessary conversions to a list and handles different types of keys appropriately, ensuring that the function behaves correctly across various scenarios.
