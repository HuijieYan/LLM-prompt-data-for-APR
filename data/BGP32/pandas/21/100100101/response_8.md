### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be caused by improperly handling non-list-like `key` inputs. The function should properly handle the case where `key` is a scalar, convert it to a list-like input, and then proceed with the indexing appropriately.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test scenario provided, the key being used is a Series containing a single value "C" of dtype 'object'. This key is then converted to different types (array, Index) to be passed to the Series indexing operation.

1. For the case where key is converted to an ndarray and passed, the `key_type` inferred is `'string'`, which should correctly correspond to the data type of the key.
2. However, when key is converted to an Index and passed, the `key_type` is still inferred as `'string'`, which should also correspond to the dtype of the key within the Index.

The bug occurs in the conversion of the non-list-like key (Index object) where the inferred type is being mishandled, leading to the failure of the indexing operation in the `_get_with` function.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where a non-list-like key (like an Index object) is passed. It should correctly infer the dtype of the key in such cases and proceed with the indexing accordingly. The issue likely lies in how the Index object is being handled within the function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar to list-like for handling

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.dtype.type.__name__
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type for Index objects is inferred by accessing the dtype and converting it to the type's name. This change should ensure proper handling of non-list-like keys and correct inference of key types for successful indexing operations.
