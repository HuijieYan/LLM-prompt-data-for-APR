### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` values, classify them, and then perform specific operations based on the classification. However, in the provided buggy code, there is an issue with the handling of input keys of type `Index` or `ndarray`.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the current `_get_with` function is located in the following block of code:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```
The bug occurs when the input `key` is of type `Index`, which is not correctly handled in this conditional block. As a result, the `key` type is incorrectly converted to a list, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test case, when `key` is passed as a `Series` with dtype as `object`, it is converted to an `Index` type before this key is used for indexing the `Series`. However, the buggy conversion of the `Index` to a list in the function causes subsequent issues, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to properly handle `Index` type keys without converting them to a list. Instead, we should directly use the `Index` object for indexing.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # If the key is neither list nor ndarray, directly use it as an Index
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the conditional block to check for direct instance of `Index` type, we avoid converting the `key` wrongly to a list and ensure that the `Index` object is utilized correctly for indexing, fixing the bug.
