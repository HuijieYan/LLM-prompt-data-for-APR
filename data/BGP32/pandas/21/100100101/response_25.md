### Bug in the Buggy Function:
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is transformed into a list type. This conversion leads to unexpected behavior, particularly when trying to retrieve values from the Series. In the failing test case, the `key` parameter is prepared as an object dtype, which is then transformed into different types like a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The bug lies in the conversion of `key` into a list when the key is not recognized as list-like. This conversion affects the subsequent operations on `key`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should avoid converting the `key` parameter into a list unnecessarily. Instead, we should keep the original key type as much as possible to ensure the expected behavior when indexing the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By avoiding unnecessary conversion of `key` into a list and directly using it when not recognized as list-like, the corrected version of the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case.
