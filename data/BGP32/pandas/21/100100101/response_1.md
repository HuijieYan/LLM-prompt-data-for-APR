## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, it fails to correctly identify and handle keys that are not recognized by the `lib.infer_dtype` function. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior and the function fails when encountering keys that are not recognized correctly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function fails to properly identify the key type for specific input values like a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. This results in the function not reaching the expected block of code for handling such keys, ultimately leading to incorrect behavior and the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code responsible for identifying the key type correctly. We should explicitly check for keys that are not recognized by `lib.infer_dtype` and handle them appropriately.

## The corrected version of the _get_with function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes a check for keys that are list-like but not recognized as specific types (e.g. Index, ExtensionArray, Series). By handling these cases correctly, the function should now pass the failing test cases and correctly determine the key type for indexing.
