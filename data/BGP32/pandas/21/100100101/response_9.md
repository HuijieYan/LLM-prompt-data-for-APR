### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is not recognized as list-like and is passed to the `.loc` function which expects a valid key that is present in the index. When the key is not found in the index, it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the appropriate error message. This can lead to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not list-like and provide a more informative error message in case the key is not found in the index. We can achieve this by modifying the logic in the function to properly handle all types of input keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles the case where the key is not list-like by raising a `KeyError` with an informative message. It also continues to handle other types of keys as before. This fix should ensure that the function works as expected and passes the failing test cases.
