### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is a problem with how it handles non-list-like keys in the last part of the function. When the key is not list-like, it directly tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`. This results in a KeyError when the key is not found in the index, as shown in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when a non-list-like key is passed to the function, it is directly used for indexing without proper validation. This causes the KeyError during the indexing operation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper validation for non-list-like keys before trying to access the elements using `self.loc` or any other index-related operations. We can modify the corresponding part of the function to handle this scenario correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling scalar and unrecognized keys
    key = [key] if is_scalar(key) else list(key)
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the necessary validation for non-list-like keys, ensuring that keys are handled appropriately before they are used for indexing. This correction should now pass the failing test cases where non-list-like keys are provided to the `_get_with` function.
