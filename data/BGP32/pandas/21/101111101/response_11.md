### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function treats the key as a list-like object and tries to reindex it, resulting in a KeyError when the key is not found in the index. However, in the failing test cases, the key is not intended for reindexing but direct access to the Series elements.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the key is not intended for reindexing but for direct access to Series elements. We can achieve this by checking the type of the key and directly accessing the elements if appropriate.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key_array = np.asarray(key)
        
        if is_integer(key_array):
            # Handle integer indexing directly
            return self.iloc[key_array]
        else:
            if not all(self.index.isin(key)):
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle scalar values or unrecognized types
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making this change, the corrected function will handle direct element access for Series keys that are not intended for reindexing, thus passing the failing test cases.
