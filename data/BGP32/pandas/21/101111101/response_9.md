Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the input parameter `key`. When `key` is a list-like object that is not recognized correctly by the existing conditions, it falls into the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block and tries to access the `loc` attribute of the `self` Series object, resulting in a KeyError because `key` is not present in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to handle cases where `key` is a list-like object but not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. We can modify the function to handle this scenario correctly by checking if `key` is a scalar before trying to access it via `loc`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now handle the case when `key` is a list-like object that is not recognized properly and prevent the KeyError from occurring during the test execution.
