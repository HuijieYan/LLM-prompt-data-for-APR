## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of the input key types. The function checks if the key is not list-like, and if so, it tries to access the key directly from `self.loc[key]`. However, in the failing tests, the key is provided in different types such as a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. This leads to a KeyError because the function fails to handle these input types properly and attempts to access the key directly, which is not present in the index.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the different types of keys appropriately. We should convert the keys to a standard format before accessing them directly. This can involve converting various types like lists, numpy arrays, Index, or Series to a consistent format that can be used to access the data within the Series.

## Corrected Function
Based on the bug explanation and the strategy for fixing it, below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version first checks if the key is list-like, and if so, accesses it directly using `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not list-like, it converts it to a list format before performing the lookup operation. This approach ensures that keys of different types are handled correctly, preventing KeyError and addressing the bug.
