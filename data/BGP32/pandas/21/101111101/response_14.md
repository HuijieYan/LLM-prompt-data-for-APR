Based on the analysis of the failing test cases and the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to how the function handles the input `key` when it is a list-like object such as a Series or ndarray. The function is not correctly processing these inputs, resulting in a failure to raise a KeyError as expected in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list-like `key` inputs properly. The following corrected version addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label-based
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handling list-like key properly
    if is_list_like(key):
        mapped_key = self.index.get_indexer(key)

        if np.any(mapped_key == -1):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        return self._get_values_tuple(mapped_key)

    # handling other cases
    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like `key` inputs are properly mapped to the index to check for existence in the index. If any of the keys are not found in the index, a KeyError is raised as expected by the failing test cases.

By implementing this fix, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing tests.
