## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different key types. The function is designed to manage various types of keys for indexing, but it fails to correctly identify the type of the key in certain cases, leading to an error. Specifically, when a scalar key is passed that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`, the function tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`. However, this approach fails for certain scalar keys causing a KeyError to be raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key is correctly identified and processed based on its type. We can modify the logic within the function to handle scalar keys that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, we have added a check for scalar keys using the `is_scalar` function and accessed them directly using `loc[key]` to prevent the KeyError that was occurring before. This modification ensures that scalar keys are handled correctly and resolves the bug presented in the failing tests.
