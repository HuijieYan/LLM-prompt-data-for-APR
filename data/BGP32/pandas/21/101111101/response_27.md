After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in how the function handles the `key_type` variable. In all cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly set to `'string'`, resulting in an error during the test execution.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly infer the type of the `key` parameter based on its structure. We can use the `lib.infer_dtype` function to determine the type of the key, especially when it is a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the correct type inference logic into the function, we ensure that the `key_type` variable accurately reflects the type of the `key` parameter. This correction should address the issues highlighted by the failing test cases.
