## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when the `key_type` is determined as `'string'` instead of `'object'`. This incorrect type assignment leads to the function attempting to access the key as if it's an integer, resulting in a `KeyError` exception being raised during the test execution.

The function incorrectly determines the `key_type` by calling `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` instead of considering the dtype of the key if it is a Series. This leads to the misclassification of the key type, causing the subsequent logic to fail and raise a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when `key` is a Series. We should check if `key` is an instance of a Series and then determine the `key_type` based on whether it is an Index or has an inferred dtype. By updating the logic to correctly identify the key type for Series objects, we can ensure that the correct path is taken for accessing the values.

## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the suggested corrections, the function will now correctly handle Series objects as keys and determine the appropriate `key_type` for further processing, addressing the bug that led to the `KeyError` exception during the failing tests.
