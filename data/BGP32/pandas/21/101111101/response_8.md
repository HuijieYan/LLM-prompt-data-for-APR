Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of the key variable inside the `_get_with` function. The function fails to handle different types of keys properly, leading to a KeyError in the test cases provided.

The key problem areas identified are:
1. The function does not handle the case when `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series properly, leading to the KeyError in the failing tests.
2. The check for whether `key` is list-like (`is_list_like(key)`) may not cover all necessary cases.
3. The return statements based on the type of `key` lack proper differentiation between different cases.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the handling of different key types and ensure that the function executes the correct logic according to the type of key given.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if key is not list-like using the following condition
    if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series))):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the key handling logic has been improved to properly account for different types of keys and return the expected output. This revision should help resolve the KeyError issues in the failing tests.
