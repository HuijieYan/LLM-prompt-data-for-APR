## Fixing the Bug

### Cause of the Bug
The error occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class does not handle the case when the key is an ndarray or Series. The current implementation only considers lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, and Indices and tries to extract the `key_type` based on that. When the key is an ndarray or Series, it goes into the final `else` clause and attempts to reindex, which leads to a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to add proper handling for ndarrays and Series in the `_get_with` function. We should check for these types of keys and return the appropriate result.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        # handle the case when key is an ndarray or Series
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we have added support for handling ndarrays and Series as keys, ensuring that the KeyErrors are no longer triggered in the failing tests. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for the given input cases.
