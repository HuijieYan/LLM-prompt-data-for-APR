## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when the key is a single item in a different data structure such as a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. The function incorrectly assumes that the key should be converted into a list in those cases, which leads to incorrect behavior when accessing the data.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the following part of the function:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```
Here, if the key is not an instance of a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, the function tries to convert it into a list. This conversion is unnecessary and problematic, as it can lead to unexpected behavior while indexing.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary conversion of the key to a list. Instead, we should directly work with the key in its original format without any conversion.

## Fixed Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary conversion of the key to a list, ensuring that the original key structure is maintained for correct indexing and data retrieval. The function should now pass the failing test case provided.
