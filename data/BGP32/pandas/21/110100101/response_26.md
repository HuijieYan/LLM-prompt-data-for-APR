## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The issue arises when trying to handle a key that is not recognized as a list-like object properly. The function attempts to locate the data corresponding to the key, but due to incorrect handling of non-list-like keys, it leads to a `KeyError` during execution.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys, including strings, arrays, indexes, and series, are appropriately handled within the `_get_with` function. We need to modify the key validation logic to correctly identify the key type and then proceed with the necessary operation based on that type.

## Updated Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # Convert single non-list-like key to list
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle the duplicate indexing case
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the updated `_get_with` function, we have included additional checks to handle different types of keys correctly. Now, the function should be able to handle various types of keys without raising a `KeyError` exception, thereby passing the failing test cases.
