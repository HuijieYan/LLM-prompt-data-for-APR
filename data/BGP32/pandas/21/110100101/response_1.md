### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a `Series`. It checks the type of the input key and performs different actions based on the type. The bug seems to be related to the handling of a key that is not recognized as a list-like or specific data structure.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. In this case, the key is converted to a list, but the subsequent handling of the key_type and indexer selection logic is incorrect, leading to a KeyError when indexing.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling keys that are not recognized as list-like objects, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, or Index. We should handle this case more gracefully and ensure that the key is correctly processed for indexing without leading to a KeyError.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle keys that are not recognized as list-like objects correctly and avoid the KeyError that was occurring previously.
