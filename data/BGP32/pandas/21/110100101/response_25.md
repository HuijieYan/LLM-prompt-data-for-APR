### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` and determine the appropriate action based on the type. However, there is a logical error in the `if` condition that checks if `key` is not list-like. The current implementation incorrectly attempts to use `self.loc[key]` which can lead to a KeyError if the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function receives an input `key` that is not list-like, such as a scalar value. In this case, the buggy function tries to access the value from the Series using `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not present in the index of the Series, it will raise a KeyError during this operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling non-list-like keys. We should check whether the key is present in the index before attempting to retrieve the value. If the key is not in the index, we should raise a KeyError directly instead of relying on `self.loc[key]`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in index")

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```  

The corrected version of the function will check if the scalar key is present in the index and raise a KeyError if not found, preventing the KeyError that was occurring in the buggy version. This fix ensures the function handles non-list-like keys correctly and will pass the failing test cases.
