## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to errors in certain cases. The bug occurs when the key is a scalar value that is not recognized by the `lib.is_scalar` function. This results in an incorrect indexing approach, causing a KeyError in some scenarios.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the incorrect handling of scalar values as keys. We should ensure that scalars are treated appropriately based on their type. By implementing the correct indexing approach for scalars, we can avoid the KeyError that arises in the failing test case.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function properly handles scalar values as keys and ensures that the correct indexing approach is used based on the key type. This should address the KeyError issue in the failing test case and make the function more robust across different types of keys for indexing.
