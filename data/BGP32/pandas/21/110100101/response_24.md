## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is failing the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` because it is not handling the case when the `key` parameter is not found in the index of the Series properly. It is trying to access the `loc` attribute without handling the KeyError that might occur.

## Bug Explanation
1. The test case is trying to access an element in the Series that is not present in the index. The expectation is that a KeyError should be raised with a specific message. 
2. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class currently does not handle this case properly. When a key is not found in the index, it tries to use it as a positional indexer by directly calling `self.loc[key]`, which leads to a KeyError being raised without the specific message required by the test case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case when the key is not present in the index. We should catch the KeyError and raise it with the expected message specified in the failing test case.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a try-except block around `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys and raising a KeyError with the expected message, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and satisfy all the expected input/output values.
