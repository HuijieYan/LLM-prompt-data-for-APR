The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the incorrect handling of the key type. The function mistakenly infers the key type as "string" instead of "object" when dealing with a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray. This leads to an incorrect path being taken in the code logic, resulting in the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified as "object" for the mentioned types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key_type = "object"
    elif isinstance(key, (Series, list)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the key type is correctly inferred as "object" for ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index, Series, and list types. This correction should address the bug and make the function handle the keys appropriately in all cases, passing the failing test scenarios provided.
