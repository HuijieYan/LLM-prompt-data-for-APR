### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, there is a bug in the implementation where the key type is incorrectly inferred as `'integer'` leading to unexpected behavior when dealing with non-integer keys.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect inference of the key type as `'integer'` in certain cases where the key is not actually an integer type. This leads to the function choosing the wrong indexing method (`.loc` vs `.iloc`) and returning incorrect results or raising exceptions.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred based on the actual type of the key being passed for indexing. We can update the logic to determine the key type more accurately and choose the appropriate indexing method based on the key type.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type inference logic and adding a condition to handle cases where the key type is recognized as `'string'`, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. This updated version aims to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values outlined above.
