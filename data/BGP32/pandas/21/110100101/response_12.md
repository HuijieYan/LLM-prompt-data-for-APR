## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas module is designed to handle different key types when retrieving values from a Series object. However, there is a bug in how it handles the key type `'string'`, resulting in a KeyError in certain cases.

The bug occurs when the key type is inferred as `'string'`, but the function does not handle this case properly, leading to a KeyError. The problem arises from the incorrect handling of the key type and the subsequent indexing operation based on that type.

## Bug Explanation
When the key type is inferred as `'string'`, the buggy function tries to perform an indexing operation based on the key type. However, it does not properly handle this case, leading to a KeyError during the indexing operation.

## Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of key types in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should add a condition to properly handle the key type `'string'` before performing the indexing operation. By correctly identifying and handling this key type, we can avoid the KeyError that occurs in the current implementation.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_with` function below.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check for the key type `'string'` and perform the indexing operation using `self.loc[key]` for this specific case. This modification ensures that the buggy function can handle key types correctly and prevents the KeyError from occurring.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case provided earlier.
