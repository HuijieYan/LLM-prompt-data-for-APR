## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing. The issue arises when the key is passed as a list-like object, which leads to an error in handling the indexing operation.

The function currently fails to handle the case where the key is a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. There is a check for `is_list_like`, but it does not cover all the necessary cases, resulting in the function not being able to perform the indexing correctly.

## Error
The bug in this function occurs because the key passed as a list-like object is not properly processed and results in an error when trying to index the Series object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all list-like objects, such as lists, ndarrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects, are handled correctly during the indexing operation. We can modify the function to properly handle these cases by incorporating a more comprehensive check for list-like objects.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the pandas library:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
            key = key.values
        elif isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key = key.values
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is list-like and not an instance of `Index`. We handle cases where the key is a `Series` or an `Index` separately to retrieve the values for indexing correctly. After making these adjustments, the function should be able to handle list-like keys appropriately.
