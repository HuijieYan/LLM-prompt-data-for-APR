The bug in the provided function is that the type of `key` is checked before checking for specific types like `Index`, `list`, etc. This causes issues with the flow of the function and incorrect handling of different types of keys.

To fix this bug, we should reorganize the condition checks to first handle specific types like `Index`, `list`, etc., and then have a default case for handling other types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
            
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function reorganizes the condition checks to first handle `slice`, `Index`, and specific types of keys, followed by a default case for handling other types of keys. This way, it ensures that each type of key is properly handled without any confusion in the flow of the function.
