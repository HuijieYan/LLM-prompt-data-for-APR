The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key types and conversion steps. The function performs different checks and operations based on the type of the `key` parameter, but the handling of these cases is not consistent. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is correctly identified and converted to the appropriate format before proceeding with the operations. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where `key` is a list, numpy array, Index object, or a scalar value (e.g., string).

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added an additional condition to handle scalar values as individual loc lookups. We also improved the handling of different key types and ensured that the function behaves consistently based on the inferred type of the key.

This corrected version should now properly handle the different types of `key` parameters and generate the expected outputs for the given test cases.
