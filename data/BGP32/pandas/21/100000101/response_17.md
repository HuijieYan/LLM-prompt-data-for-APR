### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. However, there are issues in the logic that determine the type of key and how it should be indexed.

The bug occurs when determining the `key_type`. It incorrectly assigns the key_type as `'integer'` in most cases, regardless of the actual type of key provided.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key input and handle indexing based on its type. The key_type should be determined based on the actual type of the key provided, rather than hardcoding it or basing it on incorrect assumptions.

### Corrected version of the function
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not key_type == "boolean":
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the actual type of the key provided, and it handles the indexing accordingly.
