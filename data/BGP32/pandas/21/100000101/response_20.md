The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as "integer" for all input types, including strings. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to slice or index the Series based on the inferred type of the key.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the type of the key based on its actual content. Since the key can be a list, ndarray, Index, or DataFrame, we need to check each type separately to handle them correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]  # Assuming strings should be handled by loc
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")

``` 

This corrected version includes handling for different types of keys, specifically addressing the case where strings should be considered as labels and not as integers for indexing the Series.
