## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. However, there are several issues in the function that prevent it from functioning correctly. 

1. The function checks if the key is an instance of different classes but doesn't handle the case where the key is a scalar value that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. This leads to an error when trying to index a scalar directly.
2. The function attempts to determine the `key_type` based on the input key, but it incorrectly determines the type in some cases. For example, for non-list-like keys, the function incorrectly attempts to use `self.loc[key]`, which may not work as expected.
3. There is confusion in handling different types of keys, especially when converting the key to a list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bugs in the `_get_with` function, we need to:
- Properly handle the case when the key is a scalar value by directly indexing the Series.
- Improve the classification of key types to ensure correct indexing behavior.
- Simplify the logic for handling different types of keys to avoid unnecessary conversions.

## Bug-free Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray): # Check for numpy.ndarray
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, Index): # Check for pandas Index
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = "string" if is_object_dtype(self) else "integer"

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Determine whether to use positional or label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above correction, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object and return the expected results for each case provided.
