### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, tuples, lists, arrays, and indexes, to retrieve values from a `Series` object. The bug is related to how the function processes list-like indexers.

The failing test is raising a `KeyError` because when a list-like indexer is passed to the `ser[key]` expression, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to an inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The bug is associated with the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers in comparison to other indexers like arrays, indexes, and pandas Series objects. This issue was raised on GitHub (#5880) as there was a discrepancy in behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers.

### Locating the Bug

The bug can be traced back to the section of the `_get_with` function where it checks if the key is not list-like. The function correctly handles array-like, index, and Series indexers, but it fails to properly process list-like indexers, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause and Strategy for Fixing

The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like indexers in a way that aligns with the expected behavior. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the conditional checks and the data retrieval logic within the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers the same way as other indexers.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the bug reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
