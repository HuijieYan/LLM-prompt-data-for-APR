### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for indexing a Series object with various types of keys.
2. The error message indicates that when using a `list` key to index the Series, a `KeyError` is raised because none of the provided keys are in the index.
3. The provided GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys. It specifically mentions that indexing with a list behaves differently compared to array-like indexers.
4. The bug causes an inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with a `list` key.
5. The bug can be fixed by handling `list` keys in a similar manner to other array-like keys.

### Approach for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the `_get_with(self, key)` function to treat a `list` key similar to other array-like indexers.
- Update the handling of the `list` key to prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Fixed handling of list keys
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic for handling `list` keys in the `_get_with` function, we can ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys. This correction should resolve the error and align the behavior with other array-like indexers.
