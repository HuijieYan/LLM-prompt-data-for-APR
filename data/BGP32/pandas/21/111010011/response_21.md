### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, data frames, tuples, lists, and others.
2. The error occurs when indexing with a `list` object as the key.
3. The corresponding error message indicates that indexing with a list is not handled correctly and is causing a `KeyError`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated and suggests that indexing with a list should be handled similarly to other indexers.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to properly handle indexing with a `list` key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the logic within the `_get_with` function that fails to correctly handle indexing with a list key. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access elements that are not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should update the logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure that indexing with a list key is handled appropriately, following a consistent approach with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_list_like(key)` condition has been replaced with `elif is_list_like(key)` to properly handle indexing with a `list` key.
- The logic for handling a list key has been updated to ensure that the key is directly passed to `self.loc` without modifications.
- This change aligns the behavior of indexing with a list key with the handling of other indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue.
