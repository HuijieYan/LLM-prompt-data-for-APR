### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is accessing elements from the Series using different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The bug is related to how list-like indexers are handled differently compared to other types of indexers.
3. The failing test indicates that using a list indexer does not raise a KeyError as expected, leading to inconsistent behavior.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior of list indexers should be consistent with other types of indexers.
5. The issue was identified and discussed in the GitHub thread.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the Series class. When using a list indexer, the KeyError is not being raised as expected, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers by raising a KeyError when none of the elements are found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if self.index.isin(key).any():  # Check if any element in key is present in the index
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check `if self.index.isin(key).any():` before attempting to locate the key, we ensure that a KeyError is raised if none of the elements in the list indexer are found in the index, thus resolving the bug.
