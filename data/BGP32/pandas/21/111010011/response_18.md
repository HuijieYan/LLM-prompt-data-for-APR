### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that when using a list as a key to index a Series, it raises a `KeyError` because the value in the list is not found in the index.
3. The GitHub issue states a discrepancy in the behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in error handling.
4. The bug seems to stem from the way list key indexing is handled in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when handling list keys for indexing. The function treats the key as a single value, rather than iterating over the list elements for indexing. This incorrect handling leads to a `KeyError` being raised when the key is not found in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list key is provided, the function iterates over the elements of the list for indexing, similar to array-like indexers. This change will align the behavior with the expected indexing behavior when using list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Fixed handling of list-like keys by iterating over elements
    if is_list_like(key):  # Check if key is list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this correction, the function will now correctly handle list-like keys for indexing a Series object, resolving the `KeyError` issue and aligning with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue description.
