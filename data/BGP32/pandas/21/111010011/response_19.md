### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers (like slices, dataframes, tuples, lists) to extract values from a Series.
2. The error message indicates that when passing in a list indexer, the expected KeyError is not raised.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically focusing on the difference in handling list indexers.
4. The bug seems to originate from how the function handles list-like indexers compared to other types.
5. The bug causes incorrect behavior when trying to access values using a list indexer, leading to failing test cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is mainly caused by the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function compared to other indexers. The function incorrectly handles list-like indexers, leading to the issue raised in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior with all types of indexers, including list indexers. We should adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers appropriately. We can update the logic to accommodate list-like indexers to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that list-like indexers are handled correctly and consistently with other types, this corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
