### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` inside the `Series` class is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing tests shows that when using a list key for indexing, the code is not behaving consistently with other types like arrays, Index, or Series.
3. The GitHub issue mentioned that there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The bug causes discrepancies in behavior which leads to the failure in the test case demonstrating that the key is not found in the index.
4. The inconsistency arises from the conditional checks in the `_get_with(key)` function where handling for list-like keys differs from other types of keys such as arrays or Index.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of keys for indexing in the `_get_with(key)` function.

### Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with(key)` function to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types like arrays, Index, or Series.
2. Determine the correct behavior for handling list-like keys for indexing the Series and implement the necessary changes to ensure consistency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making small changes to handle list-like keys properly and consistently with other types, the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
