### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the issue is related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically lists.
2. The function `_get_with` aims to retrieve values from the Series using different types of keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
3. The error message from the failing test shows that the expected KeyError is not being raised when using a list indexer.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially lists, and highlights the need to align the behavior to avoid confusion.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling list indexers. The function fails to treat them consistently with other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and the KeyError not being raised as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This will align the behavior and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert to list for consistent handling

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By converting all types of keys to a list for handling, the corrected version ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. This change aligns with the expectations of the failing test and the GitHub issue, resolving the bug.
