### Analyzing the buggy function
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method defined in the `Series` class.
- The function checks the type of the input `key` to perform different operations.
- The failing test is related to indexing a `Series` with different types of keys: list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
- The bug is causing inconsistency in behavior for different types of indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The bug might be related to how different types of `key` are handled in the function.
2. The inconsistency in behavior could be due to specific conditions not being properly handled for certain types of keys.

### Cause of the bug
- The bug is caused by inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- The failing test in the GitHub issue showcases how the behavior differs when indexing a `Series` with keys of type list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
- The error message indicates that the behavior for list indexers is different and results in a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
2. Handle list-like objects appropriately and prevent `KeyError` from occurring.
3. Update the conditions in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of keys consistently.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to a list for consistency
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)  # Convert other types to a list
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle different key types
    if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes made in the corrected version
1. Ensure `key` is converted to a list when it's not a list-like object to avoid errors.
2. Use `ensure_index` to convert key to an Index to handle different types consistently.
3. Handle different key types based on the inferred dtype.
4. Return appropriate indexing based on the key type to ensure consistency.
