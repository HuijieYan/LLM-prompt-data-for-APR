### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

1. **Buggy Function**:
   - The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class handles indexing operations based on the type of the `key` provided.
  
2. **Corresponding Error Message**:
   - The failing test indicates a `KeyError`, where the specific key provided to index doesn't match any value in the `Series`.
   
3. **GitHub Issue**:
   - The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers and array-like indexers are treated, leading to unexpected behavior and raised errors.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
- The issue is likely arising from the handling of key types in the `_get_with` function, specifically when a list key is provided.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug results from a discrepancy in handling list indexers differently from array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected outcomes and raised errors, as described in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To resolve the bug, we need to ensure consistent treatment of list indexers and array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list and array-like indexers are handled consistently within the function, this corrected version addresses the bug and maintains uniform treatment as expected.
