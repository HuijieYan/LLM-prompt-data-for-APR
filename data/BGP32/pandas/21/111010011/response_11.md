### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` seems to be handling non-list-like scalars incorrectly.
2. The condition `if key_type == "integer":` is ambiguous as it's not clear how the type should be handled for integers.
3. The `return self.reindex(key)` statement might be problematic if the key is not handled correctly.


### Bug Cause:
The bug causes inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) in the `Series._get_with` function. Specifically, when using a list as an indexer, it fails with a `KeyError`, while other types are handled differently. This inconsistency is not aligned with the expected behavior, leading to failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent indexing behavior for all types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) in the `Series._get_with` function.
2. Handle scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` correctly to avoid errors.
3. Ensure clarity in handling integer type keys to avoid ambiguity.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is a valid index
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently in the `Series._get_with` function, fixing the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.
