### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is expecting different behavior when indexing a Series with an array-like index (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) compared to when indexing with a different type like `tuple`, `slice`, or `Index`.
- The failing test is specifically testing the behavior when indexing with a `list`, which is causing a `KeyError` to be raised instead of returning `NaN`.
- The bug is related to inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers.
- The issue posted in GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional statement checking for `not is_list_like(key)` which then falls back to using `self.loc[key]` when indexing with a `list`. This behavior is inconsistent with other array-like indexers and leads to a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` for missing values.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers. We should modify the logic within the `_get_with` function so that the behavior with `list` indexers aligns with the behavior when indexing with other array-like indexers like `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers when accessing elements in the Series. This way, the bug causing the `KeyError` in the given test should be resolved.
