### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) and returning the appropriate result by calling different methods internally.
   
2. **Potential Error Locations**: The error seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - When passing a list indexer, the function reaches the block where it checks if the key is not list-like. However, it should perform additional checks for detecting an indexer that is a list.
   - The error message from the failing test shows that the indexing with a list does not find any matches in the index.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
   - We should ensure that list indexers are processed correctly to avoid the KeyError when no matches are found in the index.
  
5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Added handling for list indexer
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            key = key.to_list()

        if len(key) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when a list indexer is encountered, it is converted to a list if it's a Series object before passing it to the `loc` method. Additionally, it explicitly raises a KeyError if the list indexer is empty to prevent the original issue with indexing.
