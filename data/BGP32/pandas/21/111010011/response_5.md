### Understanding the bug

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` package is encountering an issue when indexing with a list key. The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior is inconsistent when indexing with different types of array-like objects such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. The test is expecting consistent behavior across these array-like objects, but the current implementation is causing a `KeyError` when indexing with a list key.

The bug occurs specifically when indexing with a list key, and the code is not handling this case correctly. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of array-like indexers.

### Bug location

The bug is likely located within the section of the code that handles the different types of keys. Specifically, the code block that starts with `if not is_list_like(key):` and the subsequent block might be the source of the issue.

### Cause of the bug

The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the function encounters a list key, it uses the `self.loc[key]` method to fetch the values. However, due to the implementation issue, this causes a `KeyError` in certain cases, leading to test failures.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of array-like indexers. Specifically, for a list key, the code should use `self.iloc[key]` instead of `self.loc[key]` to fetch the values. This will address the issue and make the behavior consistent with other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, this line `return self.loc[key]` has been modified to `return self.iloc[key]` when handling list keys. This change ensures consistent behavior across different types of array-like indexers and addresses the bug as reported in the failing test.
