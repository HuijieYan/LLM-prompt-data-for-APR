### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling various types of indexers when accessing elements of a `Series`. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and then performs different actions based on the type.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The handling of `list` in the function might be incorrect.
2. The conversion of the `key` to a `list` might be causing issues.
3. The logic for determining `key_type` and subsequent actions based on it could be problematic.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case for `list` indexers correctly. The logic implemented in the function does not align well with the behavior expected by users, as highlighted in the GitHub issue. The error message in the failing test indicates that the behavior for list indexers does not match the behavior for other types (array-like, Index, Series).

### Bug-fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers. Specifically, we need to address the discrepancy in handling `list` indexers. Additionally, the conversion of `key` to a `list` might need revisiting to ensure it results in the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle 'integer' key_type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles list indexers and ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
