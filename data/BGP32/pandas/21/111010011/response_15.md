After analyzing the buggy function, the related class, and the failing test, we can identify the potential error location in the `_get_with` function. The bug is causing the function to behave inconsistently depending on the type of index passed (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior is inconsistent for these different types of indexers.

The current bug causes the function `_get_with` to incorrectly handle a list-like key. It fails to recognize the list key and does not process it correctly, leading to a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

To fix this bug, we should update the condition that checks for list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We need to handle the list key in a way that aligns with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise

    # Handle list-like keys correctly
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Default case for specific key types
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code:
- We added `ensure_index(key)` to ensure that the key is converted to the appropriate index type, handling list-like keys correctly.
- For non-list-like keys, the logic remains the same.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like keys appropriately, resolving the inconsistency in behavior and passing the failing test.
