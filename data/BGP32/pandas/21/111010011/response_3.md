### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects.
2. The bug is related to how list-like objects are handled differently from other types of indexers, such as arrays, Index objects, or Series objects.
3. The error message indicates that when using a list-like object as an indexer, the key is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers, which leads to unexpected behavior and errors in certain cases.
5. The bug needs to be fixed by ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers to resolve the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list-like objects as indexers in the `_get_with(key)` function. When a list key is passed, it is not correctly matched with the index, resulting in a `KeyError` because of the mismatch.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for list-like objects is consistent with other types of indexers, such as arrays, Index objects, or Series objects. This consistency will prevent the `KeyError` from occurring and align the behavior with user expectations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Ensure key is in list format for consistent handling

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is forced into a list format if it is not already a list-like object. This change ensures that list-like key objects are handled consistently with other types of indexers, avoiding the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test cases.
