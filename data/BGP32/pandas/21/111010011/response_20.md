### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing.
2. The bug is likely related to the inconsistency in behavior while handling the `key` as a list.
3. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that there is a KeyError being raised when using a list key for indexing.
4. The GitHub issue mentions that the behavior for list indexers should be consistent with other array-like indexers.
5. The inconsistency in behavior is evident in the failing tests, where using a list key produces a KeyError while other types of indexers do not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by treating list-like keys differently from other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for list-like keys is consistent with other array-like indexers.
This can be achieved by modifying the logic in the `_get_with(key)` function to handle list keys in a similar way to other indexers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. It ensures that list keys are processed correctly without raising a KeyError in the specific case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
