### Analyzing the buggy function:

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects. The function determines the type of the key and performs the necessary operations to retrieve data from the series.

### Error identified:
The bug arises when the function encounters a list-like key, leading to an incorrect handling of the key. As observed from the failing test, the error message indicates that the function is not correctly handling list indexers, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to retrieve data.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function incorrectly processes the list key, leading to a KeyError exception due to mismatching index values.

### Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list-like keys in the same way as other index types like numpy arrays, Series, and Index objects. By ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers, we can resolve the KeyError issue identified in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
- Compared to the buggy version, the corrected version checks for `not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index)` to correctly handle list-like keys.
- Removed the unnecessary conversion of key to a list when it's not an instance of list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.
- Modified the handling of the list key to align with other index types like numpy arrays, Series, and Index objects.

By making these modifications, the corrected version of the function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in the failing test.
