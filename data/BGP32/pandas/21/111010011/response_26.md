### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is used for indexing the series object with different types of keys.
2. The bug occurs when trying to index a Series object using a list key, which leads to a `KeyError` being raised, resulting in the failing test cases.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing Series objects with different indexers like lists, arrays, indexes, and Series.
4. The bug causes an issue especially when indexing with a list key, leading to unexpected errors.
5. The issue was identified and discussed on GitHub, questioning the rationale behind the differing behavior with different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list keys more consistently with how other types of keys are handled.
2. The key error occurs specifically for list keys, so we need to adjust the logic in the function to properly account for this case.
3. By modifying the handling of list keys to align more closely with other types of indexers, we can resolve the inconsistency and prevent the KeyError from being raised when indexing with a list key.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the `_get_with` function, we ensure a more consistent behavior across different types of indexers, resolving the issue that was causing the failing test cases.
