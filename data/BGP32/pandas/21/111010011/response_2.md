### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The issue arises when passing a list as a key, where the function is supposed to handle the inconsistency in behavior between using a list, array-like index, Index, or a Series.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is not properly handling the case when a list is used as the key for indexing a Series.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior between using a list index and other index types.
5. The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different types of keys for indexing, leading to a KeyError when passing a list key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` is not properly handling the case when a list is used as the key for indexing a Series. There is an inconsistency in behavior between using a list key and other types of index keys. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list key.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of keys used for indexing a Series. We should handle the case when a list key is passed in the same way as other index keys to avoid the KeyError. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the correction in handling different types of keys consistently within the `_get_with` function, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should now pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
