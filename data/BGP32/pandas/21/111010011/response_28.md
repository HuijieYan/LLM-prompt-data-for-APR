### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, tuples, DataFrames, and list-like objects. The bug seems to lie in the part of the function that processes the `list` type indexer, leading to inconsistencies and causing the failing test.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug might be occurring in the if-elif-else branching section related to the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with list-like objects.

### Cause of the Bug:
The error occurs due to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically when passing a list-like object to index a Series. The bug leads to inconsistent results when accessing items with a `list` key, unlike other data types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers, especially when using a list-like object. This will align the behavior with expectations and prevent the failing test scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like objects similar to other types of indexers
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Reindex if none of the previous conditions match
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
By modifying the handling of list-like objects in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version now ensures consistent behavior when using different types of indexers, addressing the issue raised in the failing test scenario described in the GitHub issue. This fix aligns the behavior with expectations and resolves the bug.
