### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`.
2. The bug is caused by treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistent behavior when accessing elements with a non-matching key.
3. The failing test expects the same behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series as indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers by handling them all in a similar manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function treating list indexers differently than array-like indexers when attempting to access elements with a non-matching key. This leads to inconsistent behavior and raises a `KeyError` when accessing elements that are not in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. By handling them all similarly, we can avoid the inconsistency and correctly access elements even when the key does not match the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = np.asarray(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "mixed":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we convert all types of indexers to NumPy arrays to ensure consistent handling. This approach allows us to access elements with non-matching keys correctly, resolving the inconsistency in behavior.
