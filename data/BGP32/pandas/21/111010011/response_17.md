### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling indexing for different types of indexers.
2. The failing test is related to the discrepancy in behavior between different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` is raised when using a list indexer, and the expected behavior does not match the actual behavior.
4. The GitHub issue points out that there is inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers (`Index`, `Series`, etc.) and requests for a consistent behavior like the list case.
5. The bug arises due to the different behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers without consistent behavior. When a list indexer is used, it results in a `KeyError`, while other indexers do not follow the same behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to standardize the behavior when handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, ensure that list indexers behave consistently with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    elif isinstance(key, Index) or is_index_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the key check is updated to include `is_index_like(key)` to ensure consistent behavior with list indexers.

By making this change, the buggy function will handle all types of indexers more consistently, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and passing the failing test cases.
