### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_with(key)` within the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module aims to handle different types of indexers to retrieve data from a Series object. The issue arises when using a list-like indexer, where the behavior is inconsistent compared to other types of indexers.

### Identified Potential Error Locations
1. The problematic section is:
   ```python
   if not is_list_like(key):
       return self.loc[key]
   ```
   This section is where the function falls back to using the `loc` indexer for list-like keys, which leads to the inconsistent behavior causing the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. When a list-like indexer is passed to the series, it tries to access the value based on the provided key using the `loc` attribute. This behavior differs from how other types of indexers are handled, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are treated consistently. In the case of list-like indexers, the behavior should align with how other indexers are processed to maintain consistency.


### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when a list-like indexer is passed, the function will use the `loc` attribute to fetch the values from the Series object consistently with other types of indexers. This fix will resolve the inconsistency issue reported in the failing test and align the behavior with the expected outcomes for different kinds of indexers.
