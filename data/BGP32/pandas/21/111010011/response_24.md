### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series.
- The error messages indicate that when passing a list, index, or Series as a key to the Series, the function is not behaving consistently.
- The primary issue seems to be the different behaviors when passing different types of keys, specifically when using a list.
- The GitHub issue provides insight into the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with list-like objects.
- The error message mentions that the behavior is inconsistent with how all cases should be handled similarly.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function.
- Specifically, when a list is passed as a key, it results in a KeyError while it should be handled similarly to other types like Index or Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent behavior for indexing with list-like objects.
- Modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list keys in a way that aligns with other key types like Index or Series.
- This may involve updating the conditional branches in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary:
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now handles list-like keys consistently with other types.
- The fix ensures that passing a list as a key to the Series results in a proper indexing operation without causing a KeyError.
- By making the logic consistent across different types of keys, the bug is resolved, and the function now aligns with expected behavior.
