### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class seems to be causing an issue when indexing with a list-like object.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior of indexing with a list is inconsistent compared to indexing with other array-like objects.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the current behavior of indexing with a list is different from the behavior of indexing with other array-like objects like np.array and Index.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the indexing is handled for list objects in the `_get_with(key)` function of the `Series` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling indexing with list-like objects in the `_get_with(key)` function. When a list is used for indexing, it does not behave the same way as np.array or Index objects. This inconsistency leads to an error when trying to access elements that are not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the behavior of indexing with list-like objects is consistent with other array-like objects like np.array and Index. Specifically, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with(key)` function to handle list indexing correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = np.asarray(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By converting `key` to a NumPy array when it's not list-like, we ensure that the behavior for list indexing is consistent with other array-like objects. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
