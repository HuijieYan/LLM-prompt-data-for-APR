### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The issue arises when the input key is an instance of a list, as shown in the failing test cases. The function does not correctly handle the list case, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block for handling list-like input keys may have a bug.
2. The handling of the list case within the function may need revision.
3. The `KeyError` is raised when the input key is not found in the index, indicating a problem with index matching.

### Bug Cause:
The `_get_with` function fails to properly handle list-like input keys, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to index the Series object. This inconsistency in behavior arises from a specific conditional block that does not account for list cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the section of the `_get_with` function that deals with list-like input keys. The function should handle list cases more consistently to avoid the `KeyError` raised during indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list cases for indexing
    if not isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle list indexing cases
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the function correctly handles list input keys, the corrected version above should resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered during indexing.
