### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of keys like slices, Pandas dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. 
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the issue lies in the behavior when indexing with a list or an ndarray, which are not handled properly.
- The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently compared to array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing elements.
  
### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it fails to process it correctly, resulting in a KeyError during indexing.
  
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The fix involves ensuring that list indexers are handled properly in the `_get_with` function. This means treating list indexers similarly to other array-like indexers to maintain consistency in behavior.
- The fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and ensure that list indexers behave as expected without leading to errors.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        # Handle list or ndarray indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version of `_get_with`, we added a specific check for `list` and `np.ndarray` indexers to ensure they are handled correctly.
- The fix ensures that when indexing with a list or an ndarray, the function will use `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values from the Series, maintaining consistency with other array-like indexers.
- By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now behave consistently and resolve the KeyError issue encountered when indexing with a list.
