1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library. This function is responsible for indexing a `Series` object based on the input `key`. The function has multiple paths for handling different types of keys, but there is a bug in how it handles keys of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are the following blocks:
   a. The block where it checks if `key` is not list-like and then tries to access `self.loc[key]`.
   b. The block where it checks for key type to be integer and decides between `self.loc[key]` and `self.iloc[key]`.
   c. The block where it checks if `key` is a list and then calls `self.loc[key]`.

3. The bug is causing an issue when indexing a `Series` object with a key that is either a list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, or pd.Series. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` instead of handling the indexing operation correctly. This results in the failing test case where the expected behavior is not matching the actual behavior of the function.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles indexing with keys that are list-like (including np.ndarray, pd.Index, and pd.Series). We should refactor the code to properly distinguish between different types of keys and apply the appropriate indexing method accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalars more effectively
        return self.loc[key] if is_scalar(key) else self.reindex(key)
    
    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.loc[key] if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() else self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

By implementing a more streamlined logic for handling various key types in the `_get_with` function, we can ensure that indexing with list-like keys works correctly and the failing test case is resolved.
