### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexing keys and returning the appropriate values. It checks for the type of the key and then processes it accordingly.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access an element that does not exist in the index.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles non-existing keys and triggers the correct exception to be raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the key passed to the `_get_with` function is not found in the index, but the function does not appropriately handle this case and returns the wrong result, triggering the wrong exception.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is not found in the index, a `KeyError` exception is raised as expected by the test. This can be achieved by modifying the last `return self.reindex(key)` statement to raise a `KeyError` instead if the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

### Now, when the key is not found in the index, a `KeyError` will be raised as expected by the failing test.
