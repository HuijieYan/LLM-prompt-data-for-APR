## Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is failing when the `key` is a list-like object that contains a value not present in the series index. The buggy function incorrectly tries to handle the mismatched key by returning the result of `self.reindex(key)`, which results in a KeyError when attempting to reindex an item not present in the series.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the incorrect handling of list-like keys that contain values not present in the series index. By attempting to reindex with the entire key list, the function throws a KeyError since it tries to access values not present in the series.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the keys that are list-like and not present in the series index. Instead of directly reindexing with the full key list, we should only reindex with the keys that are present in the series index.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    keys_subset = [k for k in key if k in self.index]
    if not keys_subset:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = keys_subset

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[keys_subset]
        else:
            return self.iloc[keys_subset]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[keys_subset]

    return self.reindex(keys_subset)
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle keys that contain values not present in the series index. It will only reindex with the keys that exist in the series and avoid throwing the KeyError.
