### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a Series.
2. The function checks for different conditions based on the type of key (slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list-like, etc.) and performs different operations accordingly.
3. The failing test is testing the behavior when trying to access an index that does not exist in the Series. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message.
4. The bug in the current implementation results from the incorrect handling of keys that are neither of type `Index`, nor `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`.
5. The existing implementation tries to convert the invalid key into a list without considering the original type of the key, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of converting the key to a list without proper validation, we should directly raise a `KeyError` when dealing with keys that are not of the expected types.
2. We should handle the case of scalar keys that are not recognized by the `lib.is_scalar` function separately to ensure correct behavior.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if not lib.is_scalar(key):
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not in the index")
        
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
    # For any other type of key, raise KeyError
    raise KeyError(f"{key} not in the index")
```

By directly raising a `KeyError` for keys that are not of the expected types, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle all types of keys and pass the failing test.
