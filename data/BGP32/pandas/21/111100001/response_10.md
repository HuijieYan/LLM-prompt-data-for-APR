### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
- The purpose of the `_get_with` function is to retrieve values based on the key provided.
- The bug seems to be related to handling the key type when indexing a Series object.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index of the Series.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type. When a key is provided that does not exist in the index of the Series, the function does not return the expected `KeyError`.
- The function does not properly distinguish between different key types, causing it to incorrectly attempt to reindex the Series with the key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles different key types correctly and throws a `KeyError` when an invalid key is provided.
- We need to modify the logic for key type checking and return a proper `KeyError` as expected by the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if key.is_boolean():
        indexer = self.index._convert_for_reindex(key)
        return self._reindex_indexer(indexer)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Updated Modifications:
1. Added a check to raise a `KeyError` if the key is not list-like and is not in the index.
2. Converted the key to ensure it is a valid index.
3. Added a check to raise a `KeyError` if the key becomes empty after ensuring it is a valid index.
4. Added a check to handle boolean indexing and return the reindexed values.
5. Reindex the key using the `reindex` method for non-boolean keys.

By making these modifications, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different key types and raise a `KeyError` when accessing an invalid key, fixing the bug.
