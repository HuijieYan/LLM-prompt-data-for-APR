### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class, which represents a one-dimensional array with axis labels.
2. The buggy function checks the type of the `key` argument and performs different actions based on its type.
3. The bug in the function seems to be related to handling the key argument when it is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`.
4. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a `Series` object with a key that is not present in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.
5. The bug occurs when trying to handle the key argument for different types, especially when it is a list or ndarray.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling the key argument that is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`. The current implementation does not correctly handle these types, leading to the KeyError when trying to index a `Series` object with a key that is not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to ensure that the key is correctly processed for different types: `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`.
2. Make sure to handle the case where the key is not present in the index to avoid the KeyError.
3. Consider the behavior of the `loc` and `iloc` methods when indexing using different types.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else self.reindex([key])
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else self.reindex([key])
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
I made changes to handle the case where the key is not found in the index. If the key is not found in the index, we default to using `reindex` with a list containing the key to avoid the KeyError. I also added a check for the key being present in the index before using `loc`. This ensures that the correct behavior is maintained when indexing a `Series` object with keys of different types.
