### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing the Series.
2. The bug is likely related to the handling of keys that are not recognized as list-like or specific types like `Index`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, etc.
3. The failing test is trying to index a Series using a key that doesn't exist in the Series index, expecting a KeyError.
4. The bug seems to be in the part where the function is checking for non-list-like keys. If the key is not recognized as a specific type, it falls back to trying to locate the key in the Series, which is incorrect.
5. It is important to handle non-list-like keys properly and handle the KeyError appropriately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the check for non-list-like keys to raise a KeyError instead of trying to locate the key in the Series.
2. The corrected version should explicitly handle the case where the key is not recognized as a specific type to provide a more informative error message.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key {key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above adjustments in the `_get_with` function, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
