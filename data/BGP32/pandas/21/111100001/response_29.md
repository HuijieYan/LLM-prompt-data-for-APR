### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. However, the bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or Series. The function fails to correctly index the Series object when the key input does not match any of the conditions it checks for.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional check `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))`, which incorrectly classifies numpy arrays, pandas Index objects, and pandas Series objects as non-list-like. This causes the function to incorrectly proceed to convert the key to a list in the subsequent condition blocks, leading to an incorrect indexing operation.

### Fix Strategy:
The fix involves modifying the condition that checks for the type of `key` input to account for numpy arrays, pandas Index, and pandas Series. Instead of checking if `key` is not a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, we should explicitly check for numpy arrays, pandas Index, and pandas Series separately. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the key is a pandas Index object separately before proceeding with the rest of the checks.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = "integer"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the explicit checks for numpy arrays, pandas Index, and pandas Series before proceeding to determine the key type and the subsequent indexing strategy based on the key input. This modification should resolve the bug and make the function handle different key types correctly.
