### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing the series. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key types, particularly when the key is a single item that is neither a list-like object nor an integer.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the key is not a list-like object or an integer. In that case, the function attempts to use the `key` directly to perform label-based indexing using `self.loc[key]`. However, if the `key` is not a list-like object, this operation will raise a `KeyError` because `key` needs to match an existing index value.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the `key` is not a list-like object or an integer. We can modify the condition to check for this scenario and avoid using `key` directly for label-based indexing. Instead, we can convert it to a list-like object (specifically a list) and then perform label-based indexing.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):  # Check if key is a scalar
        key = [key]  # Convert single scalar to a list
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):  # Check if key is a list
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the `_get_with` function will now correctly handle cases where the `key` is a single scalar value and convert it to a list before performing label-based indexing.
