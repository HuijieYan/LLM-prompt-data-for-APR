The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the way the input `key` is validated and processed. The bug causes a `KeyError` to be raised incorrectly when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index of the Series.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `key` is processed correctly based on its type and content. In particular, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, and correctly return the values corresponding to those keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
        if is_scalar(key):
            key = [key]
        
        key_type = lib.map_infer(key)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now correctly handle different types of `key` inputs and return the values corresponding to those keys from the Series.

This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing test case.
