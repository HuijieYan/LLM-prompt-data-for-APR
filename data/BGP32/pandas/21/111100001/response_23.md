### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs because in the `_get_with` function, when the key is converted to a list, the code is checking if the key is an instance of `Index` which results in incorrect behavior. This leads to the wrong method (`loc` instead of `reindex`) being called, causing the KeyError in the failing test.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following block of code:
```python
if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

if key_type == "integer":
    # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
    #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the key when it is an instance of `Index`. This results in choosing the wrong indexing method (`loc` instead of `reindex`) which leads to the KeyError in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct indexing method (`reindex`) is called when the key is not a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. We can achieve this by modifying the logic related to `Index` instances.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle the key properly and pass the failing test.
