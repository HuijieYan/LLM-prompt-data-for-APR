## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys passed to the `Series` for indexing. The issue arises when the key being passed is not found in the index, causing a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the current implementation of the function is not correctly handling this case, leading to the failing test.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the key being passed to `_get_with` is not found in the index of the `Series`. The function is not handling this scenario properly and does not provide a meaningful error message, leading to the failing test case where a `KeyError` is expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case where the key is not found in the index. We should check if the key is present in the index before proceeding with the indexing operation.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# This is the corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to verify if the key is present in the index before trying to access it, we ensure that a meaningful error message is raised when the key is not found. This correction should make the function pass the failing test and handle invalid key scenarios correctly.
