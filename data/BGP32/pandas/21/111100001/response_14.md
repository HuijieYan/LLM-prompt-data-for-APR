### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when the key is a scalar value and not recognized as list-like. In this case, it should be passed to the `loc` indexer, but the current implementation incorrectly uses `self.loc[key]` which raises a KeyError when the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by handling scalar values that are not recognized as list-like improperly. Instead of passing the scalar key to the `loc` indexer, it should have been directly returned as the key might be present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the code that handles scalar values. We should return the key directly when it is recognized as a scalar and not present in the index.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif lib.is_scalar(key):
            return key
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition to handle scalar values, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now handle scalar keys properly.
