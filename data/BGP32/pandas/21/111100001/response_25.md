### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key types and the subsequent indexing.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series using a key (`key`) that is not present in the Series index, leading to a KeyError.
4. The issue seems to be with how non-integer keys are handled, specifically in the part where the key type is inferred and then processed.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that proper handling of non-integer keys is done, especially in cases where the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is present in the Series index before attempting to index with it.
2. Handle non-integer keys correctly to avoid KeyError when the key is not in the index.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                if self.index.isin(key).all(): # Check if all elements in key are present in the index
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            if self.index.isin(key).all(): # Check if all elements in key are present in the index
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above update, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle non-integer keys more robustly and avoid KeyError when the key is not in the Series index.
