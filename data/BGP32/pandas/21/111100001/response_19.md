### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is used to retrieve values from a Series class object based on a given key. The key can be a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object. The bug seems to occur when the key is a list, numpy array, Index object, or Series object.

### Error:
The bug seems to occur when handling a list-like key input in the `_get_with(key)` function. The function incorrectly treats the key as a single value for indexing instead of iterating over the elements in the list.

### Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling list-like keys correctly in the `_get_with(key)` function. Instead of iterating over the elements in the list, it treats the entire list as a single value for indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the part of the code that handles the list-like key input. We should iterate over the elements in the list and process each element individually.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        result = []
        for k in key:  # Iterate over elements in the list-like input
            if is_scalar(k) and not is_bool(k):
                result.append(self.loc[k])
            else:
                result.append(self._get_with(k))
        return self.__class__(result)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle list-like keys by iterating over the elements and processing them individually. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as intended.
