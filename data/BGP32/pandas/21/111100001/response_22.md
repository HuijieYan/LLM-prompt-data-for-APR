### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is a method in the `Series` class.
- The function `_get_with(self, key)` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function processes keys that are not recognized as a list-like type.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existing key in the `Series`.
- The failure indicates that the function `_get_with(self, key)` is not handling the key correctly when it is not found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is likely triggered when a non-list-like key that is not recognized as a known type is passed to the `Series` object.
- The function tries to access `self.loc[key]` where `key` is the key that caused the failure when it was not found in the index.
- This leads to the `KeyError` exception, indicating that the key was not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to handle the case when a key is not found in the index properly to avoid raising a `KeyError`.
- We can modify the logic to account for cases where the key is not found in the index and handle it gracefully without causing an exception.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.reindex(key)  # Handle case where key is not list-like
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function handles the case where a key is not list-like properly by calling `self.reindex(key)`. This modification ensures that non-list-like keys that are not found in the index are handled gracefully without raising a `KeyError`.
