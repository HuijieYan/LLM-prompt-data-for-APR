After analyzing the buggy function `_get_with` and the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, we can identify the potential error location as the logic related to handling different types of keys within the function. The bug causes an inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

The cause of the bug:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle different types of indexers consistently. In the failing test, the key is converted to a list, and when trying to access the Series using this list key, a KeyError is raised. This behavior is not consistent with the handling of other types of indexers, leading to unexpected errors.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. We can modify the logic to treat all indexers in a uniform manner to avoid the KeyError inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, PDDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Treat all indexers uniformly
    if key_type in ('integer', 'string', 'boolean', 'mixed-integer'):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function now handles different types of indexers consistently and avoids the KeyError inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.

By executing the corrected code, the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` should now pass without raising a KeyError.
