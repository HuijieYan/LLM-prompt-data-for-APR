### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `_get_with` in pandas/core/series.py is responsible for handling various types of indexers and returning the appropriate values based on the type of the key passed. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py is testing the behavior when trying to access values in a Pandas Series using different types of indexers, specifically a list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The function incorrectly handles the case when a list indexer is provided, leading to a `KeyError` being raised.
2. The key_type determination is not functioning as expected, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

### Explaining the bug
The bug arises from the issue highlighted in the GitHub problem statement. When accessing a Pandas Series using a list indexer, the function fails to return the correct value and instead raises a `KeyError` stating that none of the provided keys are in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, leading to confusion and unexpected errors.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list indexers and returns the expected values when a list is provided as the key. This requires updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers and provide the correct output in line with the expectations set by the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in `_get_with` as shown above, the function now correctly handles list indexers and returns the expected values as per the failing test cases and the GitHub issue description. This corrected version should resolve the bug and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
