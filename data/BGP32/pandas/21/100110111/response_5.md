Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in how the function handles different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list-like indexer is passed, the function does not properly handle it and raises a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to correctly handle list-like indexers in a similar way as array-like or index-like indexers. The logic should be adjusted to ensure proper indexing handling for all types of input.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The updated function includes additional handling for list-like indexers. It converts the list-like key into an Index type using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers.

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle list-like indexers and pass the failing test cases provided. The corrections made align with the GitHub issue report mentioned.
