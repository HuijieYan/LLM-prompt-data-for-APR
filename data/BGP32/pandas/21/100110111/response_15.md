### Analysis
The function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there is a bug causing it to fail the test cases where the key is a list. The bug manifests when the key is passed as a list-type indexer, leading to a KeyError instead of the expected behavior.

### Identified Bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when a list-type indexer is passed. The function does not properly handle list indexers, resulting in a KeyError during the test execution.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is related to the way list-type indexers are processed within the function. When a list indexer is encountered, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the part of the function that handles list-type indexers to ensure proper processing and avoid the KeyError. Specifically, we need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation
In the corrected version of the function, we have specifically handled the case where the key is of type list. By checking if the key is an instance of list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, we ensure that list-type indexers are processed correctly. Additionally, we have adjusted the conditional statements to cover all necessary cases for proper indexing behavior.

### Re-running the Failing Test
After applying the corrections to the `_get_with` function, the failing test case should now pass without raising a KeyError.

### Note
Make sure to thoroughly test the corrected function with various input cases to ensure that it behaves as expected and resolves the bug as intended.
