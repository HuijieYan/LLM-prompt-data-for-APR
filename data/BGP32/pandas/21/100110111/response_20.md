### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and non-list-like scalars.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when a list-like object is used as a key to index a series. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but the function does not handle this case correctly.
3. The function is incorrectly reindexing the key when it is supposed to raise a `KeyError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a non-matching key is used to index the series, a `KeyError` is raised instead of reindexing the key.
5. The corrected function should handle the case of a non-matching key by raising a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function attempting to reindex the key when encountering a non-matching key value instead of raising a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected outcome when a non-matching key is used.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, modify the section of the code that handles the non-list-like key case to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function will now raise a `KeyError` when a non-matching key is used to index the series, consistent with the expected behavior.
