### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs and perform specific operations based on the input type. It seems to have an issue with handling list-like key inputs.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a KeyError to be raised when indexing a Series with a list-like key that has no matches in the index.
3. The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly processing list-like keys, leading to unexpected behavior and failing the test with a KeyError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys and raises a KeyError if no matches are found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly handle list-like keys and fails to raise a KeyError when there are no matches in the index. This results in unexpected behavior during indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code section that processes list-like keys to correctly handle cases where there are no matches in the index. We should ensure that the function raises a KeyError in such situations to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
In the corrected version of the function, the key handling for list-like inputs has been improved. We added a check to ensure that if none of the elements in the input key list are present in the index, a KeyError is raised. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases. Now, the function should properly handle list-like keys and raise a KeyError when needed, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
