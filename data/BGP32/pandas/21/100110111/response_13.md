### Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_get_with` contains an issue in the code block handling the `if not is_list_like(key)` condition. The issue arises from the incorrect assumption that `key` would not be a list in that case.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` to be raised when indexing a `Series` with a box containing no matching items. This issue is related to how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function.
3. The error message indicates that the `KeyError` exception was not raised as expected during the test execution.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the case where `key` is a list correctly and raises a `KeyError` when necessary.
5. The corrected version of the function should address the specific case where `key` is a list to align with the expected behavior in the failing test.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code block handling the `if not is_list_like(key)` condition to include the correct logic for handling cases where `key` is a list.
2. Ensure that the function raises a `KeyError` when indexing with a `box` containing no matching items, as indicated in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the above corrections into the `_get_with` function, it should now correctly handle the case where `key` is a list and raise a `KeyError` when necessary, fixing the bug and aligning the function with the expected behavior in the failing test.
