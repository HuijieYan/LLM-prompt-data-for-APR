### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of indexing a Series with an index that has no matches in the original Series.
3. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when using a list index.
4. The expected input/output values for the failing test involve passing a Series with a single value 'C' and indexing the Series 'ser' with it, expecting a KeyError.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, the function incorrectly falls back to calling `self.loc[key]` instead of raising a KeyError when no matches are found.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list indexer is passed, and there are no matches in the index, a KeyError is raised consistently with other indexers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_is_index = isinstance(key, Index)
    key_is_list = isinstance(key, list)
    key_type = key.inferred_type if key_is_index else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_is_list or key_is_index:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing this corrected version of the function, it should consistently handle list-like indexers and raise a KeyError when no matches are found in the index.
