### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing in a Series object. However, there is a bug in the code that leads to incorrect behavior when a list-like key is passed, resulting in a `KeyError` instead of returning a `NaN` value as expected.

The key issue arises when dealing with list-like keys, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue, stating that the treatment of list indexers differs from other array-like indexers.

The failing test case relates to testing the behavior of indexing with a list-like key and expecting a `KeyError` due to the issue in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the implementation of how list indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function. When a list key is provided, the function fails to properly handle it, leading to a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` values for non-existing indices.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys correctly. The correction should ensure consistency in the behavior of indexing regardless of the type of key provided.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to properly handle list-like keys and ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and align with the expected input/output values.
