### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalar values, lists, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check if an error is raised when trying to access elements that are not present in the Series.
3. The error occurs when using an index that is a list, which leads to different behavior compared to using other index types such as arrays or Index objects.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling different index types, specifically focusing on the `ser[key]` behavior when `key` is a list.
  
### Bug Cause:
When the `key` parameter in the failing test is a list, the current implementation does not handle it properly, leading to a KeyError being raised. This behavior contradicts the handling of other index types.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and align the behavior with different index types, we should modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently. This can involve modifying the condition checks and the return statements associated with list-like keys.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function as shown above, we handle list indexers consistently, ensuring that a KeyError is raised when elements are not found in the Series. This correction aligns the behavior with other index types and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
