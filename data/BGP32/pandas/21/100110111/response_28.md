### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to test how the function handles a key that does not match any existing index values.
3. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected when indexing with a list key.
4. The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of key inputs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of key inputs in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when indexing with a list key, the function fails to raise a `KeyError` as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of key inputs when indexing a Series. This involves updating the logic for handling the key input types to correctly raise a `KeyError` when the key does not match any existing index values.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any([isinstance(key, t) for t in [list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index]]):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing: {}".format(type(key)))

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # or label-based
        if not self.index.inferred_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError("None of {} are in the index".format(key))

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function ensures that when indexing with a list key that does not match any index values, a `KeyError` is raised consistently.
