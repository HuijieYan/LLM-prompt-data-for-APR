### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test
The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is aimed at testing the behavior of indexing with different types of keys such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

### Error in the buggy function
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when a key of type list is passed. The function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to index the Series.

### Cause of the bug
The issue arises because the function does not appropriately handle list-like keys, causing a mismatch in behavior compared to other types of keys. This inconsistency is highlighted by the failing test, showing that list-like keys do not produce the expected result.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of keys. By ensuring that list-like keys are processed correctly, the function can avoid raising `KeyError`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version above should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases with list, ndarray, Index, and Series keys. The function should now correctly index the Series without raising a `KeyError` for list-like keys.
