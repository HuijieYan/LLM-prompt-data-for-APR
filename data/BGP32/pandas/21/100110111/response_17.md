### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in pandas.core.series.py is not handling the case when the key is a list-like object correctly, leading to a KeyError exception during indexing.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py uses different data types such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series as keys to access a Series. However, when a list is used as a key, it results in a KeyError but should ideally behave consistently with other data types.
3. The expected behavior is that indexing with a list key should return NaN values for non-matching elements, similar to the behavior with other data types.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case when a list-like object is used as a key properly. This leads to a KeyError as the error message shows that the key elements are not found in the index, even though they should result in NaN values being returned.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like object is used as a key, the function should return NaN values for non-matching elements, similar to how it behaves with other data types like ndarray, Index, and Series.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_arr = np.asarray(key)

    if not isinstance(key_arr, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_arr = list(key)

    if isinstance(key_arr, Index):
        key_type = key_arr.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_arr, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key_arr]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key_arr]

    if isinstance(key_arr, list):
        return self.loc[key_arr]

    return self.reindex(key_arr)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, it will correctly handle list-like keys and return NaN values for non-matching elements, satisfying the expected behavior and resolving the GitHub issue related to inconsistent indexing behavior.
