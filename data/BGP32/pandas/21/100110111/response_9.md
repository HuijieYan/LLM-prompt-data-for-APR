### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, the bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and expects a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.
3. The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the Series indexing operation, leading to an inconsistency in error handling compared to other types of keys.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers and suggests aligning the behaviors to improve consistency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in how list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is passed, it tries to index directly with `self.loc[key]`, leading to a `KeyError` instead of reindexing for a consistent error message.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are treated consistently with other array-like keys. The key error message should be raised when the key is not found in the index, maintaining consistency across different types of keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index.__class__.__name__}")
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the inconsistency in handling list keys should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test while maintaining consistent behavior across different key types.
