### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is supposed to handle different types of input `key`, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and various data structures. The bug seems to occur when dealing with list-like keys.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file tries to access a Series using a list-like key and expects a `KeyError`.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle list keys correctly and raises a `KeyError` even though the key is present in the index.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition for list-like keys to handle them correctly.
5. The corrected version of the function should properly handle list-like keys and return the expected output without raising `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling list-like keys correctly. When the key is a list, even though it is present in the index, the function incorrectly raises a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that when the key is a list, the function retrieves the values corresponding to those keys from the Series without raising a `KeyError`.

### The Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function to explicitly check if each key is present in the index before accessing it, we ensure that the function retrieves values for list keys without raising a `KeyError`. This correction addresses the bug and aligns the behavior with the expectations outlined in the failing test.
