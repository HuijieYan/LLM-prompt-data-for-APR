### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input key for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is aimed at testing the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of key variables like list, numpy array, Index, and Series.
3. The error message indicates that the test did not raise a KeyError as expected when indexing with a list.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexing with a list input key, causing inconsistency with other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused due to inconsistency in how the function handles list indexers compared to other types of indexers like numpy arrays, Index, or Series. This inconsistency leads to incorrect behavior when trying to index a Series with a list key.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers. Specifically, the function should handle list indexers similar to the way it handles numpy arrays, Index, or Series indexers to maintain uniform behavior and avoid the KeyError issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, Index):  # Handle duplicate Index case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments mentioned above, the corrected function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
