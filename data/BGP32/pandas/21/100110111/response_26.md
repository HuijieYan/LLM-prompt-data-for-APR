### Analyzing the buggy function and failing tests

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, the bug arises when passing a list as an indexer. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior of the function when using different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series).

The error message from the failing test indicates that `ser[key]` did not raise a `KeyError` as expected. This inconsistency in behavior occurs when a list indexer is passed.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like indexers in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block. It should correctly handle the case when a list is provided as an indexer.

### Explanation of the bug

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle list-like indexers. When a list indexer is passed, the function falls into the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block. In this block, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, but this approach is incorrect when dealing with list indexers. This results in the function not raising a `KeyError` as expected in the failing test.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers appropriately. Instead of trying to access `self.loc[key]`, it should raise a `KeyError` when none of the elements in the list-like indexer are found in the Series index.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_index = [idx for idx in key if idx in self.index]
        if not key_index:  # No matches found
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key_index]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Proposed changes in the corrected version

1. Check if the indexer is a list and then find the matching elements in the Series index.
2. If no matches are found, raise a `KeyError`.
3. Return the result based on the updated approach for handling list-like indexers.

By making these changes, the corrected function should handle list-like indexers correctly and pass the failing test case.
