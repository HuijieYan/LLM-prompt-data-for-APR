## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used for indexing a Series object but fails to handle certain types of indexers correctly.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to access a value from the Series using an index key that does not exist in the Series, expecting a KeyError to be raised. However, the buggy function does not handle this scenario properly.
3. The bug arises due to the inconsistent behavior of the `_get_with` function when the key is of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function fails to raise a KeyError when a key that does not exist in the Series is used for indexing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a KeyError is raised when trying to access values using an index key that does not exist in the Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add appropriate checks within the `_get_with` function to ensure that if the key is an indexer that does not exist in the Series, a KeyError is raised.
2. Handle the cases of list, ndarray, Index, and Series key types correctly by verifying if the elements exist in the Series before returning values.
3. Ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        keys_not_in_series = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
        if keys_not_in_series:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {keys_not_in_series} are in the index")

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing these changes in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version now correctly handles different types of indexers, especially when the key that does not exist in the Series is used. This fix ensures that a KeyError is raised in such scenarios, resolving the bug.
