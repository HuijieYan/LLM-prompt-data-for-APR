## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of indexers when indexing a Series. However, the issue arises when a list indexer is passed because the behavior differs from array-like indexers such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. This inconsistency causes a KeyError to be raised for list indexers, unlike other types.

## Identified Potential Error Location:
The bug occurs when dealing with a list indexer in the `_get_with` function, specifically this portion of the code: 
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    return self.loc[key]
```

## Cause of the Bug:
When a list key is passed to the buggy function, it doesn't branch out properly to handle list-like objects. This leads to treating a list indexer differently from array-like types, which results in a KeyError being raised inconsistently.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. By identifying the key as a list and handling it appropriately, we can maintain consistency in Series indexing behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the handling of list-like key types within the `_get_with` function, we should now be able to handle list indexers consistently with array-like indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. This corrected version should pass the failing test related to the issue posted on GitHub and maintain consistent behavior across different indexer types.
