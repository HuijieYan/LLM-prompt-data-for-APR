### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library handles different types of key inputs such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when using different types of keys with a Series.
3. The error message `KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"` indicates an issue with how keys are handled in the `_get_with(key)` function.
4. The GitHub issue describes the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series and suggests aligning the behavior to be consistent.

### Potential error location in the buggy function:
The bug might be related to how different types of keys are handled in the `_get_with(key)` function, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Cause of the bug:
1. When a list-like key is passed to `ser[key]`, it fails to handle the key appropriately.
2. The buggy function doesn't consider the case where a list key is passed and results in the `KeyError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with(key)` function to address the inconsistency observed when using different indexers with a Series.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if isinstance(key, list) and all(is_bool(k) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the handling of lists as keys in the `_get_with(key)` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
