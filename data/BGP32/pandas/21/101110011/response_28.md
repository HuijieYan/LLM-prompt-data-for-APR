After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can see that the issue arises when using a list as an indexer, where the behavior is inconsistent with other types such as arrays or indexes. This inconsistency causes a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access an item that doesn't exist in the Series.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of using a list as an indexer aligns with that of arrays and indexes. This can be achieved by modifying the logic inside the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):

    # Fix the buggy function
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # Similar to existing logic
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.iloc[key]  # Changed to iloc from loc
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By changing the return statement for list indexers to use `iloc` instead of `loc`, we ensure that the behavior is consistent for various types of indexers. This change aligns with the existing behavior of arrays and indexes, resolving the inconsistency and addressing the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle list indexers in a Series, passing the failing tests and resolving the reported issue on GitHub.
