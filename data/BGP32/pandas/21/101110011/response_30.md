## Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling various types of indexers and returning the corresponding values from the series. The issue arises when using a list-like indexer, such as a list, numpy array, or pandas series, that contains no matching values in the series.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file highlights the problem. When trying to access values using an indexer that has no matches in the series, the error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected.

## Identify potential error locations

The bug occurs when handling a list-like indexer that does not contain any match in the series. The buggy function tries to return values from the series based on the indexer but fails to raise a KeyError when no matching values are found.

## Error Cause

The bug leads to inconsistent behavior depending on the type of list-like indexer used. The behavior is not consistent between a list indexer, an array-like indexer, and a pandas series indexer when no matches are found in the series.

The cause of the bug is related to how the `_get_with` function handles different types of indexers, specifically when no matching values are present in the series. The function does not respond consistently to this scenario.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

To address the bug effectively, we need to modify the logic within the `_get_with` function to ensure that when a list-like indexer contains no matching values in the series, a KeyError is raised consistently regardless of the type of indexer used. By improving the error handling in these scenarios, we can achieve consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Check if no matching values are found
    if len(self.loc[key]) == 0:
        raise KeyError(f"No matching values found for indexer: {key}")
    
    # Handle valid indexers
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to verify if no matching values are found for the indexer `key`. If no matches are found, a KeyError is raised with a descriptive message. This modification ensures consistent behavior when handling list-like indexers that contain no matches in the series, resolving the bug identified in the failing test.

Please implement this correction in the `pandas/core/series.py` file and test it against the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` to verify that the bug has been successfully fixed.
