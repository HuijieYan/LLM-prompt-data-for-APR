## Analysis:
The `buggy _get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys to perform indexing. However, it fails in scenarios where the key is a list-like object such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to show that the behavior is inconsistent with different types of key objects, and in particular, the list-like objects lead to a KeyError.

The key error occurs due to inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other indexers in the `_get_with` function. Additionally, a related GitHub issue `API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]` highlights this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior of list-like indexers with other indexers.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to different handling for list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers. When the key is a list, the function does not correctly handle the indexing operation, leading to a KeyError as observed in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should align the behavior for list-like indexers with how other indexers are processed to avoid the KeyError. By updating the logic to properly handle list-like indexers, we can resolve the issue and make the function work as expected.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other indexers, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub ticket.
