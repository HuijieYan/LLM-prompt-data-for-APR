### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling different types of indexers including slices, `tuple`, `list`, `numpy.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, and `Index`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is focused on testing the behavior of passing a key that does not exist in the index.
3. The error message indicates that the `KeyError` exception was not raised when accessing a non-existent key using different types of indexers.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to access non-existent keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the check for `list` indexers is causing the issue as it does not raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index, unlike other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. We should modify the code in the `_get_with` function to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index, regardless of the type of indexer used.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except (KeyError, IndexError):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

```

### Summary:
By updating the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently by raising a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index, we can ensure the correct behavior across different indexer types. This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and make the function more robust in handling index lookup failures.
