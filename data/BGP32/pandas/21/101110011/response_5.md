### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of keys for indexing. The bug seems to arise when a list-like key is provided.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing with keys that have no matches in the `Series`.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed to raise a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like key.
4. The provided GitHub issue highlights inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of key types within the `_get_with` function, specifically when dealing with list-like keys.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers to match the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the inconsistent behavior related to list-like keys should be resolved, and the failing test should pass as expected.
