## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` is used for indexing a `Series` object with various types of input keys.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of indexing a `Series` object with different types of keys, like lists, NumPy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when using a list key, which is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of keys.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in Pandas, specifically mentioning the discrepancy with respect to handling a `KeyError`.
5. The bug seems to originate from the logic within the `_get_with` function concerning how different key types are processed.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when processing list-like keys. The function fails to correctly handle the case where a key is a list, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised as expected in the failing test. This inconsistency in handling different key types causes the bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure list-like keys are processed correctly. This involves aligning the behavior for list keys with that of other types of keys like NumPy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. By addressing the conditional checks and key processing steps involving list-like keys, we can resolve the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test.

## The Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected logic for handling list-like keys, the bug causing the `KeyError` issue in the failing test should be resolved.
