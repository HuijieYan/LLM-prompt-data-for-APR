Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, we can see that the issue lies in the handling of different types of index keys. Specifically, when the key is a list type, the function is trying to handle it differently than other array-like key types, which is causing inconsistency in behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to test the behavior when indexing with a list-like key that has no matches in the Series index. However, the function `_get_with` is not handling this case correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` not being raised as expected.

To fix this bug, we should modify the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function to match the behavior of other array-like keys. By treating all indexers uniformly, we can ensure consistent behavior and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        if isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            key = ensure_index(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that all index-like objects are converted to an Index object before processing and applying consistent logic for different key types, we have addressed the issue with list-like keys not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency reported on GitHub.
