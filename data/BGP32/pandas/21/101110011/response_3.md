## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `test_getitem.py` is checking the behavior when trying to access values in a Series using an index (key) that does not match any values in the Series.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected error (KeyError) was not raised when indexing with a key that doesn't exist in the Series.
4. The GitHub issue provides additional context on how different indexers are handled inconsistently, specifically pointing out the case of a list indexer causing an error message that is not raised in other cases.

## Error Cause:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is provided, an error should be raised if none of the items in the list match the Series index. However, the function currently does not raise the KeyError as expected in this scenario.

## Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that when a list indexer is passed, a KeyError should be raised if none of the items in the list match the Series index.
2. Adjust the conditional blocks to handle list indexers properly and raise a KeyError in case of no matching values.
3. Update the `_get_with` function to align with the consistency required for different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # handle the case where none of the items in the list match the index
        if not any(val in self.index for val in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function as shown above, the corrected version now properly handles the case of a list indexer where none of the items match the Series index, ensuring consistent behavior with other indexers. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test scenario.
