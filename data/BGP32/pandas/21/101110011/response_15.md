### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when a key with no matches is used for indexing.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not raised as expected when using certain types of keys for indexing.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation of `_get_with` is not handling the case of using a list as an indexer correctly, leading to inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the logic inside the `_get_with` function to ensure that all types of indexers (including lists) are handled consistently.
2. Make adjustments to the conditional statements to correctly identify and handle different types of indexers.
3. Ensure that the KeyError is raised when necessary, particularly when using a list as an indexer.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `elif` statement to check for `list` as a type of `key` and then handling it similarly to other types of indexers, the fixed function should now handle this case correctly. This correction ensures consistent behavior across various types of indexers and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
