## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is responsible for handling different types of keys to access values in the Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` provides a key that is being converted to a list but then raises a `KeyError` when used to access the Series.
3. The error message indicates that the key provided is not found in the index of the Series, which should result in a `KeyError` being raised.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers versus other indexers like arrays or Index objects.
5. The bug is occurring due to a mismatch in handling list-like keys within the `_get_with` function, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to access the Series data.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Since the failing test provides a key that is not present in the Series index, the bug fix should focus on correctly handling list-like keys to avoid the `KeyError`.
2. The correction involves updating the logic for handling list-like keys within the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
3. The fix should align the handling of list-like keys with the behavior observed when using other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects.
4. By identifying the error in handling list-like keys and aligning it with the expected behavior, the bug can be fixed to pass the failing test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to raise a `KeyError` directly when the key is not found in the index, the bug can be fixed to pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
