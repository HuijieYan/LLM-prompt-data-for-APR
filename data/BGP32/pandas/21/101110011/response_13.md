### Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and understanding the issue from the related test function and GitHub issue, it seems that the problem lies in how the `key` input is handled when it's an array-like object such as a list, NumPy array, Index, or Series. The current implementation fails to handle these array-like indexers correctly.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure that all array-like indexers are handled consistently and that the appropriate validation and indexing mechanisms are applied.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        # Propagate boolean indexing to __getitem__ for consistent handling
        return self.__getitem__(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Use iloc if possible, otherwise fall back to loc
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handling array-like indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # Converting to list for consistent behavior
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should handle the array-like indexers consistently, which will resolve the failing test case mentioned. This fix aligns with the discussion in the GitHub issue and aims to maintain a uniform approach to handling indexers across different types of inputs.
