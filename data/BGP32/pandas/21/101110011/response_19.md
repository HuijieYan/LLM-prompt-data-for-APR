## Analyzing the buggy function and related information

1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of the `pandas/core/series.py` file is causing the test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file to fail.
2. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and based on its type, performs certain operations.
3. The failure is occurring when the `key` parameter is of type `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, `list`, or `np.array`.
4. The error message from the failing test indicates a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected when using the `list` type as the `key`.
5. The GitHub issue mentioned describes inconsistencies in behavior when indexing with different types (list, array, Index, Series).

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The issue might be occurring when handling the `key` parameter of type `list`.

## Explanation of the bug
1. The `_get_with(self, key)` function is not behaving consistently when processing indexers of different types. The problem occurs when `key` is of type `list`, which is causing a `KeyError` to not be raised when expected.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Modify the section of the function related to handling `list` type indexers to match the behavior with other types like `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`.
2. Ensure that a `KeyError` is properly raised for all cases when the key is not found in the index.
3. Update the logic to handle the `list` type of indexers correctly to resolve the inconsistency issue.

## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In the corrected version, the function now ensures that a `KeyError` is properly raised for all cases when the key is not found in the index, including when the `key` parameter is of type `list`. This modification aligns the behavior of handling different types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
