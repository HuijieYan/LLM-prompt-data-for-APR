### Analysis:
1. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test is failing due to inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list type indexer is used, a KeyError is raised, while for other types like an ndarray, Index, or Series, no KeyError is raised.
2. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for this issue, as it does not handle list-like indexers correctly.
3. The corresponding error message indicates that the behavior for list indexers is not consistent with other types of indexers.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers.

### Suggested Fix:
Modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like indexers to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Ensure list-like indexers are handled consistently
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test case.
