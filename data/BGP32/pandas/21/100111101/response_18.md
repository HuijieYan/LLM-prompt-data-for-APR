### Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The error in this function seems to be related to the handling of the input key types, specifically when the key type is a list or ndarray.

From the failing test scenarios and runtime values, it is apparent that when the `key` variable is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the function encounters issues. In these cases, the function incorrectly sets the `key_type` as `'integer'` or `'string'`, which leads to incorrect behavior during indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when dealing with list-like objects as keys to ensure proper indexing behavior for the Series object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of the `key` input parameter and handle different types appropriately.
2. Ensure that when the `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the function handles it correctly based on the actual values within the key.
3. Make sure to reevaluate the key type determination logic to address issues related to incorrect indexing behavior.

### The Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Index):
        # Handling list, ndarray, or Index keys
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `key` type checks and how they are handled in the function, we can ensure that the correct indexing behavior is maintained for all types of input keys.
