The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of `key` inputs. In the failing test, the key input is being converted to a different type while performing an indexing operation, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix this issue, we need to make the `_get_with` function more robust in handling different types of inputs for `key`, ensuring that the input type conversion does not cause unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_dict_like(key):
        return self._get_with(key.values)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We first check if the `key` is a slice and handle it accordingly.
- Then, we check if the `key` is a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index and directly perform the indexing operation using `loc`.
- If the `key` is dict-like, we call the function recursively with the values of the dictionary.
- Finally, for any other type of `key`, we return the result of a reindex operation on the `key`.

This updated function should now correctly handle different types of `key` inputs and pass the failing tests.
