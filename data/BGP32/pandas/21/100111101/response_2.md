## Bug analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to arise from incorrect handling of the key type `'string'` in the function. The function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'` instead of `'object'` in the failing test cases.

In the failing test case, the key value is indeed an object type (`dtype='object'`), but the function misidentifies it as a `'string'`. This incorrect identification leads to a failure due to a KeyError when trying to index the Series with the key.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure proper identification of the key type. Specifically, we should update the logic to correctly determine the key type as `'object'` when dealing with object-type keys. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring in the failing test cases.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Correct the key type as 'object' for object-type keys
    if key_type == "string":
        key_type = "object"

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to correctly determine the key type and addressing the issue of misclassification for object-type keys, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases and work as expected.
