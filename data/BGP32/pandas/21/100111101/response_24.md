The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of non-list-like keys, which causes the KeyError to not be raised as expected in the test cases. The issue lies in the conditional branches that check for specific types of the key parameter.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that non-list-like keys are correctly handled and raise a KeyError when necessary. We can achieve this by modifying the conditional branches to account for all possible non-list-like key types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with non-compatible data types is not supported."
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This modified version ensures that keys of non-list-like types will raise a TypeError, and scalars are specifically handled using `is_scalar()`. Additionally, the key is converted to an index using `ensure_index()` to handle various input types.

This correction should now pass all the failing test cases by properly handling different types of keys in the `_get_with` function.
