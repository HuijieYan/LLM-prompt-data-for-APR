The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic to handle the input key. The function is not correctly identifying the key type and handling it appropriately, leading to the KeyError in the test cases.

The key issue is when dealing with non-list-like inputs and incorrectly inferring the key type as `'string'`. This leads to an incorrect branch being executed in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to address how different types of keys are handled in the function to match the expected behavior in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle different key types appropriately and pass the failing tests by returning the expected values based on the input keys provided.
