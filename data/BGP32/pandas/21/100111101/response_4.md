## Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series that contains values not present in the Series index. The function attempts to handle these cases but fails to raise a `KeyError` when the values are not found in the index, causing the tests to fail.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of the keys that are not present in the Series index. The function does not correctly identify that the key is not present in the index and does not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `key` values are in the Series index.
2. If any of the `key` values are not present in the index, raise a `KeyError`.
3. This behavior should be consistent for all types of keys - list, ndarray, Index, and Series.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function will correctly check if any values in the `key` are not present in the Series index and raise a `KeyError` in those cases. This fix should now pass the failing tests and handle the cases where the key values are not found in the Series index.
