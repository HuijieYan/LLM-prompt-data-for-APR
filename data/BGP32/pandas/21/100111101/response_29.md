### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` provides a key that is not present in the Series index, expecting a KeyError to be raised.
3. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'` instead of `'object'`, leading to the wrong behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly determined and handled accordingly.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect identification of the key type, leading to a KeyError instead of handling the case where the key is not in the index.

### Fix:
Modify the code to correctly determine the key type by using the `lib.infer_dtype` function and handle the key types appropriately.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label based
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After implementing this fix, the corrected function should now correctly identify the key type and handle the indexing operation accordingly, passing the failing test cases.
