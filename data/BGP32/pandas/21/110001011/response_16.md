### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class within the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling various types of keys to acquire values from the Series object.
2. The function checks the type of `key` and based on the type, it branches into different conditions to fetch the values.
3. The bug seems to occur when `not is_list_like(key)` check is performed, leading to an incorrect path of execution.
4. The bug affects cases where the key is a single value, causing it to incorrectly produce results.
5. The GitHub issue highlights inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers, resulting in unexpected behavior and KeyErrors in certain scenarios.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because when the key is a single value (not list-like), it tries to access the value directly as `self.loc[key]`. This method call may be invalid, resulting in erroneous outputs.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that single values keys are handled correctly by identifying them as scalar values and returning the appropriate result. By checking and processing single keys separately, we can address the inconsistency issue highlighted in the GitHub thread.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle scalar values
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the function now properly handles scalar keys by directly accessing `self.loc[key]` when the key is a single value. It ensures that all types of keys are processed correctly and consistently, addressing the bug and the reported inconsistency in how list indexers are treated.
