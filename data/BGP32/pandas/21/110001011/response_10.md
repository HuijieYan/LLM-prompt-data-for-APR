### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for a `Series` object. Based on the runtimes provided, it seems that the issue lies in the block of code trying to determine the type of the key based on various conditions. The problem appears to be with the type checking and decision-making logic for different key types.

### Error Location:
The error likely stems from the `key_type` determination logic and the subsequent branching based on that. The issue arises when the key is converted to a list type and then the type inference is done, potentially leading to incorrect decision making based on the inferred type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of key types (especially when converting to list) which results in inaccurate type inference and decision making, leading to the wrong selection between positional and label-based indexing.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for determining the key type to be more accurate.
2. Ensure that conversions to list type do not interfere with the type inference process.
3. Improve the decision-making process based on the correct key type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure the key is converted to `Index` type before determining its type using `lib.infer_dtype`. We handle integer and boolean types separately for correct decision making between label-based and positional indexing. The modifications aim to address the key type inference issue and ensure the appropriate indexing method is used based on the key type.
