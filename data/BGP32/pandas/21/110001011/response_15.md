The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue where it incorrectly handles different types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies in behavior. The problem arises when dealing with different types of indexer objects like lists, arrays, or single values.

### Potential error locations:
1. In the case where `key` is not recognized as an instance of a list-like object, it tries to call `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The handling of different types of `key` objects may not be consistent, causing issues like the ones described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, especially when a list indexer is used, causing unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in accessing the data in the `Series`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` correctly handles the different types of indexers to provide a consistent and expected behavior for accessing the data in the `Series`.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):  # Check if it's a single value
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that the function correctly handles different types of indexers like lists, arrays, single values, etc., we can provide consistent behavior when accessing the data in the `Series`. This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure more reliable functionality.
