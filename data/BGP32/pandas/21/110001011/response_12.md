### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers to retrieve values from a Series object.
2. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different actions based on its type, such as handling slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other indexers.
3. The bug arises when `key` is a list-like object. The function fails to handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect type inference (`key_type`) and returning the wrong result.
4. The bug is related to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
When `key` is a list-like object, the buggy function wrongly assumes `key` to be an index or a series, leading to incorrect processing and inference of `key_type`. This leads to returning the wrong result due to incorrect conditional branches.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling list-like objects correctly. We should properly identify list-like objects and handle them appropriately based on their type to ensure the correct inference of `key_type` and return the expected result.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Update for list-like objects
        if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, ExtensionArray)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            elif key_type == "boolean":
                # Handle boolean type key
                raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        else:
            # Handle unrecognized keys
            raise KeyError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version now properly handles list-like objects, infers the correct key type, and returns the expected result. It addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior discussed in the GitHub issue.
