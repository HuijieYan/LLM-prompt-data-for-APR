## Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, and lists. The bug seems to arise when the input `key` is a list. The function checks if `key` is a list and then proceeds to handle it accordingly based on its type, which leads to incorrect behavior.

## Error Location
The issue stems from the section where the function checks if `key` is a list, converts it to `list(key)`, and then further processing continues. This conversion to a list might not be appropriate for all cases, leading to unexpected outcomes.

## Bug Cause
Based on the runtime values provided, when the function encounters a `key` which is a list, it converts it to a list again which might not be needed. This unnecessary conversion can result in an incorrect `key_type` detection and subsequently wrong indexing decisions.

## Strategy for Fixing
To address the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is already a list differently from when it is a different type. This can help avoid unnecessary conversions and ensure correct indexing based on the actual type of `key`.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = [key]
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we remove the unnecessary list conversion by handling the case more explicitly when `key` is already a list. This change ensures that the `key_type` is inferred correctly and the indexing decisions are made based on the actual type of `key`.
