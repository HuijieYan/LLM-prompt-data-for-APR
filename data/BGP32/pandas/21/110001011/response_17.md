### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, etc. The bug seems to be occurring in the logic related to handling list-like objects as indexers.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be arising in the section where the code tries to distinguish between different types of indexers and determine how to handle them. Specifically, the problem lies in the handling of list-like objects.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current implementation does not properly handle list-like objects as indexers. When a list-like object is passed as an indexer, the code fails to correctly identify it and leads to a misinterpretation of the type of key being used.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to distinguish list-like objects more accurately.
2. Ensure that the correct operations are applied based on the type of key being used as an indexer.

### Corrected Version: Bug Fix for handling list-like objects as indexers
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Correct the logic for handling list-like objects
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle the case of reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # Handle scalars or unrecognized objects
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version adjusts the logic to properly handle list-like objects as indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. It distinguishes between different types of indexers and applies the appropriate operations based on the type of key being used.
