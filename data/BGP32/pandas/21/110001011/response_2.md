### Analysis:
1. The `buggy function` `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key input for indexing a `Series`.
2. The function checks for the type of the key and performs different operations based on that type.
3. The bug seems to occur when dealing with a non-list-like key input, where the function incorrectly tries to access the `loc` attribute of the Series with the key directly, leading to errors.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a list that contains no matches.
5. The issue seems to be related to the handling of different types of indexers and error handling in the `Series` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when a non-list-like key is provided, the function tries to directly access the 'loc' attribute of the Series with the key, assuming it's a valid index. This leads to errors, especially when the key does not exist in the Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle non-list-like keys differently and avoid directly accessing the 'loc' attribute of the Series with such keys. Instead, we should apply proper error handling to address situations where the key may not exist in the Series.

### Code Fix:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)

    # For other types of keys
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding proper error handling for non-list-like keys and specifically handling cases where the key may not exist in the Series, we can address the bug and provide more consistent behavior when indexing `Series` objects.
