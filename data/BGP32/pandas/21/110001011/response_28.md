## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The function checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object, and branches out to different logic accordingly.
3. The bug seems to be related to how different types of keys are handled, leading to incorrect results for certain cases.
4. Cases provided show that for string keys (like `'C'`), the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all scenarios.
5. This bug could be the reason why the indexing is not working as expected for string keys.

## Bug Cause
The bug seems to stem from how the function is identifying the `key_type`. It incorrectly labels all keys as `'string'` regardless of their actual type. This misclassification is likely affecting the selection logic within the function, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, focus on identifying the actual type of the key correctly to ensure the function branches to the appropriate indexing logic. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of the key provided, ensuring that it matches the expected behavior for different key types.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I've updated the logic for determining the `key_type` based on different conditions, especially focusing on correctly identifying integer keys for positional indexing. This should address the bug and align the indexing behavior with the expected results.
