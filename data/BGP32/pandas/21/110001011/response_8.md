### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers (`key`) and returning the corresponding values.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of indexers that are passed as a list. The expected behavior is not met for list-like indexers compared to other types.
3. The key issue is how list-like indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers like slices or tuples. The `key_type` is inferred incorrectly as "integer," causing the function to behave incorrectly for list-like indexers.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly identify the type of the `key` and handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the `key` input in a way that properly distinguishes list-like indexers from other types.
2. Update the conditional statements to ensure that proper actions are taken based on the type of the `key`.
3. Handle list-like indexers consistently with other types to maintain correct behavior across different indexer types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle list-like indexers and continuing to use the same logic for them as for other types, the bug should be addressed. This corrected version should provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers in the `Series` class.
