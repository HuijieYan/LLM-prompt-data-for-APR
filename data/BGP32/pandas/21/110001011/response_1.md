Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function revolves around handling different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with a list-like indexer. The issue stems from the inconsistent behavior in how different types of indexers are treated, leading to unexpected errors. 

Here's a breakdown of the identified issues:
1. The function does not correctly handle the case when `key` is a list, resulting in an error when trying to access `self.loc[key]`.
2. The function fails to properly distinguish between different types of indexers, leading to incorrect processing of the input key.

To fix the bug, we need to update how the function handles list-like indexers and improve the logic for identifying the type of key being passed. We should ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers to avoid unexpected errors.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the identified issues:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Ensure key is in a list format
    
    if is_scalar(key) or (is_list_like(key) and len(key) == 1):
        return self.loc[key[0]]  # Handle scalar or single element list index
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The updated function properly handles the case when `key` is a list or a scalar value, ensuring that the indexing behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. By incorporating these changes, we aim to resolve the inconsistency issues outlined in the GitHub bug report.
