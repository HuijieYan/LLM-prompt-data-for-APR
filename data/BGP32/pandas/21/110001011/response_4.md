### Analysis:
1. The `__getitem__` method in `pandas.core.series` is supposed to handle different types of input keys, including slices, dataframes, tuples, and various sequence types.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers with Series objects.
3. The bug seems to be related to determining the key type and correctly handling the indexing based on the inferred key type. The issue arises when dealing with single-element list indexers.
4. The current implementation is not handling the list indexers in the same way as other types of arrays or indices, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Bug:
The bug arises from handling list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing incorrect behavior and leading to KeyError exceptions.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers for better alignment with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list indexers
    if isinstance(key, list) and len(key) == 1:
        return self.loc[key[0]]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles single-element list indexers by extracting the single value from the list before indexing the Series. This ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and aligns with the expected functionality.
