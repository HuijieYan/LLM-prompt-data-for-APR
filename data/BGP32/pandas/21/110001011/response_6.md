### Analysis:
1. The `self.index` is a `RangeIndex` and the `key` is being checked for various types like `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, non-list-like objects, and different types of arrays or indexes.
2. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the key type determination where it results in `'string'` type which is not expected in this context.
3. The bug leads to incorrect indexing behavior and inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect determination of the key type, resulting in `'string'` type in various scenarios, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and inconsistency with list indexers as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, ensure that the key type determination is correctly handling the different types of key inputs, especially when dealing with non-list-like objects. A more robust approach is needed to correctly identify the key type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            key_type = "integer"  # Check if key is an ndarray
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a more precise determination of the key type, specifically addressing the scenarios where the type inference could be incorrect. This should fix the bug and ensure consistent indexing behavior across different types of key inputs.
