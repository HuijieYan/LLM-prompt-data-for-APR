### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys and deciding whether to operate behavior like `iloc` or `loc`.
2. The function checks if the key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list-like, or other types like Series, Index, etc.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys and deciding the appropriate action based on the type.
4. The GitHub issue highlights a specific inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and KeyError.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list (in Cases 1, 2, and 4), it should be treated similar to other array-like indexers to maintain consistency. The current implementation fails to handle list keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. This involves updating the logic to correctly interpret and process list keys in a similar manner to other acceptable key types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I removed the redundant check for non-list-like key types and updated the logic to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. This fix aligns the behavior of list indexers with the expected functionality and resolves the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
