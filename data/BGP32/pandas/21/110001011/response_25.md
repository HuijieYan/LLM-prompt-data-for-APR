### Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of key inputs like slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc. However, there is a bug in the implementation related to the handling of list-like keys. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list compared to other types like slices or dataframes.

### Error Location
The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where different types of key inputs are being processed, specifically when dealing with list-like keys.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by improper handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function does not treat list-like keys consistently with other types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of keys throughout the function. This might involve adjusting the logic for processing list-like keys to align with the behavior expected for indexing in a `Series`.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, list-like keys are treated consistently with other types of keys, ensuring that the behavior is uniform and follows the expected indexing logic in a `Series`.
