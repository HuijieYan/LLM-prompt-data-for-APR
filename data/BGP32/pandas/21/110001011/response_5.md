### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is used for indexing operations in a `Series` object.
2. The function checks the type of the input `key` parameter and performs different actions based on the type.
3. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`) are handled, causing inconsistencies in behavior.
4. The key issue is that the function is not handling the input types consistently, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`). This inconsistency leads to errors in certain cases, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers. The desired behavior should align with the expectations set by the users and maintain consistency across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated handling of different key types
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, Index):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle different types of indexers consistently and according to user expectations, the bug can be fixed, resolving the inconsistency in behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.
