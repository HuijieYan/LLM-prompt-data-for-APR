### Analysis:
- The `_get_with` function is responsible for handling different types of key inputs to access elements within a Series.
- The function checks the type of the key and takes different actions based on the type.
- The bug seems to be related to how different types of keys are handled, especially when the key is a list.
- The issue on GitHub suggests that the behavior is inconsistent when using a list key compared to other types of keys.
- The function is supposed to return the key type and decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing based on the key type.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of keys when they are of different types (list, tuple, ndarray, Index, etc.).
2. Determining the key type and deciding whether to use `.loc` or `.iloc`.
3. Reindexing when the key type is not any of the predefined types.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because when the key is a list, it is not handled correctly leading to unexpected behavior and potentially incorrect results. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue.
- The function does not properly handle list-like keys when determining the key type and the subsequent indexing method to use.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Ensure that list keys are handled consistently with other types of keys.
- Properly determine the key type and apply the appropriate indexing method (`.loc` or `.iloc`).
- Make adjustments to cover cases where the key is list-like and avoid errors during indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently and the key type is properly determined to use the correct indexing method. The fix addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and provides a more reliable behavior when accessing elements within the Series.
