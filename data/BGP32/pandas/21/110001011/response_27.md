### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list likes, lists, etc., and perform specific actions based on the type of `key`.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list and it reaches the condition where `key` is not a list-like, leading to calling `self.loc[key]` which is incorrect behavior as per the GitHub issue described.
3. From the runtime values of the variables, we can see that the `key_type` is incorrectly determined as `'string'`, which shows the misidentification of the key type as part of the bug.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly treating list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function incorrectly identifies the key type as a `'string'`, leading to calling `self.loc[key]` which results in incorrect behavior and a potential KeyError as described in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify list-like keys and handle them appropriately by excluding the case where the key is treated as a string. We need to adjust the conditions to handle list-like keys separately from scalar keys to align with the behavior expected based on the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like keys and handle them separately
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, list-like keys are handled separately before checking for scalar keys to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected results based on the GitHub issue description. This modification should resolve the bug and provide the correct output for list-like keys.
