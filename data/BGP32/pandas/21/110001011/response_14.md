## Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The function checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or other types of indexers and performs corresponding operations.
3. The bug seems to be related to how non-list-like indexers are handled, specifically when the key is not recognized as a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.
4. The function currently tries to access `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys, which results in a TypeError in some cases due to a mismatch in handling these non-list-like keys.

## Bug Explanation:
In the cases presented:
- Cases 1, 2, and 3 use different variations of the key as input, but the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as 'string' in all cases.
- The issue arises when the `key` is not recognized as a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, leading to the attempt to access `self.loc[key]`.
- `self.loc[key]` produces an error because the key is not in a format recognizable for this operation, resulting in a TypeError.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly distinguish non-list-like keys that are not recognized as list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.
2. Ensure that the function handles such keys in an appropriate way to avoid errors when accessing `self.loc[key]`.
3. Consider the implications of the key format and adjust the indexing operation accordingly.

## Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        result = self.loc[key]
    else:
        result = self.reindex(key)
    
    return result
```

This correction includes a check for scalar keys using `is_scalar` and directly accessing `self.loc[key]`. For unrecognized non-list-like keys, the function falls back to reindexing the Series. This modification should address the TypeError issue related to non-list-like keys.
