## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs, such as slices, data frames, tuples, and other iterable types, to retrieve values from a `Series` instance. However, the bug appears to be related to how the function deals with different types of keys when attempting to return the requested values. The issue seems to be around the logic for handling non-list-like keys, resulting in incorrect behavior and potential errors when processing such keys.

## Error Location
The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. Incorrect handling of non-list-like keys
2. Inconsistencies in checking key types and handling them appropriately

## Bug Explanation
In the provided cases and based on the runtime values and variable types:
- The function identifies the key type as a string `'string'` in all cases, even when the key is not actually a string. This could be due to improper type inference or incorrect checks for different key types.
- The function incorrectly invokes `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys, which may not be valid for all key types.

The bug seems to stem from the function's lack of specific handling for various key types, leading to incorrect decision-making when processing the keys.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be adjusted to handle different key types properly:
1. Ensure accurate type inference for the keys and update the key type determination logic.
2. Implement specific handling for different key types to fetch values correctly.
3. Address the inconsistencies in type checking and key processing to provide consistent behavior across different key types.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check for specific key types and handle accordingly
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other cases by reindexing
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, specific checks are made for different key types, ensuring that the appropriate method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used to retrieve the values based on the key type. This adjustment aims to provide consistent and accurate handling of keys, avoiding the previous bug's behavior.
