### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` has a conditional structure to handle different types of input `key`, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and others. The issue seems to arise from the handling of a specific type of input, i.e., when `key` is a list-like object.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug likely originates in the condition when `key` is not recognized as `list_like`, which subsequently leads to incorrect processing of the input.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug can be traced back to the handling of `key` which is not accurately determining the type in some cases specifically when it is a list-like object. This results in incorrect processing and an eventual return of undesired results.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To address this bug, it is essential to ensure that the type of `key` is correctly identified and handled throughout the function. Specifically, focus on the section where the type of `key` is checked and processed based on different scenarios.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        # handle the case of ndarray, ExtensionArray, and Series
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type handling has been adjusted to ensure proper identification and processing of `key`, especially when it is `list_like`. By making these modifications, the function is more robust and aligned with the expected functionality.
