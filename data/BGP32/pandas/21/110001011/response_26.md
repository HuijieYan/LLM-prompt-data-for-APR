## Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing. Based on the provided buggy function, it seems that the function is not properly distinguishing between different key types. The issue described in the GitHub problem relates to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys. The function should differentiate between a list-like key and other types of keys to ensure consistent behavior.

## Error Locations:
1. The function does not handle list-like keys in a way that aligns with other types of keys.
2. The key type detection and handling are not appropriately handled, leading to inconsistent behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle list-like keys, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other key types. The key_type detection also seems to be flawed, causing incorrect handling of the key, leading to issues like the one reported in the GitHub problem.

## Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the key is list-like and handle it accordingly to maintain consistency.
2. Improve the key_type detection to ensure that the key is correctly identified before processing it.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
1. List-like keys are handled using `is_list_like` to ensure consistent behavior.
2. Key type detection and processing have been revised to correctly identify the key type and handle it accordingly.
