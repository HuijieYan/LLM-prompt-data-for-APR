## Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys and perform specific operations based on the key type.
2. The function contains a bug that causes incorrect handling of the key type, leading to unexpected results and errors.
3. The bug is related to how different key types are processed like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. The issue arises when dealing with key types that are not properly recognized or handled, leading to incorrect inference of the key type as `'string'`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and processed according to the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. For indexing with lists, we should aim to maintain consistency in how various key types are handled as per the expected behavior.
2. We need to ensure that `list` key types are processed correctly and avoid inaccurate inference of the key type.
3. In cases where the key is list-like, but not explicitly recognized, we should default to treating it as a list to avoid errors.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, we ensure that the function handles list-like keys correctly, maintains consistency with other key types, and avoids errors or unexpected behavior.
