## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` deals with different types of indexing keys to retrieve values from a Pandas Series. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys, especially when they are not recognized correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Issues Identified:
1. The function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'integer'` when it should be `'string'` since the key is a list containing string values.
2. The function treats non-integer keys as integers in some cases, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect identification of the key type and the subsequent inappropriate handling of non-integer keys. This leads to unexpected behavior when indexing the Series with certain key types, such as lists containing string values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and that the function appropriately handles non-integer keys, especially in the case of lists containing string values.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure to correctly identify the key type and handle non-integer keys based on their type, this corrected version should resolve the issues described in the GitHub report and provide consistent and accurate indexing behavior for the Pandas Series.
