### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method in the `Series` class of pandas that handles various types of inputs to retrieve data from a series.
2. The function first checks the type of `key` to determine the appropriate action.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys, especially when `key` is a list. The function is not handling list-like keys correctly, leading to issues with indexing.
4. The GitHub issue indicates that there are inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are treated, specifically mentioning the discrepancy when using a list key. The reported issue aligns with the observed behavior in the function.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug involves ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers and resolving the issue with list-like keys to align with the expected behavior based on the GitHub report.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list, the function fails to appropriately process it, leading to unexpected behavior during indexing operations.

### Fix:
To address the bug and align with the expected behavior and the GitHub issue, we need to modify how list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
  
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
  
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
  
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
  
    key = ensure_index(key)
  
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
  
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
  
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the fix, we check if `key` is a list-like object or a `Series` first. If it is, we directly use `self.loc[key]`. Then we ensure `key` to be an index to handle the list-like keys correctly. The code has been adjusted to provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
