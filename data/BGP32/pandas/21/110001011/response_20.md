### Analysis:
- The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexing keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
- The bug seems to occur when `key` is a list, and the function tries to determine the type of the key for further processing.
- The function then incorrectly infers the type as "string" when it should identify it as a list.

### Error Location:
- The issue arises in the `_get_with` function when handling cases where `key` is a list.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the key type inference for lists. The function infers the type of the key as "string" when it should recognize it as a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the key type inference logic to correctly identify lists as lists rather than inferring them as strings.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Correct the handling of list keys
    if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly identifies lists as lists based on their type for further processing, which should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
