### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a pandas Series. In this case, the function seems to have a bug related to handling list-like keys, as highlighted in the GitHub issue description.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition checks in the function:
   - Checking if the key is not list-like and then trying to access it using `self.loc[key]`.
   - The handling of a key that is not recognized as a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.
2. Decision making based on the inferred `key_type`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle list-like keys correctly. When a list-like key is encountered, it tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError if the key does not match any index values in `self`. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are treated.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other indexers. This includes aligning the behavior of `self.loc[key]` for list-like keys with the way other key types are treated.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled in a uniform manner, consistent with other key types, resolving the inconsistency related to accessing the Series with list-like keys.
