### Analysis:
- The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle various types of input keys for indexing.
- The issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.
- The provided test cases demonstrate different types of input keys and the resulting `key_type` is always identified as `'string'`.
- The bug might be related to how the `key_type` is determined and used in the function to select the appropriate indexing method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers. When incoming keys are processed, the `key_type` is always being incorrectly identified as `'string'`, leading to the inappropriate indexing method being selected based on the incorrect type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly identify the type of the incoming key.
2. Ensure that the correct indexing method (position-based or label-based) is chosen based on the type of the key.
3. Handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Updated logic to correctly identify key type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled and ensure that the appropriate indexing method is selected based on the type of the key being used.
