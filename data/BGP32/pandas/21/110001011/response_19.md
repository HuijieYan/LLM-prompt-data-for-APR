## Analyzing the buggy function and issue

### Buggy Function Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle indexing operations based on the type of the provided key. It includes conditions for different key types like slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others, to determine the appropriate action to take.

### Issue Analysis:
The GitHub issue highlights inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers in a `Series`. Specifically, indexing a `Series` with a list containing no matches raises a `KeyError`, while indexing with other types like a numpy array or an `Index` object returns NaN. This behavior is causing confusion and inconsistency in how indexers are handled.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of key types - The function attempts to determine the `key_type` based on the input key, which might not always accurately represent the type of the key.
2. Inconsistency in processing different key types - The current implementation does not treat all key types uniformly, leading to the reported issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from inconsistent handling of indexers, specifically when the key is a list containing no matches in the index. It results in a `KeyError` instead of returning NaN, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the bug and align with the desired behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue:
1. Ensure consistent handling of different key types.
2. Modify the logic to handle list indexers without matches more gracefully.
3. Consider the expected behavior for indexing with different types to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]  # Fallback to loc for consistency
```

This corrected version aims to address the inconsistent behavior related to indexing with list indexers, ensuring that no `KeyError` is raised in case of no matches in the index.

Following these modifications, the function should align with the expected indexing behavior based on the provided key type.
