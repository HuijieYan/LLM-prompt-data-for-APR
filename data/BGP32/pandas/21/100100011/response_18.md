### Analyzing the buggy function and relationship with test code and GitHub issue:

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling the indexing of a Series object based on different types of input keys.
2. The test code in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is checking a scenario where an index key doesn't match any of the values in the Series.
3. The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently compared to array-like indexers when indexing a Series object, leading to an unexpected KeyError for the list case.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. In the `_get_with` function, the handling of cases for different types of keys may lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with a list key that doesn't match any values in the Series.
2. The conditional checks for the type of the key and the subsequent actions taken based on that type might have issues causing the KeyError when indexing.

### Explanation of the bug:
1. The bug arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated in the `_get_with` function compared to other array-like indexers when the key doesn't match any values in the Series.
2. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError specifically for the list case, which is not expected behavior based on the GitHub issue and test scenario.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers when dealing with cases where the key doesn't match any values in the Series.
2. Adjust the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list keys appropriately to avoid the KeyError issue observed in the failing test scenario and reported in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the buggy function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Handle the case where the key doesn't match any values in the Series
    if not set(key).issubset(set(self.index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that the handling of list keys is consistent with other array-like keys and checking for the case where the key doesn't match any values in the Series, the corrected `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test scenario and address the issue reported in the GitHub.
