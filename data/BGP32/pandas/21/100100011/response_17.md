## Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function `_get_with` in the pandas source code relates to indexing operations on a Series object. The function handling different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other iterables to get values from the Series object. The bug occurs when handling list-like objects as keys, leading to inconsistent behavior with different types of key inputs.

## Identified Error Locations
1. The bug is identified in the block handling non-list-like keys. 
2. The handling of Index objects and determining the key_type leads to the wrong branch selection for integer key types.
3. The final branch reindexing the key also contributes to the inconsistent behavior.

## Cause of the Bug
In the bug function, when a list-like key is provided, if the key is an Index object or inferred as an integer key, it takes the wrong branch selection path for positional or label-based indexing, leading to incorrect indexing behavior. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test, where a key error is incorrectly raised when using a list-like key to index a Series object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list-like keys as done for other types of keys. Specifically, for list-like keys, we should aim to use label-based indexing using `self.loc` instead of reindexing the key. This will align the behavior with other key types, leading to a more consistent and correct indexing mechanism.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, for list-like keys, the function now uses `self.loc[key]` instead of reindexing the key, leading to consistent behavior across different types of keys. This fix aligns the behavior with the expected output in the failing test and addresses the bug in handling list-like keys.
