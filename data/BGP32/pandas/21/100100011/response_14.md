## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is attempting to handle different types of indexers, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, and `Index`. The bug seems to arise from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to incorrect results for certain scenarios, as highlighted in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file.

## Identified bug:
The bug lies in how the function handles the case when `key` is a list indexer and tries to convert it to a valid index, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access the element in the Series.

## Cause of the bug:
The root cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list indexer, the function does not correctly identify it as a position-based list, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the element. This inconsistency causes the function to fail for list indexers while succeeding for other types of indexers, like `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to handle the case where `key` is a list indexer consistently with other types of indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the conversion of list indexers to a valid index is done correctly, avoiding the KeyError while accessing the Series element.

## Corrected and updated function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as shown above, it ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers, addressing the bug and making the function behavior more reliable and in line with user expectations.
