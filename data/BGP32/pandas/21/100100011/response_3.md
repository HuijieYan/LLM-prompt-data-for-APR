## Correction

The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of list-like key indexers. Specifically, when a list key is passed, the function incorrectly tries to access it as a single item instead of treating it as a list of items to be indexed.

To fix this issue:
1. Update the code to properly handle list-like key indexers by converting the key to a list if it is not already in list format.
2. Ensure that the key is treated as an array-like object during indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_list_like(key)  # Ensure key is in list format

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added the `ensure_list_like` function to ensure that the key is treated as a list-like object. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread and should now correctly handle list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
