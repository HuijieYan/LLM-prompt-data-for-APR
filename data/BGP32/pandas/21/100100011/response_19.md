## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of indexers. The bug occurs when the type of `key` is a list, and it fails to handle it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file uses a list as an indexer and expects a KeyError to be raised, but the actual behavior is inconsistent with this expectation. This inconsistency is noted in the GitHub issue `API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches`.

## Bug Identification
The bug in the `_get_with` function primarily lies in the handling of the key when it is a list. The bug is triggered when the input `key` is a list, and the function tries to process it. The current implementation leads to unexpected behavior and fails to raise a KeyError when needed.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list, the function is not correctly reindexing or producing the expected KeyError as observed in the failing test.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should ensure that when `key` is a list, the function handles it properly by triggering a KeyError if the list elements are not present in the index. We need to make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

## Bug-fix and Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior specified in the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when `key` is a list, the function correctly raises a KeyError if the list elements are not present in the index, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.
