## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a Series. The function has a check for whether the key is list-like and attempts to determine the key type based on various conditions. The bug seems to be related to handling list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses different types of keys to index a Series and expects consistent behavior regardless of the type of key provided. However, due to the buggy implementation in `_get_with`, the test fails for the case when a list key is used.

## Bug Cause:
The bug originates from not handling list key indexers consistently with other types of key indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency is leading to a KeyError when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index, specifically when a list key is used.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list key indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This means aligning the behavior for list key indexers with the behavior for other key types to maintain consistency. Additionally, the function should ensure that KeyError is not raised for any type of key when accessing a value that does not exist in the index.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list key indexers in a consistent manner with other key types, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
