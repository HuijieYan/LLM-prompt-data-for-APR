## The issue:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series object using different types of indexers. This issue is highlighted in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The implementation for handling list-like keys in the function `_get_with` is not correct.
2. The logic for converting keys to list type may lead to wrong results.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug stems from the function `_get_with` not appropriately handling list indexers, resulting in different behaviors when indexing a Series object with list-like keys compared to other types of keys. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when trying to access elements that do not exist in the Series object using a list as the indexer.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list indexers the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across all types. The key conversion and indexing processes need to be revised to address this issue adequately.

## The Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key) if isinstance(self.index, ABCMultiIndex) else self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by handling list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, making sure that the behavior is the same when accessing elements in a Series object. This fix should make the function `_get_with` more robust and eliminate the KeyError when indexing with list-like keys.
