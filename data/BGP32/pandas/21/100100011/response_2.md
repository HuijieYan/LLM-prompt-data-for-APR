The issue arises from the buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file, specifically when handling key types such as a list. In the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` from the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file, the use of a list key causes a `KeyError` exception because the key is not recognized in the index.

The root cause of the bug is that different types of key indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) were not being handled consistently, leading to unexpected behavior when accessing the Series.

To fix this bug and address the inconsistency between different key indexers, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indices in a similar way to other types. By ensuring that all key types are treated consistently, we will resolve the issue raised in the GitHub thread.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, when a list key is applied to the Series, it will be handled consistently with other key types. This change should resolve the `KeyError` exception raised in the failing test, thus fixing the bug and addressing the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
