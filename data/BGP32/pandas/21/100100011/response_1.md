## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc. The buggy behavior is related to how the function treats list indexers (`list`) differently from other array-like indexers (`np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). This discrepancy leads to inconsistent behavior when accessing items in a Series using different indexers.

## Identified Issue:
The bug is in the `else` block of the `_get_with` function where it attempts to handle various types of indexers. Specifically, the issue arises when processing a `list` indexer, causing a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access items that do not exist in the Series.

The problematic code segment:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```

## Cause of the Bug:
1. When a `list` indexer is encountered, the function mistakenly converts it into a Python list regardless of its original type.
2. Converting the `key` to a list can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when accessing items that do not exist in the Series.
3. The discrepancy in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers causes inconsistency in the behavior of different indexers.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug and align the behavior of all indexers, we should avoid converting the `key` to a list explicitly. Instead, the function should correctly handle all types of indexers without causing unwanted side effects like the observed `KeyError`.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type != "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of different indexers in the corrected version, we ensure that all indexers are processed consistently and without causing unexpected errors like the `KeyError` described in the failing test.
