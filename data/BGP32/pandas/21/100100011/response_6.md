## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series object. The function checks the type of the key and performs specific actions based on the type. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like keys.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely related to how the function deals with list indexers. The current implementation returns an incorrect result or raises an error when a list-like key is encountered.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug causes undesired behavior when accessing a Series item with a list-like key. The function incorrectly checks the type of the key and does not handle list keys properly, leading to a KeyError in the test case.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys when accessing items in a Series. We should modify the logic to address list keys appropriately and avoid the KeyError raised in the failing test case.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for indexing")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version of the function, it now explicitly handles the case where the key is not list-like and not a scalar, preventing the KeyError in the failing test case.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test.
