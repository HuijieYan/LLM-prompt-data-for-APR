## Analysis:
1. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test case is checking for the behavior of selecting an element from a series using different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
2. The `buggy` function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers and selecting values accordingly from the series.
3. The bug is related to treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior and leading to a KeyError in the specific case of list indexers.

## Issue Cause:
1. The `buggy` function `_get_with` incorrectly handles the case when the key is a list type. It attempts to directly access the location based on the key, which results in a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.
2. The issue described on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers, where other indexers do not raise KeyError for missing keys like list indexers.

## Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the handling of list type keys in the `_get_with` function to align them with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
2. Instead of directly accessing the location based on the list key, handle the list case similarly to other array-like indexers to avoid KeyError when the key is missing from the index.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version, the `_get_with` function now handles list type keys like np.ndarray type keys, ensuring consistency in behavior and resolving the KeyError issue described in the GitHub post.
