## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a Series object.
2. The error location is likely in the logic that treats different types of key inputs differently, leading to inconsistent behavior.
3. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, where the list indexer (`list(key)`) raises a KeyError while other types don't. This is not aligned with user expectations and causes confusion.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers, and the error messaging is accurate and uniform.
5. The corrected version below addresses the issue by handling all indexers in a consistent manner.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    
    # Handle all types of key indexers in a consistent manner
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self._get_values_tuple((key,))

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the behavior will be consistent across different types of key indexers, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
