## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses a key that is converted to a list, which causes the buggy function to throw a `KeyError`.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the key is converted to a list properly, causing a mismatch between expected and actual behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block to correctly handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to handle scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.
2. Ensure that the case where the key is not list-like is properly handled without causing a `KeyError`.
3. Adjust the conditional checks to appropriately handle different types of keys for indexing.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block to also check if the key is not a scalar, we can accurately handle scalar values that are not recognized, resolving the `KeyError` issue. This correction aligns the behavior of indexing with list, ndarray, Index, and Series objects, addressing the bug and ensuring compatibility with the failing test case.
