The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistency when indexing with different types of indexers. Specifically, the function is not handling the case when `key` is a list indexer correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

The issue described in the GitHub post highlights this inconsistency and the specific problem related to list indexers. The test case provided in the failing test also demonstrates this problem where indexing with a list indexer leads to the `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly and consistently with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a fix for the handling of list indexers by calling `_get_values_tuple` when `key` is a list.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers correctly and consistently across different types of indexers, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub post and passing the failing test.
