After analyzing the provided code and the failing test case, the bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not handle the case where the key is a list properly. Specifically, when the key is a list, it should return the result of `self.loc[key]` instead of trying to reindex the Series with the list key.

The bug can be explained by looking at the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches`. In this test case, a Series `ser` is created with values ["A", "B"], and a key `key` is created as a Series containing ["C"] with object dtype. The key is then converted to different types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series using the `box` parameter.

When the key is a list, the current implementation tries to reindex the Series `ser` with the key `key`, which results in a KeyError because the value "C" is not in the index of the Series.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle the case where the key is a list by returning the result of `self.loc[key]` instead of calling `self.reindex(key)`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass successfully without raising a KeyError. The function now handles list keys correctly and returns the expected behavior for all supported key types.
