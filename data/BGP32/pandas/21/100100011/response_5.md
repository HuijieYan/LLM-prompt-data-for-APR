## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slice, DataFrame, tuple, and more. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of key input, specifically when the key is a list.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. Handling of list-like keys.
2. The `else` block after checking for list-like keys.
3. Returning `self.loc[key]` for non list-like keys.

## Cause of the bug:
The issue arises when indexing a Series with a list-like key, where the function should correctly handle the case of a missing match in the index. The bug results in a `KeyError` when using a list key, as seen in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.

## Strategy to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we should explicitly handle the case where a key is a list by checking for it before conversion to a list. We need to make sure the function correctly handles missing matches when dealing with list keys, to align with the expected behavior in the failing test.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly handling the case of a list key and ensuring proper indexing based on the type of key, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
