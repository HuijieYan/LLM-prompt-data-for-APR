## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test and GitHub issue:

### Bug Location:
The issue lies in the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):`, where it assumes that the key is not list-like, which includes cases where the key is scalar. This leads to incorrect behavior when indexing with specific data types like a list.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes inconsistency when indexing a Series with different datatypes like list, ndarray, Index, and Series. It results in mismatched behavior and raises a KeyError incorrectly when using list-like indexers. This inconsistency was reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address this bug, we need to revise the logic within the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` to handle list-like indexers correctly, ensuring consistency across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
The corrected version includes handling the cases of `Index`, `ExtensionArray`, and `Series` indexers explicitly, followed by checking for list-like indexers using `is_list_like`. If the key is a scalar or ndarray, it will treat it as label-based and use `loc` to access the values.

This correction ensures consistent behavior across different indexer types, resolving the inconsistency and fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue. By accurately identifying and addressing the key type, the function now properly handles indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
