The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of list-like indexers differently based on their type. When a list indexer is passed to the `ser[key]` operation in the failing test, it raises a KeyError instead of returning an empty Series as expected. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers (array-like) are handled.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently by modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert all non-Index types to a list
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have made sure that all types of indexers are converted to a list before infering the dtype and performing the necessary operations. This change ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

By updating the `_get_with` function with the above correct logic, it should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output without raising a KeyError.
