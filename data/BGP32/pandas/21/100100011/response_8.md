## Analysis
The issue arises from the `_get_with` function in the file pandas/core/series.py. The function is not handling list indexers properly, which causes inconsistencies when trying to access elements from a Series using a list as an indexer.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py illustrates the problem by using different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) to access elements from a Series. When a list indexer is used, it raises a KeyError, indicating that none of the values in the list are present in the Series index.

The GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches" highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated. The report shows that when using a list indexer, the behavior differs from array-like indexers, resulting in an unexpected KeyError.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in pandas/core/series.py does not handle list-like key indexers correctly. When a list key is passed to the function, it fails to recognize it properly and attempts to use it as a positional indexer, leading to a KeyError when the values in the list are not found in the Series index.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key indexers in a way that is consistent with how other array-like indexers are handled. The function should properly check the type of the key and perform the necessary operations based on the type to avoid the KeyError when accessing elements using a list indexer.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have included a check to handle list-like key indexers appropriately. When a list indexer is passed, it will be treated similarly to other array-like indexers, avoiding the KeyError issue. This modification ensures consistent behavior when accessing elements from a Series using different types of indexers.
