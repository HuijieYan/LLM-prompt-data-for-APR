The issue in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of the input `key`. The function is not correctly identifying the type of `key` and directing the execution accordingly, leading to a `KeyError` in the test cases.

To address this issue, we need to revise the logic for determining the type of `key` and correctly process it based on its type. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like keys as scalars or others
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list for further processing
    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == 'integer':
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == 'boolean':
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction includes handling different types of keys appropriately, checking for integers and booleans, and reindexing for other key types as needed.

This revised function should now pass the failing tests by correctly handling the input `key` and closely following the expected behavior based on the input types.
