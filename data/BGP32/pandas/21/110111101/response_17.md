### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the key parameter is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, and the key is not found in the index. The function incorrectly infers the key_type as "string" instead of "object" when dealing with these data types. This leads to the function returning a KeyError instead of correctly handling the key that is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred as "object" when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. This will allow the function to properly handle cases where the key is not found in the index without raising a KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = "object"
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the tests should pass as the key_type will now be correctly inferred as "object" for lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects. This will prevent the KeyError from being raised when the key is not found in the index.
