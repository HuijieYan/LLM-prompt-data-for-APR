### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not recognized as a list-like object. When `key` is a single scalar value, such as in Case 1, the function tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`. However, this results in a KeyError because `key` is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is not list-like, it should be directly used for locating the value in the Series rather than trying to access it as an index label. We can achieve this by updating the logic to handle scalar keys properly.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when a scalar key is provided, it is directly located from the Series without attempting to use it as an index label.
