The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the incorrect handling of key types, leading to the KeyError during indexing.

The key point of failure is in the code block:
```python
if isinstance(key, tuple):
    return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```

Based on the failing tests and runtime values, we can see that the expected type is a key of a different form (list, ndarray, Index), and the `isinstance(key, tuple)` condition does not cover these cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of different key types. We can remove the `isinstance(key, tuple)` block and replace it with a more generic approach to handle different key types appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now appropriately handle various key types and pass the failing tests without raising a KeyError.
