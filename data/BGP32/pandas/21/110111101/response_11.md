The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` variable when it is not recognized as a list-like object. The current implementation tries to use `self.loc[key]`, assuming it is a valid way to access elements, which leads to a `KeyError` in certain cases.

To address this issue, we need to modify the logic to check the `key_type` and appropriately select between `loc` and `iloc` methods to access the elements in the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for scalar values
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check for different key types and perform appropriate indexing
    key = ensure_index(key)
    if key.inferred_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key` is properly handled based on its type and ensures that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used to access the elements in the Series.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure it resolves the `KeyError` issue.
