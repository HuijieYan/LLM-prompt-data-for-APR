### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the conditional logic based on the type of the `key` parameter. The function's handling of different key types is incorrect, leading to the KeyError that is raised during the test.

1. When the `key` is a list, ndarray, or Index, the function incorrectly identifies the key as an integer and tries to access it using `iloc` rather than `loc`.
2. The function misclassifies the key type as 'integer' when it should have been identified as 'string' due to the nature of the values in the `key`.
3. This misclassification causes the function to take the wrong path in determining how to access the value from the Series, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should correctly identify the type of the key and handle it accordingly. Specifically, when the key is determined to contain string-like values (e.g., 'C'), the function should use `loc` instead of `iloc` to access the value in the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary corrections in handling different key types and ensuring the appropriate usage of `loc` for string-like keys, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.
