### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a `Series`. However, there is an inconsistency in how it treats the key when it is a list-like object, leading to a `KeyError` in specific cases where the key is a list.

### Error Location
The issue lies in the comparison and handling of the key type when it is a list-like object. Specifically, when handling `list` keys, the function currently omits properly converting them for indexing, resulting in the `KeyError`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to the function not correctly handling list-like objects as keys for the `Series`. When the key is a list, the function is not converting it into a format that can be used for indexing, leading to a mismatch with the index values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly convert list-like keys for indexing. This can involve ensuring that list keys are converted into suitable formats that match the index values of the `Series`.

### Corrected Version
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, the function ensures that list-like keys are converted to suitable data structures for proper indexing, fixing the `KeyError` discrepancy when using list keys.
