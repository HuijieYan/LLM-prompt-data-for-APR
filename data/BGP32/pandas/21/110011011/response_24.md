### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method defined within the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`.
2. The function checks the type of the input `key` and performs different operations based on the type. The bug seems to occur when `key` is of type list or ndarray.
3. The failing test is due to inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, specifically when `key` is a list.
4. The bug is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when using a list indexer.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior and suggests aligning the behavior of different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises when the input `key` is a list or ndarray, where the current implementation fails to handle these cases.
- In the failing test cases, the `key` is being converted to different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) before being passed into the `ser[key]` operation.
- The `lib.infer_dtype` function being used to determine the `key_type` is likely causing the issue when the `key` is a list or ndarray.
- The error message indicates that the key present in the `Index` is not found in the actual data index, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and align the behavior of different types of indexers:
1. Update the handling of list and ndarray indexers to be consistent with the handling of other types.
2. Ensure that the correct indexing method (either `loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the type of the `key`.
3. Avoid unnecessary conversions and ensure that the indexing operation works correctly for all types of input `key`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes as outlined in the corrected version above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle list and ndarray indexers consistently with other types, resolving the failing test and aligning the behavior with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.
