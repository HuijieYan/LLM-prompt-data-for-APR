### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library, used for indexing Series objects.
2. The error message suggests that using a list as an indexer is causing a `KeyError`.
3. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and handles different cases accordingly. However, it fails to handle the case when `key` is a list properly, leading to the `KeyError`.
4. The current implementation does not correctly handle the list indexer case, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle the case when the `key` parameter is a list. When `key` is a list, the function should treat it as a list of labels and try to locate them within the index. However, the current implementation tries to reindex the series with the list, leading to a `KeyError` as the list items are not found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with other types like arrays or indexes, which are handled differently and do not result in errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list, we should locate the elements in the Series index and return the corresponding values. This aligns with the behavior of other types like arrays or indexes. We can achieve this by changing the implementation logic for list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Adjusted handling for list indexers
        return self.loc[self.index.isin(key)]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Updated Function Explanation:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now includes a specific handling for list indexers. When `key` is a list, the function now uses the `isin` method to filter the Series based on the elements present in the list. This ensures that the values corresponding to the elements in the list are returned without causing a `KeyError`.

By implementing this change, the function now behaves consistently for different types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to inconsistent behavior when indexing with lists. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected functionality of the `Series` class.
