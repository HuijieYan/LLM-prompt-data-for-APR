### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used for handling different types of indexers (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) in a Series object.
2. The failing test cases are focused on how different types of indexers are handled, specifically when using a list as an indexer.
3. The error occurs when the indexer is of type list and the function tries to handle it but fails to do so correctly, resulting in a KeyError.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other indexer types, like arrays or Index objects, and the failure of the corresponding test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from not handling list-like indexers properly when used with a Series object. The function fails to correctly handle a list indexer, leading to a KeyError due to the inconsistency in behavior with other indexer types.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is encountered, it should be processed in a consistent manner to avoid the KeyError as reported in the failing test cases.

### Updated and Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a specific check for list indexers to ensure they are handled consistently with other indexer types, thus resolving the KeyError issue reported in the failing test cases.
