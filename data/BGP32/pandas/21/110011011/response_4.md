### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a `Series` object. The failing tests are specifically focused on the cases where the key is an array-like object (list, numpy array, or pandas Index/Series).

- Case 1: The key is a list containing a single value `'C'`. The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`.
- Case 2: The key is a numpy array `array(['C'], dtype=object)`. The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`.
- Case 3: The key is a pandas `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`. The function infers the key type correctly as `'string'`.
- Case 4: The key is a pandas `Series` object containing a single value `'C'`. The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`.

The failing tests expect a `KeyError` to be raised for these cases, but the function does not raise the error consistently depending on the type of key provided.

### Bug Cause

The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list, the function does not handle it properly, failing to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index. This inconsistency leads to failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys correctly, raising a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index. We should also ensure that the key type is properly inferred to determine the correct behavior for indexing based on the key.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("None of {} are in the index".format(key))

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly raising a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index for list-like keys, the corrected function ensures consistent behavior across different types of keys. This fix should address the failing tests and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
