### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input key values for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test indicates that when indexing a Series with a list key, it raises a `KeyError`, which is unexpected behavior compared to other types of indexers.
3. The function checks the type of the key and processes it accordingly, but the issue seems to be with the handling of a list key.
4. The bug is likely caused by a lack of proper handling for list-like keys in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the lack of proper handling for list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list, the function attempts to index the Series using `self.loc[key]`, which triggers a `KeyError` in this case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function to avoid raising a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Update to handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key].reset_index(drop=True)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when the key is a list, the function uses `self.loc[key].reset_index(drop=True)` to properly handle list-like indexers and avoid raising a `KeyError`. This adjustment ensures consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.
