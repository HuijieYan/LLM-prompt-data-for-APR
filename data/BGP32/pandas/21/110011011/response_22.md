### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different kinds of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases show that when the key is provided as a list `key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)`, the function does not handle it correctly and raises a `KeyError`.
3. The occurrence of `key_type == "integer"` check narrows down the handling of non-integer keys, potentially causing issues with non-integer keys like lists.
4. The provided error messages from the failing tests indicate that the key type is not correctly identified and processed when it is a list.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not effectively handle the case when the key is a list. There is a misinterpretation of the key type that results in the wrong branch being taken, leading to an incorrect reindexing operation. This misinterpretation causes a `KeyError` when trying to access elements based on a list key.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the key type determination logic needs to be adjusted to correctly identify list keys. By updating the logic to handle list keys appropriately, the function will be able to process list keys without raising `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False, skip_bool=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the corrected version to correctly infer the key type for list keys, the function will be able to handle list-based indexing without raising errors. This correction aligns the behavior with other types of keys in the Series.
