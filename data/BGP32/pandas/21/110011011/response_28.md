### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is used in the `Series` class for handling different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and various list-like objects.
2. The failing test cases present various forms of `key` inputs including lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series, to access elements in the `Series`.
3. The error occurs when trying to index a `Series` with a list indexer, resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with lists compared to other array-like indexers.
5. The function correctly identifies the type of indexers but fails to handle list indexers appropriately, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not handling list-like indexers correctly in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, an attempt is made to access values directly from the `loc` method, which results in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers. Handling list indexers similar to other types, such as arrays or Index, should resolve the KeyError issue.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary of Changes Made:
1. Modified the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` to `elif is_list_like(key):` to correctly handle list-like indexers.
2. Updated the flow to directly return `self.loc[key]` when the key is list-like instead of encountering a KeyError.
3. Eliminated unnecessary type checks for list indexers since list-like objects are already handled.

By making these changes, the function now handles list indexers correctly and aligns its behavior with other array-like indexers, resolving the KeyError when indexing a `Series` with lists.
