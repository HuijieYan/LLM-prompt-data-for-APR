### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers (e.g., slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc.) in a pandas Series object.
2. The failing tests are focusing on different types of key inputs, such as lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not being raised as expected when using a list indexer.
4. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as 'string' in all cases, which leads to inappropriate handling of the key in the subsequent logic.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect key_type inference, which does not distinguish between different types of key inputs. This incorrect inference leads to the wrong branch being taken in the logic for processing the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred based on the type of key input provided. This will allow the function to handle different types of indexers appropriately.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the inference of key_type and adjusting the condition checks based on the type of key input, the corrected version of the function should now handle different types of indexers correctly and pass the failing tests.
