### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in `pandas.core.series.py`.
2. The function contains logic to handle different types of indexers like slice, DataFrame, tuple, and various list-like types.
3. The bug occurs when handling a list-like key due to the inconsistent behavior compared to other indexer types, leading to a `KeyError`.
4. The failing test aims to ensure consistency in behavior when using different indexer types with `Series`.
5. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when accessing non-existing keys within a list-like object.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `_get_with` fails to handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a `KeyError` because it treats list-like objects differently from other indexers. This inconsistency in behavior causes the test to fail when trying to access non-existing keys within a list-like key object.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like keys. By treating list-like keys in the same way as other indexers, we can prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("boolean", "integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        # Handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the code to handle list-like keys in the same way as other indexers, we ensure consistent behavior and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.
