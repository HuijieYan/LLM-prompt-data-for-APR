### Analysis:
1. The `key` parameter in the buggy function can be of various types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
2. The key issue arises when `key` is a list, causing an inconsistent behavior compared to other types of `key`.
3. The failing test indicates that the KeyError is not raised as expected when using a list as `key` parameter, resulting in different behavior compared to other array-like indexers.
4. The function `_get_with` processes the `key` parameter differently based on its type, leading to incorrect handling when `key` is a list.
5. The cause of the bug is the inconsistent treatment of `key` when it is a list, as opposed to other array-like types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of `key` parameters, especially when `key` is a list.
2. Update the code to handle the list type `key` appropriately to align with the behavior of other array-like types.
3. Adjust the function logic within the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block to handle the case when `key` is a list correctly.
4. Use the provided debug information to guide the modifications in the function to address the issue effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):  # Check if scalar keys are recognized and direct to loc
            return self.loc[key]
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function as suggested above, the issue should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
