### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class has a method `_get_with` that handles different types of input `key`.
2. The failing test cases are due to the inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list compared to other array-like structures.
3. The error occurs when the function encounters a key type that is not recognized properly, leading to the incorrect handling of the indexing operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of key inputs and align the behavior with the expected output.
5. The bug relates to how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` method, causing inconsistencies and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Recognize the type of key input properly and handle the indexing operation accordingly.
2. Ensure that the behavior when indexing with a list is consistent with other array-like structures.
3. Modify the `_get_with` method to address the key type differences and provide the expected output.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = key.tolist()

    if is_scalar(key[0]) and not is_object_dtype(self.index):
        if key[0] not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {[key[0]]} are in the [index]")
        key = self.index.get_loc(key[0])

    if is_object_dtype(self.index):
        key = key[0] if len(key) == 1 else key

    return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` method with the corrected version provided above, the function is modified to handle different types of key inputs consistently, ensuring proper indexing behavior and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
