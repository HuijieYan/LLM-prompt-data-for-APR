### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of input keys, like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
2. The failing test cases are focused on using different types of key inputs like lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series and encountering `KeyError`.
3. The key error appears to arise due to inconsistency in how list-like key inputs are handled compared to other types.
4. The primary issue seems to be related to how the function treats different types of keys and how it interacts with the series index.

### Bug Identification
1. The function treats list-like keys differently, leading to `KeyError` in certain cases.
2. The key type is inferred as `'string'` regardless of the actual key type passed.
3. The function does not handle certain types of indexers consistently.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is passed, it leads to a `KeyError` due to an attempt to reindex with that key, resulting in data not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure consistent handling of different key types.
2. Identify the key type correctly.
3. Make sure the function retrieves data properly based on the key type.
4. Avoid reindexing with a list key, as it may not directly correspond to the index.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling different key types
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that list-like keys are correctly converted to lists and then handled appropriately, this corrected code aims to resolve the issue reported in the failing test cases related to inconsistent behavior with different key types. Remember to test thoroughly with the provided failing test cases to verify the fix.
