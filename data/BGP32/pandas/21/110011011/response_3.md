### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, Series, and Index. It aims to determine the type of key and process it accordingly.
2. The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the function, triggering an error related to NaN values that are not present in the index.
3. The error message indicates that the function fails to raise the expected KeyError when dealing with a list-like key, resulting in incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of list-like keys in a way consistent with other indexers and ensure proper key validation to avoid unexpected errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other types of indexers like arrays or Series. The function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access values not present in the index. This inconsistency impacts the behavior of the function and results in failing tests as described.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic within the function to handle list-like keys in a manner consistent with other indexers.
2. Ensure that the function properly validates list-like keys to prevent KeyError exceptions when accessing non-existent values.
3. Update the key processing steps to align the behavior with the expected output, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys in a consistent manner
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            # Reindex with the key to ensure proper handling
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected version above, the handling of list-like keys is improved, resolving the inconsistent behavior and the KeyError issues encountered during the tests.
