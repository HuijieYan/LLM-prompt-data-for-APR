### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Analysis**:
   - The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing. It checks the type of the key and then performs specific operations based on the type.
   - The bug seems to be related to how the function handles `list` key inputs.
  
2. **Error Location**:
   - The issue is likely in the part of the function that handles `list` key inputs, as indicated by the failing tests related to different types of key inputs.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The bug causes incorrect behavior when trying to index a Series with a `list` key.
   - The function wrongly treats the `list` key as an `Index` object rather than a list, leading to a `KeyError`.
   - The different behavior for different key types contradicts the expected behavior based on the provided GitHub issue information.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Ensure that all types of key inputs are treated consistently.
   - Specifically, when the key is of type `list`, it should be handled in a similar manner to other array-like inputs such as `ndarray` or `Index`.
   - Update the handling of `list` keys to avoid the incorrect conversion or inference that leads to the `KeyError`.

### Bug-fixed Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle `list` keys in a more consistent manner with other array-like inputs, the bug should be fixed. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's suggestion to make the behavior consistent across different key types.
