### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexing key inputs and return the corresponding values from the series.
2. The error message indicates that there is an issue when using a list as the key for indexing, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The function checks the type of the key input to determine how to handle it and retrieve the values from the series.
4. The bug lies in the conditional block where a list-like key is handled. The issue is related to how the function is treating the key and the reindexing operation.
5. The error occurs due to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of key inputs in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list-like key is used for indexing, the function erroneously triggers a reindex operation, which subsequently leads to a `KeyError` due to the mismatch between the key and the series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers used as keys for indexing the series. We should avoid triggering the reindex operation when dealing with list-like keys to prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the function to return `self.loc[key]` directly when dealing with list-like keys, we can ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and prevent the occurrence of a `KeyError`. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and pass the failing tests.
