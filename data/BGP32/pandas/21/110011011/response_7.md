### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a part of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
2. The failing test cases are trying to index the `Series` object using different types of keys like lists, ndarray, Index, and Series, which are not handled correctly in the `_get_with` function.
3. The key variable is being checked for type in various sections of the function, but the handling for lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series is not consistent, leading to the KeyError during indexing.
4. The bug is causing inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different types of objects, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly processing the key when it is of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series, leading to a KeyError during indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all types of keys (lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series) consistently and appropriately. We should update the logic to correctly process these different types of keys during indexing to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_arr = np.asarray(key)

    if len(key_arr) == 1:
        if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):  # Handle list, Series, Index
            key_arr = key_arr[0]

    if is_scalar(key_arr):  # Handle scalar values that are recognized
        return self.loc[key_arr]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_arr, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key_arr]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key_arr]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key_arr]

    return self.reindex(key_arr)
```

This corrected version will handle different types of keys consistently and appropriately, ensuring that indexing with lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series works as expected.
