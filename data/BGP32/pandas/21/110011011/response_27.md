### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class contains a conditional structure to handle different types of input keys. The issue arises when dealing with a list-like key in the `key` variable. The code does not handle a list key properly, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other indexers like ndarray or Index.

In the failing tests, the input `key` is being transformed into different types like list, ndarray, and Index. However, when `key` is a list, the current implementation fails to index the Series correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

The code should properly handle list-like keys to ensure consistency and avoid errors for users expecting standard behavior across different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug stems from the inadequate handling of list-like keys within the `_get_with` function.
- When a list key is encountered, the current implementation fails to properly index the Series, leading to a `KeyError`.
- This inconsistent behavior between list-like keys and other types of indexers causes confusion and possible errors for users.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. One way to address this issue is by checking the type of the `key` variable and implementing appropriate indexing logic based on that type. We should handle list keys similarly to other indexers to maintain consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating proper handling for list-like keys, the corrected version ensures consistency across different types of indexers and resolves the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing tests.
