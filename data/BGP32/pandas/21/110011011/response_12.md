## Bug Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values. However, the bug is causing key errors when using certain types of indexers, like lists.
   
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the key indexers, specifically when the key indexer is a list. This is causing a key error in the tests.

3. The bug is likely caused by the different treatment of list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is encountered, it's not being processed correctly, leading to key errors.

4. To fix the bug, the function needs to handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, ensuring that the correct values are returned without causing key errors.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a specific check for list indexers and numpy array indexers to handle them consistently with other types of indexers. This fix ensures that the function processes all types of indexers correctly and returns the expected values without causing key errors.
