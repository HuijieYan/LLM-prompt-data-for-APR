### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error occurs when trying to index the Series using a list key.
3. The function checks the type of key and attempts to handle it appropriately based on the type.
4. The key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, leading to an incorrect path through the conditional statements.
5. The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior for indexing with a list key is inconsistent with other types of keys.
6. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistencies in indexing behavior when using different types of keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect inference of the key type as `'string'`, leading to the wrong path being taken in the conditional statements. This incorrect inference results in incorrect behavior when indexing with a list key, causing the KeyError in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the key type inference logic needs to be corrected to correctly identify the type of the key provided for indexing. This will ensure that the appropriate path is taken in handling the indexing operation based on the key type.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the key type inference logic and ensuring that the appropriate path is taken for a list key, the function should now handle indexing operations correctly for different types of keys, passing the failing tests and resolving the GitHub issue.
