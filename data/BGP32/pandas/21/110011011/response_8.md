### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series` object. The error occurs when indexing with a list-like key, causing a `KeyError` instead of properly handling the indexing operation.

### Error Location
The error is likely in the section of the function that is supposed to handle list-like keys.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to a discrepancy in how different types of keys are handled. In this case, when indexing with a list-like key, the function fails to properly reindex the `Series` object, leading to a `KeyError`. The handling of indexers like lists doesn't align with other types of indexers like arrays or index objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled in a consistent and correct manner for indexing the `Series` object. The function should properly reindex based on a list key if it is provided.

### Correction
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly handling list-like keys along with other acceptable key types (arrays, index objects), the corrected function should now correctly handle the indexing operation, passing the failing tests and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
