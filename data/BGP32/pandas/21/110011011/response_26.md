### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling different types of key input correctly, specifically when the key is a list. The function includes multiple conditional checks based on the type of the key input, but it fails to properly handle cases where the key is a list. This results in inconsistent behavior and raises a `KeyError`.

The error occurs when attempting to access a Series with another Series passed as a key, specifically when the key is provided as a list. The function has different behavior for key types like `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, causing inconsistencies in the indexing process.

Based on the provided error messages and runtime values, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` when the key is a list. This incorrect inference leads to improper indexing attempts, resulting in a `KeyError` and failed tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and align the behavior for all key types when indexing a Series, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle a list-like key input correctly. This includes ensuring that the function properly identifies the key type as a list, utilizes proper indexing methods, and avoids raising a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns the behavior for all key types when accessing a Series:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that indexing a Series with different types of key inputs behaves consistently and handles list-like keys properly without raising a `KeyError`.
