### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing the Series object.
2. The bug appears to be related to how list-like keys are handled compared to other types (arrays, indexes, Series).
3. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when trying to index the Series with a list key, even though it is not consistent with how other types of keys are handled.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled properly, similar to how other indexers are processed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to index the Series with a list key. This inconsistency is causing failures in the tests.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Check if the key is an instance of `list` and handle it appropriately to avoid the KeyError.
2. Modify the implementation to treat list keys similarly to other types of keys used for indexing the Series.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self._get_values(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the inconsistency in handling list-like keys for indexing a Series object in pandas.
