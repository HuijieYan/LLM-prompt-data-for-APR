### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series object. The function determines the type of `key` and performs the corresponding indexing operation.
2. The failing tests are due to inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`).
3. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `list` type as an indexer, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing tests.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior and proper handling of all types of indexers.
5. The key issue on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior with the `list` case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When indexing with a `list`, the function fails to properly handle the indexing operation, leading to a `KeyError` during the test execution.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle `list` indexers correctly. By aligning the behavior with other types of indexers, we can ensure consistent and accurate indexing operations.

### Bug-fixed version of the function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
            key = key.tolist()
    
        return self.loc[key]
```

By making the above corrections to the function, the bug should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass successfully.
