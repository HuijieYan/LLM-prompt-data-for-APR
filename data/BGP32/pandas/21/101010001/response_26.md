### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys to extract values from a `Series` object. The failing tests are related to different types of keys passed to the `ser[key]` operation, causing a `KeyError`. The bug is happening because the code path for handling keys that are not `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`, or `ExtensionArray` is incorrect, leading to the incorrect execution of the function.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the section of the code handling keys that are not of the mentioned types. The code is trying to convert the key into a list in one of the branches without proper validation, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of keys that are not recognized as `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`, or `ExtensionArray`. The code tries to convert any key that doesn't fall into these categories into a list, causing issues with key indexing later on.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of keys that don't fall into the recognized types does not convert the key into a list directly. Instead, we should follow an appropriate code path based on the type of the key provided.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version, we've added a validation to raise a `TypeError` if an unsupported key type is encountered instead of converting it directly to a list. This ensures that the code follows the proper code path for handling keys based on their types.
