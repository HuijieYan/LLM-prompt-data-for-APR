### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexing keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists. It makes a decision based on the type of key and then retrieves values from the Series object accordingly. The primary issue occurs when trying to index with a key that is not recognized as a list-like object. The function then attempts to use `self.loc[key]`, causing a `KeyError` in certain cases.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for non-list-like keys may not correctly handle all cases.
2. The fallback to `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys may produce the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a key that is not list-like. The function attempts to use `loc` indexing, which raises a `KeyError` if the value is not present in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
Update the function to correctly handle non-list-like keys by adding a condition to check for scalar keys before trying to use `loc` indexer.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle specific key types
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not in the index")

    # Proceed with list-like keys
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking for scalar keys before trying to use `loc` and raising a `KeyError` if the key is not found, the corrected function should handle non-list-like keys without causing a `KeyError`.
