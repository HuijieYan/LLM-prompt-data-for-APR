### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values from a Series object based on the key provided. The bug seems to be related to how different key types are handled.
- For `key` elements that are not list-like, the function tries to use `self.loc[key]` to retrieve elements.
- For `key` elements that are list-like, the function checks if the `key` is an instance of `Index` and then determines the `key_type` to decide whether to use `iloc` or `loc`.
- The bug seems to be occurring when `key` is an instance of `Series` or `Index` where it fails to return the correct values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by not correctly handling the case when `key` is an instance of `Series` or `Index`, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and subsequently causing the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that instances of `Series` or `Index` are appropriately handled in the `_get_with` function.
2. Check the methods used to retrieve values based on the type of key provided.
3. Correct the logic to properly handle `key` as instances of `Series` or `Index` to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    
    # handle special cases
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        
        # Ensure key is a list for further processing
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = list(key)
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)
        
        # Handle integer key indexing
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle list-like key indexing
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating these changes, the corrected version should now handle instances of `Series` and `Index` correctly, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
