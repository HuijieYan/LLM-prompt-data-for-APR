1. The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different cases for indexing a `Series` object based on the type of the key provided. It checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like type, and then performs the corresponding operation. The error message indicates that the bug is causing a `KeyError` to be raised incorrectly when indexing with different types (list, numpy array, Index, or Series).

2. The potential error locations within the `_get_with` function are the conditions where it checks the type of the key and chooses the corresponding operation based on the type.

3. The cause of the bug is most likely due to incorrect handling of the keys in the `if` conditions, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised even when it's not expected. The bug occurs when handling different types of keys, leading to an incorrect behavior for certain key types.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct path of execution is taken based on the type of the key. In the failing test cases provided, it's expected that the key is validated against the series index before returning a subset of the series with the specified keys.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the correct path is followed for different types of keys and making necessary adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing tests.
