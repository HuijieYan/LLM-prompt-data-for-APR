The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by the incorrect handling of various types of `key` inputs. The function is unable to process certain input types correctly, leading to the failing tests.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` which tries to directly access `self.loc[key]` for scalars not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.
2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` and subsequent type handling might lead to issues with `key` types that are not properly handled.

To fix the bug, we need to update the way the different `key` types are handled. We can simplify the logic and improve the type checking to correctly access the values from the Series depending on the input type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- We ensure that `key` is transformed into an Index using `ensure_index`.
- We check the `inferred_type` of the key directly from the Index object and use it for further processing.
- By directly using `ensure_index`, we ensure that `key` is correctly converted into an Index for handling duplicates and indexing cases.

This corrected version should pass the failing tests provided.
