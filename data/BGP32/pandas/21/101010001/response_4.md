### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc., and then performing indexing accordingly.
2. The failing tests indicate that when using different types of boxes (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) as keys for indexing, a KeyError is expected to be raised, but it is not raised due to a bug in the `_get_with` function.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key parameter and determines the key type for indexing. It fails to correctly identify the key type in some cases, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to improve the key type identification logic and ensure that the function behaves consistently based on the type of key provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Correctly identify the type of the key being passed for indexing.
2. If the key is a list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, ensure that the key type is correctly determined.
3. Update the conditional checks for different key types to handle each case appropriately for indexing.
4. Ensure that the function falls back to positional indexing when necessary and that duplicate indexing cases are handled correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether self.iloc or self.loc should be used
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type identification and indexing logic in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should now accurately handle different types of keys for indexing, fixing the bug and passing the failing tests.
