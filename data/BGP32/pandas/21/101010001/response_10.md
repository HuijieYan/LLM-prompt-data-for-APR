### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. When the key is a list-like object (e.g., list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series), the bug seems to be causing a `KeyError` during indexing.
3. The error messages indicate that the function fails to handle these types of keys, leading to the test failures.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys for indexing without raising a `KeyError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The bug might be related to the way list-like keys are processed within the function.
2. Incorrect handling of keys that are instances of list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, or pd.Series might be causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the improper handling of list-like keys. The function attempts to index the Series object using a key that is a list-like object, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Proposed Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is a list or list-like object.
2. If the key is a list or a list-like object, handle the indexing differently for these cases to prevent `KeyError`.
3. Modify the logic to correctly retrieve values in the case of list-like keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the last part of the function to handle list objects correctly for indexing, we aim to resolve the `KeyError` issue during indexing with list-like keys.
