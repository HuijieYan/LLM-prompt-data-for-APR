### Analysis:
The buggy function is `_get_with(key)` within the `Series` class. This function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or other types like a single value or a list-like object. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles keys that are neither lists, numpy arrays, nor Index objects.

The error messages indicate that the bug occurs when trying to raise a `KeyError` exception, but the error is not being raised as expected. The function should throw a `KeyError` exception when the key does not match any values in the index.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when trying to handle a key that is neither a list, a numpy array, nor an Index object. In this case, the function attempts to interpret the key as a list but does not correctly raise an exception when the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key belongs to the index of the Series.
2. If the key is not found in the index, raise a `KeyError` exception.

### Correction:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if the key is in the index
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version adds a check to see if the `key` is present in the Series index before trying to retrieve the value. If the `key` is not found in the index, a `KeyError` exception is raised. This strategy ensures that the function behaves correctly and throws an error when the key is not present in the index.
