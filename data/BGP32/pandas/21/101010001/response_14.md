## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys and performing appropriate operations based on the key type. The test cases that are failing are trying to index a Series using various types like list, numpy array, Index, and another Series.

## Issues
1. The bug is likely in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list, array, Index, or Series, as shown by the failing test cases.
2. The bug is causing a `KeyError` to not raise when attempting to access elements in the Series using the provided key.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to the incorrect handling of the list, array, Index, or Series type keys. The conditional logic is not diverting the flow correctly to the appropriate actions based on the type of key provided.

## Fix Strategy
1. Add separate handling for Index and Series types to ensure the correct behavior when using these types as keys.
2. Make sure to raise a `KeyError` when the desired index is not found during the access operation.
3. Adjust the conditional checks to correctly identify and handle list and numpy array keys.


## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and all(self.index.isin(key)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not is_scalar(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{repr(key)} not in index")

    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    raise KeyError(f"{repr(key)} not in index")
```

This corrected version should address the issue with correctly handling the keys of different types, ensuring that a `KeyError` is raised when an index is not found during the access operation, as expected by the failing test cases.
