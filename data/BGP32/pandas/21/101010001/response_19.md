### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. It takes a key as an input parameter and performs different operations based on the type of the key.
2. The error messages indicate that when trying to perform indexing on a `Series` object using different key types such as a list, numpy array, pandas `Index`, or another `Series`, a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected.
3. The bug in the function likely occurs when handling different types of keys and deciding whether to perform positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`), resulting in incorrect behavior.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the key is correctly identified and handled based on its type to address the indexing error.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, pd.Series):
            key = key.array
    
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Check key type and perform proper indexing
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly converting the key to a list before checking its type and handling different key types, we ensure that the correct indexing operation is performed using `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type. This fix addresses the bug in the `_get_with` function and should pass the failing tests.
