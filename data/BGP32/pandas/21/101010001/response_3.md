1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list-like objects) to retrieve values from the Series object. The bug seems to be related to how the key is processed and then used for indexing within the function.

2. Potential error locations within the `_get_with` function:
   - Incorrect handling or conversion of key types.
   - Incorrect branching logic based on key types.
   - Incorrect usage of `loc` and `iloc` for indexing.

3. The cause of the bugs:
   - The error messages indicate that the function is failing to correctly raise a KeyError when indexing with certain types of keys.
   - The handling of different key types (such as Index, Series, list, ndarray) is not consistent, leading to indexing errors.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the key is correctly processed and its type is identified consistently.
   - Check the conditions for different key types and handle them appropriately using `loc` and `iloc` based on the type.
   - Make sure that the function raises a KeyError when the key type is not supported.

5. Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = np.asarray(key)
        
        if is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if self.index.inferred_type == "integer":
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle different types of keys consistently, use `loc` and `iloc` properly based on the key type, and raise a KeyError if the key is not found in the index.
