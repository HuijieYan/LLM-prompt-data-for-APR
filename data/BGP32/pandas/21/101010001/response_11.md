### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle indexing operations for a pandas Series object. The function checks the type of the key being passed, and based on the type, performs specific operations like slicing, checking for DataFrame, tuples, and other types.

The failing tests indicate that the function is not able to handle indexing when the key is of certain types like list, np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series, and is raising a `KeyError`.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the section of code where the key is being checked and converted to a list if it is not one of the expected types. The error occurs when attempting to index with a type other than Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, especially when a pd.Index or pd.Series is passed as the key.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not consider checking for `isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series)` explicitly before trying to handle the key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the key type checking logic to include checking for `pd.Index` and `pd.Series` types explicitly before handling the key. We need to ensure that the key is converted to a list only when it does not match these specific types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        # If key is Index or Series, behavior should be the same as for scalars
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking for `isinstance(key, Index)` and `isinstance(key, Series)` before attempting to handle the key and converting it to a list only when necessary, the corrected version of the function should now be able to handle the different key types correctly and execute without raising `KeyError` for the given failing tests.
