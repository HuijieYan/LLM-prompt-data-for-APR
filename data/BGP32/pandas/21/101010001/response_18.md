### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and more.
2. The failing tests indicate that the KeyError is not being raised as expected when passing a key of type `Index`, `Series`, or `list`.

### Error:
The error occurs because the logic inside the `if` condition for type checking keys does not handle the scenarios for `Index`, `Series`, or `list` correctly. It wrongly attempts to treat them as `list` and performs operations accordingly, which leads to the KeyError not being raised when it should.

### Solution:
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling keys of type `Index`, `Series`, or `list` to ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the type of the key passed.
2. Update the logic for checking and handling different types of key inputs to avoid misinterpretation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By converting `key` to a list in the case of `Index` and `Series`, and addressing the correct operations for different key types, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
