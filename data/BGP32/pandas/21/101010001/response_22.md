**Analysis:**

The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue when the key is a Series, a list, or an ndarray. The error message suggests that a KeyError is not being raised when expected.

**Potential Error Locations:**

1. The issue might be in the part of the code where handling different key types, specifically when the key is a Series, list, or ndarray.
2. The check for `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` raises an error if the key is a DataFrame, but there is no corresponding condition for handling a Series key.

**Cause of the Bug:**

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` method does not handle Series, list, or ndarray keys correctly. It does not have a specific condition to deal with the situation when the key is a Series, which is causing the KeyError not to be raised as expected in the failing tests.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**

1. Add a condition to handle the case when the key is a Series.
2. Check if the key is an instance of a Series first and handle it separately in the `_get_with` function.

**Modified and Corrected Version:**

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
      
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
      
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
      
        elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
            return self._get_values_tuple(list(key))
      
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        key = ensure_index(key)

        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle the case when the key is an instance of a Series. By converting it to a list before calling `_get_values_tuple(key)`, we ensure that the correct behavior is followed. Additionally, we perform `ensure_index(key)` to handle the case where the key needs to be converted to an Index format for further processing.
