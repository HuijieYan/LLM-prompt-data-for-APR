## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of input keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Indexes.

2. The failing test indicates that when attempting to access a key that does not exist in the Series object, a `KeyError` is not being raised as expected. This suggests that the logic to handle missing keys is incorrect.

3. The function is attempting to infer the type of the key and then decide on the appropriate action based on the inferred type.

4. The bug seems to be related to the handling of keys that are neither lists nor numpy arrays nor ExtensionArrays nor Series nor Indexes when determining how to retrieve the data.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Inspect the logic within the function that deals with determining the type of the key and how to retrieve the data based on that type.
2. Make sure to handle the case where the key type is not within the expected types properly to prevent the missing key from causing an error.
3. Update the logic to raise a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the Series object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # Existing functions and declarations

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            raise KeyError(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        raise KeyError(key)
```

In the corrected version, if the key is not recognized as any of the expected types, a `KeyError` is raised to indicate that the key is not found in the Series object. This fix should address the issue highlighted by the failing test cases.
