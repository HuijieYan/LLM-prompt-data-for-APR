### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is used to retrieve values from a Series based on the provided key. The bug seems to be related to different types of the key (list, ndarray, Index, Series) that are not handled correctly within the function.

The error messages indicate that a `KeyError` is expected when indexing using certain key types (list, ndarray, Index, Series), but it is not being raised as expected, which implies that the `_get_with` function is not behaving correctly.

### Bug Identification
1. The function does not handle the case when `key` is an instance of `Index` or a `list` correctly. This leads to incorrect behavior when indexing with these types.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the logic for handling different types of keys in the `_get_with` function is incomplete. When the key is an instance of `Index` or a `list`, the function incorrectly processes it, leading to unexpected behavior and failure to raise an expected `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle different types of keys such as `Index` and `list`. This will ensure that the function behaves as expected and can raise `KeyError` when necessary.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        return self._getitem_with_indexer(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the key is an `Index` using `ensure_index` and handle it appropriately. Additionally, we cover all key types to avoid unexpected behavior.
