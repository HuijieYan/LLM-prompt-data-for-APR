### Analysis:
The error messages indicate that the key used for indexing is not found in the index of the Series, resulting in a KeyError. This error occurs when trying to access elements in the Series with keys that are not present in the index.

### Bugs Location:
The bug is likely to be in the `_get_with` function where different key types are being processed and dispatched to either `loc` or `iloc`, leading to a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the key is not present in the index of the Series, but the implementation of the `_get_with` function assumes that the key will always be present in the index. This leads to the KeyError when attempting to access an element with a non-existent key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the scenario where the key used for indexing is not present in the index by catching the KeyError and returning an appropriate response, such as raising an error or returning a default value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            try:
                return self.loc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"KeyError: '{key}' not found")
        else:
            try:
                return self.iloc[key]
            except KeyError:
                raise KeyError(f"KeyError: '{key}' not found")

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"KeyError: '{key}' not found")

    try:
        return self.reindex(key)
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"KeyError: '{key}' not found")
```

In the corrected version, we have added try-except blocks to catch the KeyError that might occur if the key is not present in the index. In case of a KeyError, we raise a new KeyError with a message indicating that the key was not found. This modification ensures better error handling for keys not present in the Series index.
