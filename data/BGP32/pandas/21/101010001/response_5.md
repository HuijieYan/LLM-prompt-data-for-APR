### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling the slicing, indexing, and reindexing operations on a `Series` object in pandas. The bug seems to occur when handling different types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, list-likes, etc. The failing test cases provide examples where the expected KeyError is not being raised.

### Issues:
1. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Box`, which includes `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`.
2. The function `_get_with` does not handle the case where the key is a `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series` properly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inappropriate handling of list-like inputs (`box`) while indexing a `Series`. The current implementation does not support list-like keys correctly, leading to the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the list-like keys such as `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, ensuring that the expected KeyError is raised when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # If the key is not list-like, try to access it using self.loc
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]

    if not key.is_unique:
        raise KeyError(f"Key must be unique: {key}")

    if not key.isin(self.index).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the key is converted into an `Index` object using `ensure_index`, and then checking for uniqueness and presence in the Series index, we can prevent the KeyError from being suppressed and correctly handle list-like keys when indexing the Series.
