### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values based on the key provided. The bug arises when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, leading to an indexing error.

### Bug Identification:
The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where it checks if the key is a list-like object. If the key is not a list-like object, it attempts to use the `loc` method directly, which can result in a KeyError if the key does not exist in the index.

### Bug Explanation:
When the key is provided as a list-like object, the function properly proceeds to handle the key. However, when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, it directly uses the `loc` method on the key. If the key is not present in the index, it raises a KeyError, leading to the test cases failing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
A suggested strategy to fix the bug would be to handle non-list-like keys differently to avoid the KeyError. It may involve validating the key or restructuring the logic to prevent direct use of the `loc` method on such keys.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert single value to a list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By converting a single key value to a list when it is not recognized as a list-like object, we prevent the KeyError scenario and ensure that the correct key handling logic is applied. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
