**Analyzing the buggy function:**

The buggy function `_get_with` is a method within the `Series` class in pandas. It takes a `key` as input and performs different operations based on the type of `key`.

**Errors in the buggy function:**

1. The error handling for specific cases such as when `key` is an instance of `list`, `Index`, `np.ndarray`, etc., is faulty and leading to the failing tests.

**Cause of the bug:**

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `key` type within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when `key` is converted to a list, the subsequent conditional checks do not properly distinguish between different types of list-like objects, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to appropriately handle the different types of `key` to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

**Corrected version of the function:**

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By properly handling scalar and list-like keys, as well as refining the logic for indexing operations, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should fix the issues identified in the failing tests.
