#### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, and corresponding error message
The buggy function `_get_with` is called when attempting to get values from a Series using a key. The function checks the type of the key and processes it accordingly. The error messages suggest that the issue arises when trying to get values from the Series using different kinds of keys such as lists, arrays, Index objects, or Series objects.

#### Potential error locations within the buggy function
The issue could potentially arise in the sections of the code that handle different types of keys. Specifically, the if-elif-else blocks could be causing the problem due to unintended logic flow or incorrect handling of key types.

#### Explanation of the cause of the bug using the buggy function and related functions
The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of different key types within the `_get_with` function. The TypeError exception is raised when the key is of type DataFrame, but the error messages indicate that the issue happens when handling keys of types list, np.array, Index, or Series.

In the failing test cases, scenarios involving different types of keys are used, leading to a KeyError because the index does not contain the specified values within those keys.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that each key type is correctly handled to avoid KeyError exceptions. This involves validating the logic for different key types, and making sure that the appropriate operation is performed based on the key type.

#### Corrected version of the buggy function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        key = key.tolist() if hasattr(key, 'tolist') else key
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version handles different key types appropriately, converting them to a list if needed, and then using the `loc` or `iloc` attribute based on the key type. The previous issues related to keys of different types causing a KeyError should now be resolved with this fix.
