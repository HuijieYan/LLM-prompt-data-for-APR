Based on the error messages provided by the failing tests, the issue seems to be related to handling different types of input keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. 

The bug seems to be in the section of the code where different types of input keys are being checked. To fix this issue, we need to handle the different types of keys separately and make sure the appropriate indexing method is used.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for scalar key

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Wrap key in a list to support Index and Series
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles different types of input keys by explicitly checking if the key is a scalar before directly using `loc` for indexing. It also ensures that the key is always wrapped in a list to support Index and Series inputs.

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle various types of input keys and pass the failing tests.
