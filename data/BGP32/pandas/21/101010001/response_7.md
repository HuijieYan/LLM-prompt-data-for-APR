## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling the retrieval of data from the series based on the input key provided. The function handles different types of keys (slice, tuple, DataFrame, list-like, etc.) and decides whether to return the result based on position or label indexing. The failing tests seem to be focusing on checking behavior when the input key is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The logic to handle the key type, especially the case when `key` is not found in the index, might be incorrect.
2. The method of indexing or reindexing the data could be causing the issue.

## Bug Cause
The bug might be caused by an incorrect handling of the key type when it is not present in the index. The failing tests are expecting a `KeyError` to be raised in such cases, but the current implementation is not raising it correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
We need to ensure that when the key is not found in the index, the function raises a `KeyError` to reflect the behavior expected by the failing tests.

## Corrected Version
```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):

    # ... other functions omitted for clarity ...

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )

        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        else:
            # Check if the key is not present in the index
            if not is_list_like(key):
                if key not in self.index:
                    raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
                return self.loc[key]
    
            if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
                key = list(key)
    
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
        
            if isinstance(key, list):
                return self.loc[key]
        
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, an additional check has been added to verify if the key is not present in the index. If the key is not found, a `KeyError` is raised to match the behavior expected by the failing tests. This modification should fix the bug and make the function behave as intended.
