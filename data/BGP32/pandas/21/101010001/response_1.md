### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys that can be used to index a Series.
2. The error message indicates that when testing the behavior of indexing with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series), the function is not raising a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key types within the function.
4. The bug is likely causing the function to not properly raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the function correctly handles all types of keys and raises a `KeyError` when needed.

### Bug Fix:
The main fix involves correctly handling the key types and properly raising a `KeyError` when needed. Modify the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) or not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index.is_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `is_scalar(key)` and `ensure_index(key)`, we ensure that single keys are properly converted to lists of keys and then to an Index object. This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the function raises a `KeyError` when necessary.
