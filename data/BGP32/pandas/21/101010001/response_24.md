## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys used for indexing a Series. However, it fails to properly handle certain types of keys leading to errors like `KeyError`.

In the cases where the key is an instance of `Index`, `list`, or some other data types, the function incorrectly tries to assign `key` to a list instead of applying the correct indexing operation. This leads to incorrect indexing and hence the error.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the different types of keys for indexing. When the function encounters instances of `Index`, `list`, or some other data types, it tries to treat them all as lists regardless of the actual key type. This leads to the wrong indexing approach and triggers the `KeyError`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key being used for indexing. For cases where the key is already of type `Index` or `list`, we should directly use it for indexing. Additionally, we should ensure that the correct indexing method, either `loc` or `iloc`, is used based on the key type.

## The corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        pass  # No need to convert key
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these corrections, the function now differentiates between different types of keys correctly, determines the appropriate indexing method, and handles the indexing operation accordingly. This should resolve the bugs leading to `KeyError` in the failing tests.
