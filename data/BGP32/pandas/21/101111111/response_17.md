To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. The issue arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers.

The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the last `elif` clause in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle a list key. We need to ensure that when the key is a list, it is passed to the `self.loc` method rather than treating it as a generic index when trying to reindex. This adjustment will align the behavior with other indexers like ndarrays, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the list indexing correctly
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function now handles list indexers correctly, aligning its behavior with other array-like indexers such as ndarrays, pd.Index, and pd.Series. This modification ensures consistency in indexing operations across different types of indexers.
