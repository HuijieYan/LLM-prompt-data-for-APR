To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to adjust the handling of different types of indexers to align with the expected behavior, particularly when dealing with lists. The issue arises when indexing a Series using a list, causing the KeyError due to inconsistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list-like indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of indexing with a list
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of list-like indexers to treat them consistently and avoid the KeyError issue. Now, the function should work as expected based on the provided failing test cases.

By making this adjustment, the function should pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values for different indexer types, addressing the issue described in the linked GitHub report.
