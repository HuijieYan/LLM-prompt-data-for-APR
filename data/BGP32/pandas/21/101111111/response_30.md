To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. The issue arises when using a list indexer, which triggers a KeyError due to the mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual handling of list indexers compared to other types like arrays or Index objects.

The key issue is that for list indexers, the function attempts to use the `reindex` method, which leads to the KeyError when the index element is not found in the original index.

To resolve this bug and make the function consistent with other types of indexers, we need to handle list-like indexers using `loc` to provide the same behavior as with arrays or Index objects. Additionally, we should avoid unnecessary conversions and ensure that the indexing behavior is consistent across different types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these adjustments, the function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types, ensuring that the correct behavior is maintained and resolving the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.
