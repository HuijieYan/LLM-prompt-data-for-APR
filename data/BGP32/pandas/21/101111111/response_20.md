Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the root cause of the issue lies in the `_get_with` function failing to handle the case when a list-like key is passed as an indexer. The current implementation does not treat list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, leading to different behaviors and incorrect handling. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys properly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like key
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other cases
    else:
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the case when the key is a list-like object by using the `loc` function directly to access the data. This modification ensures consistency in how different types of indexers are treated and should resolve the failing tests related to list indexers.

After applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list-like keys and avoid the KeyError that was previously triggered during the failing tests.
