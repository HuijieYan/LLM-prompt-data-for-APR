Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test cases, it appears that the issue stems from the way list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects. The key point of failure is when using a list as the key for indexing, leading to an inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series.Series` class. By treating list indexers similarly to other indexers, we can maintain a consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if not is_extension_array_dtype(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list indexers are treated similarly to other array-like indexers in this function, we address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves consistently across different types of indexers.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
