### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case when a Series object is passed as the key for indexing. The function correctly distinguishes between integer keys and non-integer keys but fails to handle the case where a Series object is used as the key. 

When a Series object is passed as the key, the function attempts to convert it to a list, leading to incorrect behavior. This results in a KeyError when trying to index the Series object with the provided key. The function should handle Series objects as keys differently to prevent this issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle Series objects as keys properly. Rather than converting the key to a list and causing a KeyError, we should handle the indexing differently for Series objects. We can check if the key is a Series object and process it accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        # Handle Series keys differently, extract the values and use them for indexing
        return self.reindex(key.values)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific condition to handle Series objects as keys and extracting their values for indexing, we can avoid the KeyError issue and ensure correct indexing behavior for Series objects.
