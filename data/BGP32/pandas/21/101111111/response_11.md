To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the `key` input is converted to a list but is not recognized as one of the expected types (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index). In this case, we need to convert the key to a list explicitly before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction explicitly converts the `key` input to a list if it is not recognized as one of the expected types, ensuring consistent behavior for different indexer types.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected outputs as described in the runtime and expected values sections.
