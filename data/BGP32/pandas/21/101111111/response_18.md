To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the code to handle list-like indexers consistently. Currently, the function is raising a `KeyError` when using a list-like indexer such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The expected behavior for all these types of indexers should be similar. 

To address this issue and align with the expected behavior, we can modify the code to utilize the `loc` method for all list-like indexers. By doing so, we can ensure that the function behaves consistently regardless of the type of indexer being used.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all list-like indexers consistently using the loc method
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function as shown above, using the `loc` method for all list-like indexers, such as lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series, we ensure a consistent behavior when accessing elements with different indexers. This change should resolve the inconsistency and the `KeyError` issue when using list-like indexers in the failing test cases.
