To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list-like input correctly. Currently, the function is not handling this case properly, leading to a KeyError in the failing test.

The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like input for `key`, and it tries to handle it in a way that does not align with the expected behavior for list indexers. To resolve this issue, we need to update the implementation for list-like inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Treat list-like inputs as list indexers for consistent behavior
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific conditional branch for list-like inputs and treating them as list indexers, we ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

This fix aligns with the expectations of the failing test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `Series` class.
