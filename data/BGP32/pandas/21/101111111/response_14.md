Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies with how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers. The function fails to properly handle list-like indexers, which leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements that are not present in the index.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be updated to handle list-like indexers correctly. We need to ensure that list-like indexers are treated in a consistent manner with other types of indexers to avoid the `KeyError` being raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle list-like indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers and preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.

Once the corrected function is implemented, it should pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects.
