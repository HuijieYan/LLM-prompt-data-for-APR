Based on the analysis provided, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of indexers when they are of list type. The function fails to properly process a list indexer and raises a `KeyError` even though the value should exist in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly by the function. By modifying the conditional statements related to list-like objects, we can address this issue and make the function behave consistently across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                # positional indexing
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                # label-based indexing
                return self.loc[key]

        # handle other cases where key is a list or other indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # handle scalar cases
        return self.loc[key]
```

This updated implementation ensures that list indexers are properly processed and handled similar to other types of indexers. By making these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing test cases and behave consistently with different indexer types.
