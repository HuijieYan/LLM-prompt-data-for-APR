To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of indexers when they are of type `list` in the `_get_with` function. The issue is related to how DataFrame key indexers are handled, leading to a KeyError when using a list-based indexer.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        # Handle scalars with loc for consistent behavior
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to a list if it's not already
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Convert to list to ensure uniform handling
    key = list(key)

    # Determine key type for further processing
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "string":
        # Handle strings with loc for consistent behavior
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Special handling for list indexers to avoid KeyError
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently to avoid KeyError issues. It specifically addresses the problem with list-based indexers by converting them to a list, identifying the key type appropriately, and ensuring consistent behavior when accessing elements from the Series.

After making this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub related to inconsistent behavior across different types of indexers.
