To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in handling list indexers. The issue is that when passing a list as an indexer, the function fails to handle it properly, leading to a KeyError. The corrected version should treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list index
    return self.loc[key]

```

By modifying the function to treat list indexers the same as other array-like indexers, we ensure consistent behavior when accessing elements from the Series. This correction should address the KeyError issue reported in the failing test cases and align with the expected behavior as described in the test conditions.
