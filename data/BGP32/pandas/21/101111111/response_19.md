The issue arises from the different treatment of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, when a list indexer is passed, it throws a `KeyError` due to an inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. We can modify the code to treat list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers in terms of error handling and behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and any(isinstance(item, str) for item in key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now handles list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers by checking if any item in the key is a string when dealing with a list indexer. This ensures that the behavior is aligned for all types of indexers, fixing the inconsistency issue reported in the GitHub bug.
