To address the issue with the `_get_with` function in the provided `Series` class, we need to modify the handling of the key type in the function. The current implementation fails to handle certain key types, leading to inconsistencies in indexing behavior.

By analyzing the runtime input/output values and the expected input/output values from the failing tests, we can identify that the key type is incorrectly determined as `'string'`. This incorrect key type handling is causing the `KeyError` to be raised and the tests to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to correctly handle different key types, especially when indexing with a list. We can modify the logic to ensure all cases are treated consistently, leading to the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle different key types consistently, ensuring that the tests pass and the expected behavior is met. This updated logic eliminates the inconsistencies in indexing behavior associated with different key types, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
