Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in how the function `_get_with` handles different types of key input. The function improperly processes the `key` variable when it is a list-like object, resulting in the KeyError raised in the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the way the function handles list-like key input. Specifically, we should treat list-like key input consistently and ensure correct behavior similar to other types of key inputs.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing tests:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # for consistent behavior, convert key to a list before processing
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle list-like key input, we ensure consistency and correct behavior for various types of key inputs. This corrected version should address the issue reported in the GitHub ticket and pass the failing tests.
