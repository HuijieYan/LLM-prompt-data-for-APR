To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to adjust the handling of different types of indexers. The issue arises when using a list indexer, which leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

The key issue here is that for list indexers, the code currently does not handle the indexing correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`. We need to modify the logic to handle list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we added handling for both "integer" and "string" key types to be treated consistently. Additionally, we adjusted the logic for list indexers to be compatible with other types of indexers.

By applying these changes, the `_get_with` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases.
