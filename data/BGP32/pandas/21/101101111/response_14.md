Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue lies in how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function fails to handle list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access elements that are not present.

The fix involves specifically handling the case of list indexers to ensure consistency and prevent the KeyError. This can be achieved by modifying the code to treat list indexers similarly to how other indexers are treated.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list indexers properly and prevent the KeyError issue that was encountered in the failing test cases. The function now treats list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
