Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, the issue arises from the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function currently does not correctly handle the case when a list indexer is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers. We should ensure that list-like indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now handle list indexers properly and ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers.

After applying this fix, the `test_getitem_no_matches` test cases should pass without raising a `KeyError` due to mismatched behaviors between different types of indexers.
