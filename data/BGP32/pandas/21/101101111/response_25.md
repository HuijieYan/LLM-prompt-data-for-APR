The buggy function `_get_with` is currently causing issues when handling different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function is not treating list indexers the same way it handles other types of indexers such as ndarray, Index, or Series.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of list-like indexers, which leads to a KeyError when trying to access values that do not exist in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle all types of list-like indexers consistently
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that list-like indexers are properly handled using the `self.loc[key]` approach, which addresses the inconsistency and resolves the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub thread.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now handle all indexers consistently, passing the failing test cases provided.
