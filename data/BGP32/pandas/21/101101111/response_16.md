## Fixing the Bug

### Issue:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when dealing with different types of key indexers. In particular, when using a list-like key, the function fails to handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because of inconsistent behavior in handling list-like key indexers within the `_get_with` function. The function does not appropriately handle list indexes, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access values with a list-like key index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like key indexers correctly. We should align the behavior of different types of key indexers to prevent inconsistencies.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if not isinstance(key, Index):
            key = ensure_index(key)
    
        key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing: {}".format(type(key)))
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected function now properly handles list-like key indexers by ensuring that the key is converted to an index if it's not already an instance of an index type.
- If the key is a scalar value and not present in the index, a `KeyError` is raised to indicate that the key is not in the index.
- The function now checks for the key type and routes the indexing behavior accordingly, either through `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type.
- If the key type is not recognized, a `TypeError` is raised to indicate an unsupported key type for indexing.

By implementing these changes, the function now correctly handles different types of key indexers, including list-like keys, and avoids the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests.
