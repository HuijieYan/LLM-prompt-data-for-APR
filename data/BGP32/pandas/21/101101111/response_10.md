## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. The key issue arises when a key of type `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` is used and the method should return a KeyError if no matches are found in the index. However, the current implementation leads to inconsistent behavior for different types of input keys, causing the failing tests.

In the failing test cases, when a key of type `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` is passed, the expected behavior is to return a KeyError if no matches are found in the index. In the current implementation, the key_type is incorrectly inferred as 'string', leading to incorrect behavior. This incorrect inference results in the function not handling the key properly, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Cause
The key issue causing the bug is the incorrect handling of key_type inference. When handling list-like keys, the inferred type should not be 'string', causing the function to not properly differentiate between label-based and positional indexing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when dealing with list-like keys, the `key_type` is correctly inferred to allow proper handling of different types of indexes. This would involve modifying the code segment that determines the `key_type` based on the input key type to correctly identify and handle list-like keys.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for list-like keys, allowing the function to handle different input key types consistently. This corrected version should now pass the failing tests, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
