## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is incorrectly handling the case when the key is a list-like object. This causes inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, leading to failing tests. The issue is related to the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior when trying to access a value in a Series using different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The expected behavior is a KeyError indicating that none of the items in the index are present, regardless of the type of indexer used. However, the actual behavior varies depending on the type of indexer.

The variables `key_type` and the inference of the key type within the `_get_with` function are not correctly handling the case when `key` is a list-like object, which leads to incorrect behavior. This issue needs to be addressed to align the behavior with the expectations outlined in the failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function:
1. Modify the handling of `key` when it is not an array-like object to ensure consistent behavior and raise a KeyError if none of the items in the index match.
2. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key`.
3. Ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) produce the same KeyError when none of the items are found in the index.

By addressing these issues, the corrected version of the function should behave consistently with all types of indexers, passing the failing tests and aligning with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic as described above, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers and pass the failing tests.
