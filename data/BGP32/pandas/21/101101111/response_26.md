## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling indexers of different types such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The issue arises from treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior. Specifically, when using a list key, the function raises a KeyError due to a mismatch in the handling of the index. This inconsistency leads to failing tests and contradicts the expected behavior, as described in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of indexers across different types (list, ndarray, Index, or Series) within the `_get_with` function. By standardizing the approach to handle these indexers, we can align the behavior with the expected output and resolve the failing test cases. The fix involves updating the logic within the function to correctly handle all types of indexers without causing KeyErrors or inconsistencies.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns the handling of indexers across different types:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list if necessary
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the function to correctly handle indexers of different types, ensuring conversion to lists where needed, and providing unified treatment based on index types, we can resolve the bug and pass the failing tests. This updated logic aligns with the expected behaviors and addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
