## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function is not handling the case where the key is an `Index` object correctly. When the key is an `Index`, the variable `key_type` is assigned the inferred type of the key, but then the function does not handle this case properly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when the key is an `Index` object. The `key_type` is correctly inferred, but the subsequent branching logic needs to differentiate the behavior based on the `key_type`. By ensuring that the function handles `Index` objects correctly, we can resolve the issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the `ensure_index` call to handle cases where the key is an `Index` object, and adjusting the logic based on the `key_type`, the corrected version of the function should now correctly handle different types of keys, including `Index` objects. This fix aligns the function's behavior with the expected input/output values and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
