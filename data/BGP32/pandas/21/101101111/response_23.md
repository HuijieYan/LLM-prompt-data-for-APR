## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs due to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series using different types of key inputs such as lists, ndarrays, Index objects, or Series. The issue arises when trying to index with a list, leading to a `KeyError` even though indexing with other types of inputs like ndarrays or Index objects works fine.

In the failing test case, the key is converted into a list (`key = list(key)`) before passing it to the `reindex` function. This conversion causes the key to be treated differently within the `_get_with` function, leading to a `KeyError`.

The issue is related to how the type of the key is processed within the function, specifically in the final section where the key type is determined and whether to use `loc` or `iloc` for indexing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure consistent behavior when dealing with different types of key inputs. We should handle the case when the key is a list similarly to how ndarray or Index objects are handled.

One possible strategy to fix the bug is to treat a list-like key as an Index object internally. By converting the key to an Index object, we can maintain consistency in how different types of keys are processed within the function.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        # Raise an error for DataFrame and handle non-list-like cases
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with non-list-like or DataFrame object"
            " is not supported."
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is a list-like object
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function as shown above, the bug related to inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects should be resolved. The function now appropriately handles different types of key inputs and provides expected behavior in all cases.
