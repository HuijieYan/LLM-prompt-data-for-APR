## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is primarily responsible for handling different types of indexers to retrieve values from a Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` highlights a case where using a list as an indexer results in a `KeyError`, indicating that the behavior is inconsistent compared to using other array-like indexers.

The key issue in the buggy function is how it handles different types of indexers. Specifically, when dealing with a list indexer, the function does not correctly handle it as expected, leading to the `KeyError`. This inconsistency in behavior needs to be addressed to align with the expected behavior and resolve the failing test case.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is encountered, the function fails to process it properly, leading to the `KeyError` instead of retrieving the values correctly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be updated to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. The appropriate logic needs to be applied to process list indexers correctly and retrieve values from the Series without raising a `KeyError`.

## Updated `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This updated version ensures that list indexers are handled correctly, aligning their behavior with other array-like indexers. By making these adjustments, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` should pass as expected.
