## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in how the function handles different types of indexers, especially when the indexer is a list. The function should treat all indexers consistently to avoid the KeyError that occurs with list indexers.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers in a uniform way. We can achieve this by updating the logic to treat all indexers as positional indexers (using `iloc`) if the index is not label-based.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all types of indexers consistently
    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.iloc[key]
```

With this modification, the function will now treat all indexers consistently and use `iloc` for positional indexing. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub discussion regarding the inconsistent behavior of the function based on different indexer types.
