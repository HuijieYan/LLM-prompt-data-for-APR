After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue arises because the function `_get_with` does not handle the case when a list-like key is used to index a Series correctly. The function incorrectly tries to reindex the Series using the key, leading to a KeyError if the key does not match any index values.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function. Instead of blindly attempting to reindex the Series with the key, we should first check if the key values exist in the Series index. If not, we should raise a KeyError similar to how it behaves when using other methods like array-like or Index keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check `if any(k not in self.index for k in key):` before proceeding with reindexing, we ensure that a KeyError is raised when attempting to access values that do not exist in the Series index.

This correction aligns the behavior for list indexers with other types like arrays and Index objects, resolving the issue mentioned in the GitHub post. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
