Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of indexers when accessing a Series. The issue stems from a discrepancy in behavior when using different types of indexers such as arrays, indexes, and lists.

To fix this issue, the `_get_with` function needs to handle all types of indexers consistently and ensure that the return values are as expected based on the input indexers. The function should treat all indexers in a unified manner to avoid discrepancies in behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ('integer', 'floating'):
        if not self.index.is_integer():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the handling of different types of indexers is consistent and aligns with the expected behavior. It addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread by handling all cases uniformly.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to confirm that the bug has been fixed and the expected behavior is now achieved.
