## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. The function incorrectly processes the key based on its type, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests. The expected behavior is to handle list-like keys consistently, regardless of their specific type.

The failing test is designed to highlight the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically lists. The test expects the behavior of indexing with a list to be consistent with indexing using other array-like objects like ndarray or Index, which is not the case in the current implementation.

The runtime values extracted from the failing test executions reveal that the function misclassifies the type of the key in some cases, resulting in incorrect handling and ultimately causing KeyError exceptions.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function performs various checks on the key's type, leading to incorrect classification, which ultimately affects the indexing behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are processed consistently, regardless of their specific type. This can be achieved by updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to treat all list-like keys in the same manner.

## The Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ('string', 'mixed-integer', 'mixed-bool', 'mixed-integer-float'):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

## Summary of Changes
1. Ensured that all list-like keys are handled consistently by removing unnecessary type checks.
2. Modified the key_type checks to include more possible scenarios where the key should be reindexed.
3. Updated the logic to differentiate between cases where positional indexing (iloc) or label-based indexing (loc) should be used based on the index's status.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, resolving the bug and aligning with the expected behavior.
