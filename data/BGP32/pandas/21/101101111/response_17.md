## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers. When the function receives an indexer that is a list, it incorrectly triggers an error because it tries to reindex the Series based on that list. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, leading to the failing test cases.

The failing tests involve passing a key that is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series to the `ser[key]` operation. In the case of a list key, the function incorrectly raises a `KeyError`, stating that none of the elements in the index match the provided key, even though it should treat list-like keys similar to other indexers like ndarray or Index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be adjusted to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. Instead of attempting to reindex the Series with a key that is a list, the function should pass list-like keys directly to the `loc` indexer for appropriate processing.

## Updated `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and allows it to pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Fixed handling of list-like keys
    return self.loc[list(key)]
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle list-like keys by passing them to the `loc` indexer, ensuring consistency with how other types of indexers are processed. The function should now pass the failing test cases successfully.
