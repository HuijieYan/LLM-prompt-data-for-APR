## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series. It should differentiate between different key types like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc., and perform the indexing appropriately.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior when trying to index a Series with various box types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) that do not match any values in the Series index. The test fails with a KeyError where it is expected to return NaN values.

The buggy function incorrectly handles certain key types (e.g., a list key) by not following the expected behavior, leading to inconsistencies in indexing results.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing cases, the key type is list-like, and the function should handle such cases properly by falling back to positional indexing using `self.iloc[key]`. However, due to the buggy implementation, the function returns `self.loc[key]` when encountering a list key type, leading to a KeyError because the key does not match the index.

The key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` regardless of the actual key type, causing the function to choose the wrong path for indexing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify list-like keys and ensure that the function handles them appropriately for indexing. We should adjust the logic to use `self.iloc[key]` instead of `self.loc[key]` for such cases. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `key_type` variable accurately reflects the type of the key to guide the indexing process correctly.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]  # Use iloc instead of loc for list keys

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will handle list keys appropriately by using `self.iloc[key]` for positional indexing, ensuring consistency in behavior for different key types.
