## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle cases where the key is a list-like object. The function is designed to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other types, but it doesn't effectively address list-like keys.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of indexing with a list-like object, where the expected behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. However, the current implementation of `_get_with` is causing inconsistencies and raising a `KeyError` when a list-like key is passed.

The buggy function neglects to handle list-like keys correctly, leading to the failure of the test cases. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we should modify the logic to handle list-like keys properly. We need to ensure that list-like keys are processed in a consistent manner with other types of indexers to avoid the `KeyError` exception.

One approach to fix the bug is to update the logic within the function to handle list-like keys appropriately. By making adjustments to how list-like keys are processed, we can ensure that the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers.

## The Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to properly handle list-like keys and consider them as a valid type of indexer, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and exhibit consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
