The buggy function `_get_with` is failing for cases where a list-like key is provided to index the Series. The function fails to handle the list-like key correctly and ends up not returning the expected result, causing the failing tests.

The issue arises from how the function tries to process different types of keys. It incorrectly treats list-like keys differently from other types, leading to inconsistencies in behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys consistently with other types of keys when indexing the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that all types of keys are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function, allowing it to properly handle list-like keys and resolve the issues highlighted in the failing tests.
