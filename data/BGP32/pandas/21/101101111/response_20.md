Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function and the expected values during the failing test execution, the issue lies in how the buggy function handles different types of indexers. The list indexer case is causing the KeyError due to inconsistency in handling compared to other types of indexers.

The bug occurs when the key is a list, and it is not properly processed in the `_get_with` function, leading to the KeyError in the failing test scenario.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers to align it with other indexer types in the code block. This will ensure consistency and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the list indexer case similar to other indexer types, such as np.ndarray, to prevent the KeyError from occurring in the failing test scenario.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now work correctly and pass the failing test cases, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
