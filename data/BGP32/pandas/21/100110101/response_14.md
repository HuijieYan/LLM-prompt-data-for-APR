### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs when indexing a Series. However, there are several issues in the function causing it to fail with a KeyError in the provided test cases.

1. When the key is a list or ndarray containing a single element, the function fails to correctly infer the data type of the key.
2. Incorrectly handling the key when it is a Series.
3. Inadequate handling of unique edge cases like `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)`.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test case, the key is constructed as `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`. The function fails to properly handle this input by not recognizing it as a string key. This leads to the KeyError being raised, as the key `'C'` is not found in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify the type of the key input before processing it.
2. Ensure proper handling of all key input types including lists, ndarrays, Series, and Index objects.
3. Update the logic to correctly infer the data type of the key.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying the fix above, the corrected function should now properly handle the different key input types and pass the failing test cases while returning the expected output values.
