Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the main issue lies in the handling of the key parameter in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly dealing with different types of inputs, such as lists, ndarrays, and Index objects. This inconsistency leads to the KeyError in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the function handles different types of input key values to ensure that all types are correctly processed. We can modify the function to consider the input type of key and perform the appropriate operations accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should properly handle different types of input keys and avoid the KeyError in the failing test. The function now considers the input type of key and adjusts the behavior accordingly.
