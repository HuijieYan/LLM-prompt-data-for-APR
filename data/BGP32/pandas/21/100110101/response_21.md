## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys during indexing. The function checks the type of the key provided for indexing and attempts to determine the type of the key before performing the indexing operation. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and performs the indexing operation accordingly. The function should handle different types of keys such as lists, arrays, indexes, and Series appropriately.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(
            "Unsupported key type. Expected types: slice, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index"
        )
```

By updating the conditional statements and the flow of the function, we can handle different key types appropriately and perform the indexing operation based on the type of the key provided. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
