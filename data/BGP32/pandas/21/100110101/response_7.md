## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. 
1. It checks if the key is a slice and calls `_convert_slice_indexer` method.
2. It checks if the key is an `ABCDataFrame` and raises a `TypeError`.
3. It checks if the key is a tuple and calls `_get_values_tuple` method.
4. If the key is not a list-like object, it tries to index using `self.loc[key]`.
5. It checks the type of the key and based on that either uses `self.loc[key]` or `self.iloc[key]`.
6. Finally, it handles cases where the key is a list or reindexes the Series.

The failing test is trying to index the Series with a key that does not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.

## Bug
The bug occurs when checking if the key type is `'integer'`. The current implementation is not handling the case when `key` is a list-like object, specifically when `key` is an instance of `Index`. This leads to unexpected behavior and the KeyError is not raised as expected in the test.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of the key type `'integer'` in the `_get_with` function. We should check if `key` is an instance of `Index` separately and treat it as a list-like object. This will ensure that the correct branch of code is executed for `Index` instances.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making sure that `key` of type `Index` is converted to a list before determining its `key_type`, we can handle the case properly and ensure the correct behavior when indexing the Series.
