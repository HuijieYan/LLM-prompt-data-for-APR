Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the issue arises when the key parameter is not recognized as list-like, leading to an incorrect handling of the indexing operation. The key_type should be determined correctly based on the type of key input, and the appropriate indexing method (iloc or loc) should be used accordingly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is processed correctly based on its type. We should handle different types of key inputs with specific logic for each case.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        key = [key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing")

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the duplicate indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this correction, we first check if the key is list-like or scalar. If it is a scalar, we convert it to a list for consistent handling. We then determine the key_type based on the processed key and switch between `loc` and `iloc` methods accordingly for integer keys. Finally, we handle the case of a list key for indexing.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test cases, ensuring that the function behaves correctly for different types of key inputs.
