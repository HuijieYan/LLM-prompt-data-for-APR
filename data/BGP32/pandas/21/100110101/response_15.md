## Analysis
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The bug in the function lies in the way it handles non-list-like keys. When a non-list-like key is provided, the function tries to access the `self.loc[key]`. However, this can lead to a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

## Error
The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when accessing `self.loc[key]` with a non-list-like key that is not found in the index. This results in the failing test not catching the expected KeyError when indexing a Series with a key that is not in the index.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to change the way non-list-like keys are handled. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we can check if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it. This way, we can avoid the KeyError and handle non-list-like keys more gracefully.

## Correction
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        found_key = self.index.get_indexer([key])
        if any(found_key == -1):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `self.index.get_indexer([key])`, we can check if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it with `self.loc[key]`. This approach will prevent the KeyError when indexing a Series with a key that is not in the index.
