Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and failing test, the bug seems to be related to the handling of the input key parameter. The function is not properly handling different types of input keys, leading to a KeyError in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of input keys, such as lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series. Additionally, we need to correctly determine the type of the key parameter and handle it accordingly to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as shown above, it should now properly handle different types of input keys and avoid the KeyError that was occurring in the failing test cases. The function should now pass the failing tests and satisfy the expected input/output variable values.
