## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the core issue lies in the handling of different types of keys and the inference of key types. The function is not properly handling the case where the key is a list-like object, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling key types. Specifically, when the key is list-like, we should treat it differently in order to avoid the KeyError. We can achieve this by explicitly checking if the key is list-like and accessing the elements accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking if `key` is list-like before accessing elements, we avoid the KeyError that was occurring in the failing test. This corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and correctly handle different types of keys.
