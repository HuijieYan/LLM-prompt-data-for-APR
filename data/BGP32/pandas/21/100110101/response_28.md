Based on the analysis, the bug appears to be related to handling non-list-like keys, such as ndarray or Index types. The function incorrectly assumes that the key could be converted to a list, leading to an error when indexing the series.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for non-list-like keys and avoid converting them to a list. We can handle these cases separately based on the type of the key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction includes a check for scalar keys before attempting to index with `loc`. It also removes the unnecessary conversion of non-list-like keys to a list, ensuring proper handling of different key types. 

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
