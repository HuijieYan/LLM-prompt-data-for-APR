### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys passed for indexing. The bug seems to arise when a `list` key is passed, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of keys.

### Identifying potential error locations:
- The issue could be related to how the function handles a `list` key compared to other types of keys.
- The specific check for `is_list_like(key)` might be causing the problem.
- The error could be related to the `_convert_slice_indexer` method or the `reindex` method when handling a `list` key.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs when trying to index a `Series` with a `list` key. The expected behavior is for the function to raise a `KeyError` if none of the items in the `list` key are found in the index. However, due to the inconsistency in handling different types of keys, the `KeyError` is not raised for the `list` key, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the handling of a `list` key is consistent with how other types of keys are handled. This may involve aligning the behavior of indexing for `list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, str):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, (tuple, list)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By aligning the behavior for different types of keys, specifically ensuring that a `list` key behaves consistently in terms of raising a `KeyError` if no match is found, the bug can be fixed in the `_get_with` function. This correction should resolve the issue regarding inconsistent behavior when indexing with a `list` key.
