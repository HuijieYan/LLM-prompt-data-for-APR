### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, arrays, etc.
- The bug occurs when trying to index a Series using a list key, causing a KeyError to be raised but not as expected.
- The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the behavior of indexing using a list key differs from other types of keys, which is inconsistent.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling indexers of different types and questions the rationale behind it, proposing a change to make the behavior consistent.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- When indexing a Series with a list key, the function incorrectly raises a KeyError instead of returning NaN values for the non-matching index.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers in the Series class.
- Ensure that when a list key is provided, NaN values are returned for non-matching indexes instead of raising a KeyError.

class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    """
    One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).
    
    Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object
    supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of
    methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical
    methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude
    missing data (currently represented as NaN).
    
    Operations between Series (+, -, /, *, **) align values based on their
    associated index values-- they need not be the same length. The result
    index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, Iterable, dict, or scalar value
        Contains data stored in Series.
    
        .. versionchanged:: 0.23.0
           If data is a dict, argument order is maintained for Python 3.6
           and later.
    
    index : array-like or Index (1d)
        Values must be hashable and have the same length as `data`.
        Non-unique index values are allowed. Will default to
        RangeIndex (0, 1, 2, ..., n) if not provided. If both a dict and index
        sequence are used, the index will override the keys found in the
        dict.
    dtype : str, numpy.dtype, or ExtensionDtype, optional
        Data type for the output Series. If not specified, this will be
        inferred from `data`.
        See the :ref:`user guide <basics.dtypes>` for more usages.
    name : str, optional
        The name to give to the Series.
    copy : bool, default False
        Copy input data.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers in the Series class, resolving the KeyError issue when indexing with a list key.
