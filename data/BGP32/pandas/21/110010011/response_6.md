### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method within the `Series` class of the pandas library.
2. The error message is related to KeyError and the failing test is testing the behavior of indexing with different types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`).
3. The bug seems to be in the handling of list-like indexes and how they are being processed within the function.
4. The bug causes inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`).
5. Based on the GitHub issue, the expectation is to have consistent behavior across these different indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the conditional check for list-like indexes:
  - When the key is a list-like index, it directly tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which raises a KeyError instead of handling it correctly.

### Solution Strategy:
- It's important to distinguish between different types of indexers in order to handle them appropriately.
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexes are processed correctly within the `_get_with` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = key._values
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key._values
    elif isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key = key._values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "mixed":
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation:
- The corrected version handles cases where the `key` is not list-like or is a string by converting it into a list.
- It then checks the type of the `key` and appropriately retrieves the values based on whether it's a Series, Index, or ExtensionArray.
- This corrected version ensures that list-like indexes are processed correctly and consistent behavior is maintained across different types of indexers.
