### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of input keys to retrieve values from a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of input keys, specifically when the key is in list-like form.
3. The error message indicates that the bug occurs when indexing a Series with a list, which leads to a `KeyError` when the item is not found in the index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers, pointing out the different results obtained with the same key when using different types.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers behave consistently with other array-like indexers.
 
### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling list-like keys. The function incorrectly processes list-like keys, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to index the Series. This inconsistency causes issues when indexing with lists compared to other array-like indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. We should make the behavior of indexing with list-like keys match the behavior produced by other array-like keys, such as numpy arrays, pandas Index objects, and pandas Series objects.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]  # Use loc for array-like indexers
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)  # Reindex for list-like keys
```

By making a consistent handling of all types of indexers, including list-like ones, the corrected function ensures that the behavior aligns with the expectations of handling different key types uniformly.
