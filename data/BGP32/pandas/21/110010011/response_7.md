### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values in the Series object.
2. The failing test is trying to index the Series object using different types of indexer data structures (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series). The test is expecting an error message related to missing keys in the index when providing an indexer with no matches.
3. The error occurs specifically when using a list as an indexer. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior of the `ser[list(key)]` case should be consistent with the behavior when using other types of indexers.
5. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function that leads to a KeyError when no matches are found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly and produce the same behavior as when using other types of indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. This will involve modifying the part of the function that deals with list-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]  # Convert single key to list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` to directly return `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys, we ensure that list-like indexers will be handled correctly in the case where no matches are found, consistent with other types of indexers. This modification addresses the bug reported in the failing test and aligns with the suggested fix in the GitHub issue.
