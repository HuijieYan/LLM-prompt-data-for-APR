### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used in the `Series` class to handle different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The error in the function occurs when `key` is a list-like object. This error is related to an inconsistency in the behavior of indexers between different types.
3. The error message states that the expected behavior for multiple indexer types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) should be the same. However, when using a list-like `key`, it raises a `KeyError` due to the mismatch between different types of indexers.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when `key` is list-like.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. When `key` is list-like, the function should treat all indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) the same way. However, the issue in the current implementation is causing a `KeyError` when a list indexer is used.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function consistently handles list-like indexers for all indexer types. By modifying the function to treat list-like `key` in a uniform manner for Index, Series, ndarray, and list cases, the issue can be resolved.

### Corrected Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should resolve the bug:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers uniformly
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index if needed

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that all types of indexers are handled consistently for list-like `key`, the corrected function should pass the failing test case and resolve the inconsistency issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
