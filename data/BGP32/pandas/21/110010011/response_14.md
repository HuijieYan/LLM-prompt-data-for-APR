### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the bug

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from the pandas library is responsible for retrieving values based on different types of keys/indexers. The bug occurs when passing a list as the key/indexer, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects. This bug is related to GitHub issue #5880, where the inconsistency in handling list indexers is discussed.

### Potential error locations within the `_get_with` function
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` might not correctly handle scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.
2. The block handling a key of type `list` can lead to the bug, as it directly attempts to use `self.loc[key]`.
3. The check for `isinstance(key, list)` could be problematic in this context.
4. The return statement for handling a key of type `list` may not be appropriate.
5. The final `else` block returning `self.reindex(key)` could have unforeseen consequences for lists.

### Cause of the bug using the buggy function, docs, error message, GitHub Issue
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The error message indicates that when passing a list as the key, a `KeyError` is raised due to mismatched index values. This inconsistency is discussed in the GitHub issue, where the behavior for list indexers differs from array-like indexers. The bug is related to the direct use of the key with `self.loc[key]` inside the condition checking for a key of type `list`, causing the mismatch in handling.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other indexers like arrays or Index objects. This can be achieved by appropriately handling the key when it is of type `list`. It may involve a different approach than what is currently used with `self.loc[key]`.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # Always convert key to list in order to have consistent handling
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Always treat list indexing by reindexing
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly convert the key to a list when needed, ensuring consistent handling for all types of indexers. Additionally, we handle list indexers by reindexing to maintain the required consistency and address the bug reported in the GitHub issue. This corrected version should resolve the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers with the `Series` class in pandas.
