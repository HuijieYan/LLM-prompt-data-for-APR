### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The conditional check for `is_list_like(key)` may not correctly handle list indexers.
2. The logic to handle different types of indexers such as `Index`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, and `Series` may be causing the issue.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When a `list` indexer is used, it triggers an error stating that none of the items in the index are present, while other types like `np.array` and `Index` do not exhibit this behavior. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers leads to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) are handled consistently. Therefore, we need to review the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers properly and ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "mixed-integer"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
    return self._slice(slobj)
```

With this corrected version, the function ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
