### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys when accessing elements in a Series object.
2. The error message indicates that the code is not handling the case when a list-like key is provided, resulting in a `KeyError` because the element is not found in the index.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when accessing elements with list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by `_get_with` function not correctly handling list-like keys. When a list-like key is provided, the function tries to access the element directly without converting it properly, resulting in a `KeyError` if the element is not in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of the key provided and appropriately convert it to ensure it matches the index type.
2. Modify the code to handle list-like keys correctly by converting them to a format that matches the index.
3. Update the logic to handle different types of keys consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key = ensure_index(key)
        else:
            key = [key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the key is list-like and convert it to an index using the `ensure_index` function. This ensures that list-like keys are processed correctly and match the index type, resolving the KeyError issue.
