### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a problem when indexing with a list-like object, causing a `KeyError`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between indexing with different types of objects, specifically lists.
4. The bug seems to be related to how lists are handled differently compared to other index-like objects.
5. The current implementation is not handling the key being a list correctly, leading to an error.

### Bug Cause:
1. Currently, the `_get_with(key)` function in the Series class doesn't handle list-like keys correctly.
2. When a list key is provided, the code doesn't process it properly, leading to incorrect behavior and raising a `KeyError`.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of objects.
2. The code should be modified to handle list-like keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):  # Modified this condition
        key = list(key)  # Ensure key is converted to a list
        # handle the case of a list index
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Handle cases where key format is unknown
    raise TypeError(f"Unrecognized key format for indexing: {key}")
```

### Summary:
1. The corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function ensures that list-like keys are handled appropriately without causing a `KeyError`.
2. By modifying the function to treat list indexers consistently with other types, we ensure a more robust and predictable behavior while indexing Series objects.
