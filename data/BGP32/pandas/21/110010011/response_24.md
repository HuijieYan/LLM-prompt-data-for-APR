### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs in a Series object.
- The failing test is trying to index a Series object with a key that does not exist in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The error messages indicate that the issue arises when attempting to index with a list, an array, and a Series.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior for different types of indexers (list, array-like, Series).
  
### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-like keys.
2. Inconsistent behavior for different key types.
3. Error in determining the correct type of key for indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The `elif not is_list_like(key):` branch of the code tries to index the Series directly with the key if the key is not list-like. This approach causes an error when the key doesn't exist in the index. The error message is consistent with this behavior based on the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic to handle list-like keys appropriately to avoid the `KeyError`.
- Ensure consistency in behavior for different key types while indexing.
- Determine the correct type of key for indexing by inspecting the input key type. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_arr = np.asarray(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or not np.all(ensure_platform_int(key_arr) == key_arr):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(ensure_index(key))

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "atomic" or key_type == "boolean":
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() and key_type not in ["float", "integer"]:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
- The key is converted into an array to ensure consistency.
- The logic for handling the list-like keys has been updated to prevent `KeyError`.
- The function now determines the correct type of key based on the input key type and uses it for indexing, ensuring consistency.
- The key is ensured to be an index object before proceeding with indexing.
