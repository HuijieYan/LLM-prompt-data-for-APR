### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a `Series`.
2. The failing test is trying to index a `Series` with a key that has no matches in the `Series` index, which should raise a `KeyError`.
3. The bug is related to how the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a `Series` with different types of indexers.
   
### Identified potential error locations:
1. The bug may be related to how list-like indexers are processed differently from other indexers.
2. The bug could be in the logic that differentiates the types of indexers and how they are handled.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function is treating list indexers differently from other indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior when trying to access values that do not exist in the index. This inconsistency violates the expected behavior and causes the failing tests.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to treat all types of indexers in a consistent manner. Specifically, the handling of list-like indexers should be modified to align with the behavior of other indexers, ensuring that a `KeyError` is raised when accessing values that do not exist in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    keys = list(key)

    if not is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[keys]

    # Here we ensure behavior consistency for all indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {self.index[key].values} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = np.array(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the logic is updated to treat all types of indexers consistently, especially when validating that the key values exist in the index. This change aims to align the behavior of the function with the expected results, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report and passing the failing test cases.
