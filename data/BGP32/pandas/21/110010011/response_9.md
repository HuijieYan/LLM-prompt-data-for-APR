### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of indexers used with a Series.
- The error occurs when passing a Series instance as an indexer to the `ser[]` operation and expecting a `KeyError` to be raised if no matches are found.
- The failing test cases are checking this behavior with different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
- The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers, which can lead to unexpected results and errors.

### Potential error locations:
- The bug may be related to how the function handles different types of indexers and how it interacts with the index of the Series.
- The bug may be in the logic that checks the type of the indexer and decides on the appropriate action to take based on the type.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not appropriately handle the case when a Series instance is used as an indexer. The current logic does not differentiate between different types of indexers in a consistent manner, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that Series instances are handled consistently with other types of indexers.
- Specifically, we should ensure that if a Series instance is used as an indexer and no matches are found, a `KeyError` should be raised to maintain consistency with other types of indexers.
- We should update the logic to handle list-like indexers in a similar way to other types, addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle Series instance used as indexer
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the suggested modifications in the corrected version above, we address the issue with inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series instance, ensuring that the Series instance is handled consistently with other types. This corrected version should resolve the failing test and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
