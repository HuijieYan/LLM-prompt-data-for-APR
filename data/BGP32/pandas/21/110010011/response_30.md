### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing an issue when indexing a `Series` object with a list-like key, resulting in a `KeyError` exception not being raised as expected. This inconsistency was highlighted in GitHub issue #5880.
2. The potential error locations in the function include the condition where the key is not list-like, and the final `return self.reindex(key)` statement.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the failure to handle list-like keys as expected within the `_get_with` function. The function incorrectly proceeds to the `reindex` method when encountering a list key, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions related to list-like keys and ensure that the key is treated correctly within the function.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            idx = self.index.intersection(key)
            if idx.empty:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
            return self.loc[idx]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by handling list-like keys separately and ensuring that a `KeyError` is raised if none of the keys are found in the index, providing consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
