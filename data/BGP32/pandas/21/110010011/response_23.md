### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: _get_with(self, key)
- **Buggy Class**: Series
- **Error Message**: KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"
- **GitHub Issue**: API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling different types of key inputs incorrectly.
2. Incorrect use of `loc` and `reindex` methods.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of how different types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) are handled in the `_get_with` function. The specific problem arises when using a list as an indexer. The error occurs because the `_get_with` function does not properly handle the list index and leads to a KeyError as it fails to find the elements in the series index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers.
2. Implement proper checks and conversions for each type of key input to avoid errors.
3. Use appropriate methods like `loc` and `reindex` to access and reindex the data in the series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Handle different types of indexers
        if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            key = list(key)
        elif isinstance(key, pd.Index) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
            key = key.tolist()
        
        if key == []:
            raise IndexError("None of the values in the provided indexer are in the Series index")
        
        return self.isin(key)
    
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
1. Proper handling of list-like key inputs is implemented.
2. Conversions are made to ensure consistent behavior.
3. Error handling is improved to avoid KeyError when no matches are found.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
