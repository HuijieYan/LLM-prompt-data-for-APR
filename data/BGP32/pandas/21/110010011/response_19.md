### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs when indexing a `Series` object.
- The error occurs when trying to attain the behavior of the key by recognizing its type and executing the respective operation.
- The key types being checked in the function do not cover all possible input scenarios, leading to incorrect behavior and raising errors.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs due to the inconsistent behavior of indexing with different types of keys - specifically, `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`.
- The buggy function did not handle the case where the key is a list properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the series element.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles all types of keys according to the expected behavior.
- We should specifically address the handling of a list key input to prevent the incorrect behavior that leads to a `KeyError`.
- Update the logic to correctly interpret the type of the key input and execute the appropriate operation for each type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "datetimelike"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like key inputs and should resolve the `KeyError` issue when indexing a `Series` object with a list as the key. This update ensures consistent behavior across different types of keys, addressing the bug highlighted in the failing test cases.
