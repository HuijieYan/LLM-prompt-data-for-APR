### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of input keys for indexing a Series object, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and more.
- The reported GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently compared to array-like indexers in the context of accessing elements from a Series.
- The failing test cases provided expose the issue by showing that using a list as an indexer results in a KeyError, while using other types like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series does not result in an error.

### Error Location:
- The bug is likely occurring in the section of the code where the type of the `key` parameter is being checked and handled.
- Specifically, the conditional block that processes non-list-like keys may be problematic in handling the different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises because when a list-like key is passed to the `_get_with` function, the code path followed for processing it doesn't match the handling of other indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.
- The inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers lead to a KeyError when a list-like key is passed, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. This involves updating the conditional logic to handle list-like keys properly.
- We should align the treatment of list-like keys with the handling of other array-like indexers to maintain consistency and prevent errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the code as shown above, the bug related to inconsistent handling of list-like indexers should be resolved and the failing tests are expected to pass successfully. This correction ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function.
