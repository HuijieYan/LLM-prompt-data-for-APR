### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers, including slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, series, and indexes.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that when using a list as an indexer, the function fails to handle it correctly and raises a `KeyError`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that the behavior of the function is inconsistent when using different types of indexers, specifically highlighting the case of a list causing an issue.
4. The current implementation of the function is not handling list indexers correctly, which is causing the failing tests and inconsistency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `_get_with` function handles list indexers properly. This involves updating the logic for list indexers to align with the expected behavior. We should ensure that the function can correctly process a list indexer without raising a `KeyError`. By addressing this issue, we can achieve consistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the fix applied:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Check for empty list
        if not key:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        # Handle the case of key being a list
        key = np.asarray(key)
        if key.ndim > 1:
            raise ValueError("Cannot use a multi-dimensional list as an indexer")
        if is_bool(key):
            key = np.asarray(key)
        return self._get_values(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic for list indexers to convert them to a numpy array and ensuring that an empty list raises a `KeyError`, the corrected `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
