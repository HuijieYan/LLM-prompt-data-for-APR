### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that when passing a list index as the key, it is not behaving consistently with other types of indexes such as np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.
3. The code contains conditional checks to determine the type of key passed for indexing and handle it accordingly. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys.
4. The bug causes inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a list, leading to a KeyError when it should behave similarly to other types of indexers.
5. The bug is likely causing the function to fall back to `self.loc[key]`, which is incorrect for list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional check for list-like keys and the subsequent operation of falling back to `self.loc[key]`. This behavior should be consistent with other types of indexers like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys to match the behavior of other types of indexers and avoid falling back to `self.loc[key]`. Instead, the bug should be fixed by returning an appropriate response for list-like keys that align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list-like keys by converting them to a list if needed and then returning the appropriate result based on the type of key passed. This fix aligns the behavior for list-like keys with other types of indexers and should resolve the inconsistency issue.
