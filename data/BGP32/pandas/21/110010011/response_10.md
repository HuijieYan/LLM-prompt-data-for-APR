### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is causing issues with indexing when a list-like object is used as a key.
2. The error messages indicate that there is discrepancy in handling indexers between `Index`, `Series`, `list`, and other array-like objects in the `ser[key]` operation, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers and suggests aligning the behavior to match the `list` case.
4. The bug arises from handling of different types of indexers inside the `_get_with` function, leading to incorrect behavior when a list is passed as a key.
5. To fix the bug, we can adjust the conditional logic inside the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer being used as a key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional logic to treat all types of indexers in a consistent way when received as a key in the `_get_with` function.
2. Ensure that the key is handled correctly for operations like `ser[key]` to avoid the `KeyError` when an indexer does not match any data in the Series.
3. Adjust the behavior to align with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle key for all other cases consistently
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Ensure list-like keys are converted to list
        key = list(key)

        # Handle the case where none of the keys are found in the index
        if not set(key).issubset(self.index):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that all indexers, including lists, arrays, Series, and Index objects, are handled consistently, preventing the occurrence of a `KeyError` when an indexer does not match any data in the Series. The logic is adjusted to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
