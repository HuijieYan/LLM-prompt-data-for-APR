### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
- The function checks the type of the key input and takes corresponding actions, but there is inconsistency in how it handles different types of key inputs.
- The failing test cases are focusing on the behavior when indexing a Series using a list, array, Index, or Series.
- The error message indicates a KeyError being raised, implying that the key used for indexing is not found in the Series index.
- The GitHub issue points out that there is inconsistency in how different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index, Series) are handled, specifically when the key is not found in the index.
- The issue highlights that indexing with a list should behave consistently with other indexers and that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all 4 types of indexers.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the way it handles the case when the key input is of type list. 
- When the key is a list, it is currently trying to locate the key directly in the Series using `self.loc[key]`.
- If the key is not present in the index of the Series, a KeyError is raised, contrary to the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify how a list-type key is handled in the `_get_with` function.
- When the key is of type list, we should aim to handle it consistently with other indexers by checking for missing keys and potentially raising a KeyError if needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Check and raise KeyError if any key is missing
        missing_keys = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
        if missing_keys:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{missing_keys}] are in the [index]")
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
- Added a check when the key is of type list to find missing keys in the input key list compared to the Series index.
- If any key is missing, raise a KeyError explaining which keys are not found in the Series index.

By making this change, the corrected function should handle the indexing with a list input in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError issue highlighted in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
