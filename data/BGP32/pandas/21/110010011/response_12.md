### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of index keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like keys.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that there is inconsistent behavior when indexing a `Series` with a list-like key compared to other types of keys. The issue on GitHub further highlights the inconsistency in handling different indexers.
3. The bug causes the `ser[key]` operation to fail when `key` is a list of values, resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of index keys, especially when using list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of index keys in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is used, it fails to handle it properly, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Suggested Fix:
To resolve the bug, we should update the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of index keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, dict):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other types of index keys, resolving the `KeyError` when indexing with a list.
