### Analyzing the buggy function:

1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The error message is related to indexing a `Series` with different types of indexers (`list`, `numpy array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`).
3. The bug seems to be in the handling of the indexer `ser[list(key)]` where it raises a `KeyError` due to not behaving consistently with other cases.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a `Series` with different types of indexers and proposes a more consistent approach.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The problematic block seems to be the conditional check for `not is_list_like(key)`, which may not cover all cases correctly.
2. The conversion of `key` to a list is done regardless of its type, which might lead to incorrect behavior when interacting with different types of indexers.

### Explanation of the Bug:
1. The bug stems from the function not handling the case where indexing is done using a `list` indexer (`ser[list(key)]`).
2. In this specific case, the function fails to locate the items in the `index` which leads to a `KeyError`.
3. The inconsistency arises from not treating all types of indexers the same, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle `list` indexers appropriately and consistently with other types of indexers.
2. Avoid converting `key` to a list if it's already of type `Index`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
1. The corrected version handles `Index`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, and `Series` indexers along with `list` indexers more consistently.
2. It avoids converting `key` to a list if it's already a supported type, ensuring correct behavior in the indexing process.
3. This corrected version should resolve the `KeyError` when using `list` indexers and align the behavior with other types of indexers.
