The issue here is that the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access values that are not in the index.

The bug arises due to the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated. When a list-like indexer is passed, it should behave consistently like other indexers such as numpy array or pandas Index. The `_get_with` function fails to handle list-like indexers properly and results in the `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. Specifically, when encountering a list-like indexer, it should be treated similar to numpy array or pandas Index to prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Ensure handling list-like indexers consistently with numpy array or pandas Index
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments as described above, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexers and pass the failing test cases.
