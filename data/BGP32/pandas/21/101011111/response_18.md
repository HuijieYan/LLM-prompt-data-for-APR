To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to make sure that when a Series is indexed using a list-like key, it behaves consistently regardless of the type of indexer. Currently, the bug occurs when a list-like key is used to index the Series, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers. 

The issue arises due to the different internal processing for list-like indexers versus other types like arrays or indexes. The function should handle list-like keys in a way that aligns with the behavior of other indexers to ensure consistency and prevent errors like the `KeyError` being raised in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)  # Convert key to list for consistent handling
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Handle list-like keys consistently
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle duplicate indexing case
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this correction, the function now treats list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring the expected behavior and resolving the issue reported in the failing tests. This fix addresses the inconsistency in how list-like keys are processed, aligning it with the behavior of other indexers when accessing a Series.
