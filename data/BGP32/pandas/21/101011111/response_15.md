## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class within the `pandas` library. In this function, there are different cases that handle how to extract values based on the type of `key` provided. The bug arises when a list-like key is passed into the function. The function does not handle list-like keys properly, leading to a `KeyError` during indexing.

When a list-like `key` is passed, the function attempts to infer the type of the key and process it accordingly. However, this logic fails in the current implementation. This results in an incorrect inference of the key type, leading to the wrong indexing approach and ultimately causing the `KeyError` in the failing test cases.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function should properly identify the type of the key and apply the appropriate indexing method to retrieve the desired values without causing a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle list-like keys and infer their type, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases without raising a `KeyError`.
