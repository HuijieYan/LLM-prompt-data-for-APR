The bug in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class is causing the failing tests. The issue arises from the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer which leads to an inconsistency.

The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to the `ser[key]` operation, causing a `KeyError` to be raised, even though it should ideally behave in the same way as other array-like indexers.

To fix this bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to appropriately handle the case of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that list indexers are treated the same way as other array-like indexers to maintain consistency.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when a list-like indexer is passed, it will be handled similarly to other array-like indexers, maintaining consistency across different types of indexers. The correction should now make the function behave as expected and pass the failing tests.
