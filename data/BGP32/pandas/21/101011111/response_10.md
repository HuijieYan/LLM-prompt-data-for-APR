### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs when trying to access a Series element using an index parameter that is converted to a list. Different ways of creating this index (list, ndarray, Index) lead to inconsistent behavior, where the list index results in a `KeyError`, while other index types do not. This discrepancy is highlighted by the test cases failing.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The key issue seems to be with how the list index is handled compared to other types. We should aim to have all index types handled the same way to prevent the `KeyError` during access.

### Updated Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to list for consistent handling
    key = list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Always handle list type index to prevent KeyError
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers, including lists, are handled consistently to address the inconsistency issue highlighted in the failing test cases.
