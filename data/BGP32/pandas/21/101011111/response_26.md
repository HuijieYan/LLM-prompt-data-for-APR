The issue causing the failing tests is related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. When a list-like key is passed, it encounters an issue where it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected result.

The buggy function is treating list indexers differently from other indexers, leading to a `KeyError` being raised when accessing the Series with a list-like key. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other indexers like ndarray or Index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like keys to align with the behavior of other indexers and ensure that it returns the expected output instead of raising a `KeyError`.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this modification, the `_get_with` function will handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other indexers, ensuring that the correct output is returned.

This correction should resolve the `KeyError` issues in the failing tests and align the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers in the pandas `Series` class.
