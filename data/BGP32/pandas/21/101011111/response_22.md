## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a list-like key (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). The function `_get_with` correctly handles different types of keys in the beginning but fails to properly process a list-like key.

Based on the description and test cases provided, the issue stems from the handling of key types in the function. It successfully identifies and processes various key types like slices, DataFrames, and tuples, but encounters issues with list-like keys.

The function should consider and handle list-like keys similarly to other key types to maintain consistency in indexing behavior. The bug leads to an inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with list-like keys, causing a KeyError in certain cases, as indicated by the failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To address the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function so that it appropriately handles list-like keys. By making adjustments to the key type checks and the indexing branches, we can ensure consistent behavior and prevent KeyError exceptions when using list-like keys.

The bug can be fixed by updating the key type checks for list-like keys and implementing the necessary indexing logic to handle them effectively, ensuring they are correctly processed similar to other key types.

## Corrected Code

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list if not already
    
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- List-like keys are properly identified and converted to a list if necessary.
- The key_type inference is adjusted to handle list-like keys correctly.
- The indexing logic for list-like keys is aligned with the behavior for other key types, ensuring consistency when indexing a Series.

By incorporating these changes, the function should now handle list-like keys without encountering the KeyError issue, passing the failing test cases and resolving the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
