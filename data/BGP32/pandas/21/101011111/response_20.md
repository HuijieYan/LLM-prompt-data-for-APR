To address the issue described in the GitHub report and fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure uniform behavior for different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, Index, and Series. Therefore, we should modify the code to handle all types of indexers consistently.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.array
        return self.loc[key]
    elif (
        isinstance(key, list)
        and not any(isinstance(k, (bool, np.bool_)) for k in key)
    ):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version:
- We directly return `self.loc[key]` for `ABCDataFrame`, `Index`, and `np.ndarray` types since they can be used directly for location-based indexing.
- For `Series`, we convert `key` to the underlying array and then use `loc` for indexing.
- We handle the case for a list by ensuring it as an index using `ensure_index` before using `loc`.
- The additional condition for `list` type checks for any boolean values within the list to distinguish between boolean-based indexing and label-based indexing.

This revised approach ensures consistent handling of different indexer types and should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
