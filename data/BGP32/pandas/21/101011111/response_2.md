To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. The bug causes a KeyError when using list-like indexers, while other types of indexers work correctly.

The issue arises due to the specific handling of list-like indexers in the function, leading to the KeyError when trying to index with a list. To resolve this issue, we should unify the behavior across different types of indexers and ensure that list-like indexers are processed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle list-like indexers the same way as other types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior across different types. This change should resolve the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests and align with the expected behavior for indexing a Series with various indexer types.
