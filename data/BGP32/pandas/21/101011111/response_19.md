### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is causing issues when indexing with a list. The problem arises when the key is a list-like object where the function does not handle it properly compared to other types of indexers like arrays or indexes. This inconsistency leads to failing tests.

### Bug Explanation
1. For list-like key inputs, the function does not correctly handle the indexing logic, causing a KeyError when trying to access elements that are not present in the index.
2. The function treats list-like inputs differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior during indexing operations.
3. As a result, the current implementation raises a KeyError for list-like keys, which is not aligned with the expected behavior of other indexers like arrays or indexes.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic for list-like key inputs to provide consistent behavior with other indexers like arrays or indexes.
2. Ensure that a list-like key input is processed properly without raising a KeyError for missing elements in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Check if the key is list-like to handle the indexing case properly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments in the corrected version, the function will treat list-like key inputs consistently with other indexers like arrays or indexes, resolving the KeyError issue and aligning with the expected behavior.
