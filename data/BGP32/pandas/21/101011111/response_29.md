Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue arises when using a list as an indexer. The function needs to handle list-like indexers correctly, akin to how other indexers are managed. The checks for various types of indexers are causing discrepancies, particularly when dealing with a list as an indexer.

To fix this bug, we need to unify the handling of different types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior across all cases. Specifically, we should adjust the code to properly handle list-like indexers as they are currently causing the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Try running the failing tests again with this corrected function to ensure that the issue has been resolved.
