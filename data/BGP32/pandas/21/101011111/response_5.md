## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the Pandas library. When the function receives an index key that is a list-like object (e.g., a list or ndarray) containing a value not present in the index of the series, the function should raise a `KeyError`. However, the existing implementation of the function does not handle the list-like keys consistently, leading to different behaviors depending on the type of the key.

In the failing test cases, the input key is converted to a list, but the function treats a list differently than other indexers like arrays or pandas Index objects. This inconsistency leads to the incorrect handling of the key and ultimately results in the test failures.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug and ensure consistent behavior for all types of index keys, we should modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in the same way it handles other indexers like arrays or pandas Index objects. This change will align the function's behavior with the expected output and resolve the test failures.

## Correction of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert key to a list if it's not already list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Convert key to a list if it's an Index object
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Treat the key either as positional or label-based based on the index
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle any duplicate indexing cases
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making the suggested changes, the `_get_with` function will now properly handle list-like keys, convert them to a list if needed, and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, resolving the test failures and aligning the function with the expected output.
