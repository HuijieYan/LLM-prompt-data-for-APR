After analyzing the provided information and identifying the potential issue in the `_get_with` function, we can see that the problem lies in the handling of list-like indexers. The function treats different types of indexers differently, leading to inconsistencies and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects. We can modify the function to treat list-like indexers in the same way as other types to maintain consistency and avoid the KeyError raised in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other indexers, preventing the KeyError from being raised in the failing tests.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should function correctly and pass the failing tests related to list-like indexers, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue regarding inconsistent behavior in index handling.
