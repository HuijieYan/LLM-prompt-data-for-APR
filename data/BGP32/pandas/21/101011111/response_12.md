Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing tests, the key issue lies in the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer. The function is not properly handling list indexers, leading to a KeyError when trying to access elements with a list of keys.

To fix this, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers. The correction should involve updating the logic for list indexers to align with the behavior of array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle list indexers and provide consistent behavior across different types of key indexers, ensuring that the failing tests pass and the function aligns with the expected input/output values as described. This fix addresses the reported issue on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects.
