### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` tries to handle different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test if the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers, such as lists, ndarrays, Series, and Index instances.
3. The expected input/output values are described for cases where the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series containing a single element that does not match any index in the Series.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different index types, especially when it encounters a list-like key that does not match any index in the Series.
5. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers like arrays, lists, Series, or Index instances.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key that does not match any index in the Series. In this case, the function incorrectly tries to access the `loc` directly instead of raising a `KeyError` as expected. This behavior is inconsistent with how other index types are handled and leads to unexpected outcomes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug and make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers, we should modify the handling of list-like keys that do not match any index in the Series. Instead of trying to access the `loc` directly, the function should raise a `KeyError` in this case to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and self._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    # previously incorrect code that has been removed:
    # return self.reindex(key)
```

By raising a `KeyError` when the key does not match any index in the Series, the correct behavior is achieved for all types of indexers, as expected. This fix aligns the function with the standard behavior of handling unmatched keys and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
