The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with a list key that does not have matches in the Series index. The current implementation fails when processing a list index and throws a KeyError, causing inconsistency compared to other types of indexers.

The detected error location lies in the following code block:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```

The bug occurs because the `is_list_like` condition should not return directly. When dealing with a list key that does not match the index, it should follow the same flow as other types of indexers to ensure consistency.

To fix the bug, we should modify the handling of list key indexers and make it more aligned with the behavior of other indexers. A potential strategy is to remove the direct return in the `is_list_like` block and instead fall back to the existing logic for handling indexers that result in a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This fix ensures that the `_get_with` function handles list key indexers consistently with other types, preventing KeyError issues and aligning the behavior with the expectations set in the failing test case.
