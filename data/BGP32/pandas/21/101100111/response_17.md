## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing. However, the bug occurs when the key is a list-like object, causing inconsistent behavior compared to other types of key inputs. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test case where a `KeyError` is raised only when the key is a list, but not when it is an ndarray, Index, or Series.

## Error Location:
The bug occurs in the logic branch where the key is checked for being list-like. The issue arises in the following part of the code:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
Here, it treats list-like objects differently from other types of indexers, leading to the inconsistency.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the conditional check for list-like objects in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list, it directly uses `self.loc[key]` which raises a `KeyError` for indexing with a list. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of ndarray, Index, and Series types where no error is raised. This inconsistency arises due to the special handling of list-like objects in the conditional check.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and ensure consistent behavior, the conditional check for list-like objects needs to be modified to handle all types of indexers uniformly. By treating list-like objects the same as other types of indexers, we can eliminate the inconsistency and ensure that the code behaves correctly across different key input types.

## Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:
```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Unify all list-like objects
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, all types of indexers are treated uniformly, including list-like objects. This will ensure consistent behavior across different key input types and resolve the inconsistency identified in the failing test case.
