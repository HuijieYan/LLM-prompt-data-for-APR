## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is encountering issues with handling different types of indexers, especially when a list indexer is used. The function is not consistent in its behavior when dealing with various types of indexers such as ndarray, Index, Series, and list.

The failing test case highlights the inconsistency when using a list indexer, causing a `KeyError` due to the list indexer not being recognized correctly.

## Bug Explanation
1. When a list indexer is passed to the `_get_with` function, it tries to infer the type of the indexer and decides between positional and label-based indexing. However, this inference is failing to recognize the list type correctly.
2. Due to this incorrect inference, the function tries to handle the indexer differently based on its type, leading to errors like `KeyError` when dealing with list indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies and handles list indexers, treating them consistently with other indexers. We can simplify the logic by handling list indexers in a uniform manner to avoid inconsistencies. The fix should ensure that list indexers are processed correctly without causing errors.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # treating scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Handle list indexers in a uniform manner
    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Default behavior
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected version above, we ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, avoiding the `KeyError` issue during the test execution. This corrected version should align with the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to inconsistent behavior with different indexers.
