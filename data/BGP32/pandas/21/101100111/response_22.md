To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case when `key` is a list differently. Currently, the code treats a key that is a list the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to an inconsistency in behavior.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when `key` is a list, it is treated appropriately to resolve the inconsistency in behavior highlighted by the failing tests.

By fixing the logic related to list indexers, we can now ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are handled consistently and the expected KeyError exception is raised when necessary.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue mentioned, addressing the inconsistency in how list indexers were handled compared to other types of indexers in a Series object.
