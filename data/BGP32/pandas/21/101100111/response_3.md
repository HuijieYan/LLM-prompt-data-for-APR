The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of indexers, specifically when the key is a list. The function fails to properly process list-like indexers, resulting in a raised `KeyError` when trying to index a Series with a list when no matches are found.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the case when the key is a list is correctly handled in a similar manner to other array-like indexers. We can achieve this by adjusting the condition that checks for list-like indexers and updating the logic accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key handling logic to properly handle list-like indexers along with array-like indexers, the corrected function should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
