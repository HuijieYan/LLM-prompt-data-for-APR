## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, the bug arises when handling a list-like key input, where the function incorrectly processes the key. This issue is related to how the function distinguishes between list, ndarray, Index, Series, and other types of key inputs.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of key inputs (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to index a Series and expects consistent behavior for all cases. The bug occurs when using a list as the key input, leading to a `KeyError` exception instead of returning a `NaN` value.

Based on the expected input/output values and the failing test, the bug seems to be in the logic where the function handles list-like key inputs.

## Bug Cause
The buggy function `_get_with` does not correctly handle list-like key inputs. When processing a list key, it prematurely constructs the `key` variable as a list (if it is not an instance of `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`). This results in incorrect indexing behavior, causing the `KeyError` exception to be raised for list-like keys.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle list-like key inputs in the `_get_with` function. The function should differentiate between various key types and apply the appropriate indexing logic based on the type of key input.

The corrected version of the function should properly check the type of the key input and handle list-like keys separately to ensure consistent behavior for all types of key inputs.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Properly handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function includes additional checks for list-like keys and handles them appropriately to prevent the `KeyError` exception from occurring. This corrected version should pass the failing test and ensure consistent behavior for all types of key inputs.
