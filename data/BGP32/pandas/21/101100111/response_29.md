## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the Series at that key. The main issue lies in the conditional checks and handling for different types of keys.

### Error Locations
1. The conditional check `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` is incorrect as it misses the case when key is a pandas `Index`. This leads to a wrong type inference.
2. There is inconsistency in how list-like keys are handled, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The inference of the key type is not being correctly used to determine the indexing strategy.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of list-like keys, incorrect type inference for keys that are not of recognized types, and incorrect conditional checks.

### Strategy for Fixing
1. Adjust the conditional checks to include `Index` in the check for key types.
2. Ensure consistent handling of list-like keys to prevent `KeyError` when accessing keys.
3. Use the inferred key type to correctly determine the indexing strategy.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with the handling of different key types and the inconsistent behavior for list-like keys, ensuring that the function returns the desired output without throwing a `KeyError`.
