The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to a failing test case. The function incorrectly processes the key when it is a list, causing a KeyError when trying to access the value. This behavior is inconsistent with how array-like indexers are handled.

To fix this bug:
1. Check if the key is a list-like object and handle it appropriately.
2. Ensure that the key is converted to the correct type to avoid KeyError when accessing the value.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        # handle slice, DataFrame, and tuple cases
        return NotImplemented

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    # Convert key to the appropriate type to avoid KeyError
    key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistent behavior and passing the failing test case.
