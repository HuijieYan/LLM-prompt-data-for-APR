### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, and lists. The bug arises when dealing with a list-like key where the indexing fails to match the behavior of other indexers like NumPy arrays or pandas Index objects.

The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the behavior for list-like indexers to be consistent with other indexers like NumPy arrays or Index objects. However, the current implementation of the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like keys properly, leading to a KeyError in this specific case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes a KeyError when trying to index a Series using a list-like key. The issue stems from the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers compared to other types like NumPy arrays or Index objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers. Specifically, the `_get_with` function should treat list-like keys in a similar manner to NumPy arrays or Index objects to maintain consistency and prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or not hasattr(key, 'any'):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_array = np.array(key)
    
    # Convert the ndarray to a list if not already
    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = key_array.flatten().tolist()
    
    if key_array.dtype == 'bool':
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_array.dtype == 'int':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, list-like keys will be handled consistently with other types of indexers in the Series class, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test case.
