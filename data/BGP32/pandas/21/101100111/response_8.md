## Analysis

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input `key` for indexing a `Series`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the case where `key` is a list. The function checks if `key` is not list-like and proceeds to call `self.loc[key]`. However, when `key` is a list, this approach leads to an incorrect behavior compared to other index types.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to verify the behavior of indexing a `Series` with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series containing values that are not present in the Series' index. The test expects a `KeyError` with a specific message when indexing with values that are not present in the index.

The GitHub issue highlights inconsistency in the behavior of indexing with different index types, especially when the values are not present in the index. The issue points out the discrepancy in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers and suggests aligning the behavior to be consistent across all index types.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when `key` is a list. The function incorrectly assumes that non-list-like keys can be directly handled by `self.loc[key]`, leading to an incorrect outcome. This behavior inconsistency with list indexers has been identified as an issue in the GitHub report.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and align the behavior with the expected outcomes from the failing test and GitHub issue:
1. Check if `key` is a list and handle it differently from other non-list-like keys.
2. When `key` is a list, reindex the `Series` with the key to ensure consistency in handling indexers.
3. Ensure that the function returns the appropriate results based on the type of `key` provided for indexing.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when `key` is detected as a list, it correctly reindexes the `Series` based on the list values, aligning with the expected behavior across different index types and resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
