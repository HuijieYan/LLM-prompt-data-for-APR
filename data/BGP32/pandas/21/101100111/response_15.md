## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc. The bug arises when dealing with list-like indexers, leading to different behavior compared to array-like or other types of indexers.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior for different types of indexers, but the buggy implementation does not provide the expected output for list-like indexers, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The expected outcome is to have consistent behavior across all types of indexers as mentioned in the GitHub issue, where `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` should behave similarly to `ser[list(key)]`, providing `NaN` values, and not raising a `KeyError`.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When dealing with list-like indexers, the function does not provide the expected behavior, resulting in a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` values.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers similar to array-like or other types of indexers. Specifically, for list-like indexers, the function should return `NaN` values when the key does not match any values in the index.

## Corrected Implementation
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        result = self.loc[key]

        # Check if any key is not in the index and set them to NaN
        for k in key:
            if k not in self.index:
                result[k] = np.nan

        return result

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_get_with` function should now provide consistent behavior for list-like indexers, returning `NaN` values for keys not present in the index, and avoiding the `KeyError` raised in the failing test.

Please replace the buggy function with this corrected version in the `pandas/core/series.py` file to resolve the issue.
