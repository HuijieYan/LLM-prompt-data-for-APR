## Identified Issue
The buggy function `_get_with` fails to handle the case where the `key` parameter is a list-like object correctly. It treats the list indexing differently from other array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in some situations.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when the `key` parameter is a list, it should behave similarly to other array-like indexers but currently results in an error.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers, including list-like objects, within the `_get_with` function. By updating the logic to handle list-like indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers, we can address the inconsistency and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        # handle the case of list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes and handling list-like indexers on par with other array-like structures, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexers as expected.
