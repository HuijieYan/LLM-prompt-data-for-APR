## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the bug arises when a key of type list is passed to the function, resulting in an inconsistency with other types of indexers.

## Error Location
The bug is located in the section where the function handles the case when the key is not list-like. The issue arises when trying to index the Series using a list key.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function does not appropriately handle the scenario when a list key is used for indexing a Series, resulting in a KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the `_get_with` function that deals with list-like keys. We should ensure that the function handles list keys in a consistent manner as other types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function includes handling list keys consistently with other indexers by converting them to a list earlier in the function. This modification ensures that list keys are processed correctly and prevent the KeyError issue.
