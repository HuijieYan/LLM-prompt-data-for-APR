The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list-like key is provided, the function fails to handle it properly, resulting in a KeyError.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers. Additionally, the function should check for the presence of the key in the index before performing any operations to avoid KeyError exceptions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now explicitly checks if the keys are present in the index before proceeding with further operations. This ensures that the function handles list-like keys consistently with other indexers.

This updated version should now pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers as mentioned in the GitHub issue cited.
