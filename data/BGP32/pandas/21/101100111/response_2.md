## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue arises from the different treatments of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `ser` function. To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across all types of indexers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the case of list indexer
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index` for array-like indexers and handling the case of list indexers specifically, we ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
