## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, in the current implementation, there is a discrepancy in the handling of indexers when passed as lists compared to when passed as arrays or Index objects. This results in the failure of the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` when `key` is provided as a list. The key issue seems to be the inconsistency in how different indexers are processed within the function.

## Identified Bug:
The buggy function `_get_with` fails to handle list indexers properly, leading to a `KeyError` exception being raised for the test case `test_getitem_no_matches` where the `key` is a list. This behavior is not consistent with how other types of indexers are processed in the function, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled the same way as other indexers like arrays or Index objects within the `_get_with` function. By making the handling of different indexers consistent, we can resolve the issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected for all types of indexers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other indexers, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` and maintain consistency in how different types of indexers are processed.
