The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is failing to handle the case where a list indexer is passed as the key. This results in a KeyError being raised incorrectly, as observed in the failing test case scenario.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the portion of the code that handles the provided key when it is not recognized as a list-like object. The buggy section is shown below:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because, even though the key is a list-like object, the function incorrectly converts it to a list using `list(key)`. As a result, the key is processed incorrectly in subsequent steps, leading to the raised KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the list-like object key without converting it to a list. This can be achieved by directly verifying if the key is iterable and then performing the necessary operations based on its type.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key without conversion
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle the dup indexing case for lists
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Expected Outcome:
After applying this correction, the corrected function should pass the failing test case by properly handling the list indexer without raising a KeyError when accessing the Series. The corrected function should also satisfy the expected input/output values and resolve the GitHub issue related to the API inconsistency.
