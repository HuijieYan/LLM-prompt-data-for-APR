### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where the key is checked for different types and then operations are performed based on the type of key. However, when the key is of type `Index`, the bug arises. In the buggy function, when the key is of type `Index`, the `key_type` variable is assigned the value of `key.inferred_type`. Later on, when deciding how to index the `Series` object, it uses `key_type` to determine whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing. This is where the bug arises because the key type should not be inferred directly from the `Index` object. The correct approach is to consider the type of the object, rather than inferring it.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify how the `key_type` is determined when the key is of type `Index`. Instead of directly inferring the type, we should check the type of the `key` object. This will ensure a more accurate type identification and resolve the issue of improper indexing based on inferred type.

### Correction of the Buggy Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = 'Index'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction ensures that the `key_type` is determined correctly based on the type of the `key` object rather than inferring it. By making this adjustment, the bug related to indexing with `Index` objects should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass successfully.
