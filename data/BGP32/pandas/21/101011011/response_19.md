### Issue Analysis
The bug occurs when indexing a `Series` with a list-like key, such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. In this case, the function `_get_with` fails to handle the key properly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised in certain scenarios. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled and questions the reason behind this behavior. The specific test case added in PR #5880 is provided as an example where the current behavior shows inconsistency.

### Bug Cause
The bug stems from how the function `_get_with` handles list-like keys. When a list-like key is passed, the function incorrectly processes it, leading to KeyError exceptions in specific cases. The handling of different types of indexers is inconsistent, as mentioned in the GitHub issue, and the current implementation fails to maintain uniform behavior across various types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list-like keys regardless of whether they are lists, ndarrays, Index objects, or Series. The key should be processed correctly to avoid KeyError exceptions, aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. This fix involves modifying the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys appropriately and prevent inconsistencies.

### Bug Fix and Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Process list-like key uniformly
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.inferred_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` to consistently handle list-like keys, the corrected function ensures uniform behavior when indexing a `Series`. This fix aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and resolves the inconsistency in indexing different types of keys.
