### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and arrays for indexing a Series.
2. The failing tests indicate that when using either a list, ndarray, Index, or Series as the key, the function does not handle the case where none of the elements in the key are present in the Series index.
3. The bug seems to stem from the handling of key types that are not present in the Series index, leading to a KeyError that is not being raised as expected, causing test failures.
4. The key_type variable in the buggy function is being incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, which is not handling all possible key types appropriately.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of key types that are not found in the Series index. When using list, ndarray, Index, or Series as the key, the function fails to raise a KeyError when none of the elements in the key exist in the index, leading to test failures.

### Fix Strategy:
To address the bug, we need to update the logic in handling cases where the key elements are not present in the Series index. The function should raise a KeyError when none of the key elements are found in the index, ensuring consistent behavior across different key input types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to raise a KeyError when none of the key elements are found in the Series index for all applicable key types, the corrected function should now handle such cases correctly and pass the failing tests.
