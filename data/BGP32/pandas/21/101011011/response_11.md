### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The error messages from the failing tests indicate that the issue arises when using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series as the key. The bug results in inconsistent behavior when indexing with different types of keys, leading to KeyError exceptions.

From the runtime values provided, it's evident that the `key_type` is incorrectly assigned as `'string'`. This could be due to improper inference or handling of the key types within the function.

The provided GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys, specifically mentioning the case of using a list indexer resulting in a KeyError, unlike other types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from mishandling the key types within the `_get_with` function. The incorrect inference of the key type and subsequent decision regarding positional or label-based indexing leads to the inconsistency in behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of key inputs, including lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series, are handled consistently in the `_get_with` function. Proper handling of key types and alignment with the indexing mechanism of the Series should resolve the KeyError exceptions encountered in the failing tests.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring consistent handling of key types and respecting the indexing mechanism of Series, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the issue reported in the failing tests and align with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
