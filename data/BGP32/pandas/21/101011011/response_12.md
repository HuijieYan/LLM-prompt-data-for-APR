### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The function seems to handle various types of key inputs like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
3. The error message indicates that the test cases fail when indexing a Series with keys of type list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
4. The buggy function seems to incorrectly handle the case when the key input is a list, leading to a KeyError.
5. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers. The expected behavior is to handle them all in a similar way, similar to the behavior observed with ndarray or Index key types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the handling of list type key input in the `_get_with` function. It fails to properly handle list indexers, leading to a KeyError in the test cases.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers like ndarray, Index, or Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the function will now handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests.
