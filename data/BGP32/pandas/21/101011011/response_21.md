### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class treats different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) inconsistently when attempting to access elements in the series. Specifically, the function fails to handle `list` indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existing elements.

The issue arose due to the inconsistent handling of indexers within the function, causing a misinterpretation of the keys and resulting in errors during the indexing process.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are handled consistently by the `_get_with` function. This would involve updating the logic to correctly interpret the keys and handle the indexing operation properly for all cases.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    else:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, all types of indexers should now be handled consistently and efficiently, resolving the `KeyError` issue that was encountered during indexing.
