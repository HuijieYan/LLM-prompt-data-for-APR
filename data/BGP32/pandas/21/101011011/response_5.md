### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is responsible for indexing a Series object with different types of keys.
2. The key types handled in the function include slices, DataFrames, tuples, single elements, lists, arrays, and Index objects.
3. The bug arises in cases where the key is a list, causing a KeyError to be raised, unlike other types of keys.
4. The error message from the failing test indicates that a KeyError is expected, but it is not being raised for list keys.
5. The key_type inferred in the function seems to be incorrect when dealing with list keys, leading to the incorrect behavior.
6. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list keys in the `_get_with(key)` function. When the key is of type list, the function fails to treat it properly, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list keys to ensure that the KeyError is raised when necessary. We can modify the conditional statements and the key_type inference to correctly identify list keys and handle them appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = "list"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including a specific condition for handling list keys and adjusting the key_type inference accordingly, this corrected version should address the bug and ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
