### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` aims to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others, to retrieve values from a Series.
2. The bug seems to occur when the key is a list-like object, specifically when calling `ser[key]` with `key` being a list, which results in a `KeyError`.
3. The key issue seems to lie in the handling of list-like keys where the function is not correctly identifying the type and processing the key, resulting in the `KeyError`.
4. The `KeyError` message indicates that the key values in a list are not present in the index when trying to retrieve values based on those keys. This indicates an indexing issue in the `_get_with` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly and values are retrieved based on those keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is a list-like object before processing it.
2. If the key is a list, ensure that the values in the list are present in the index before attempting to retrieve them.
3. Handle list keys appropriately to prevent the `KeyError` during indexing.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_missing = set(key) - set(self.index)
        if key_missing:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key_missing} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes additional handling for list keys to check if all the values in the list are present in the index before attempting to retrieve them. If any values are missing, a `KeyError` is raised. This modification should resolve the issue with list-like keys resulting in a `KeyError`.
