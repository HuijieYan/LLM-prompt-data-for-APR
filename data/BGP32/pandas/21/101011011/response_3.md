### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, etc.) for a Series object.
2. The failing test cases indicate that the bug arises when using a list as an indexer, as the behavior differs from other types.
3. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers, leading to KeyError inconsistencies.
4. The runtime values show that the `key_type` is incorrectly determined as `'string'`, which indicates a possible bug in inferring the indexer type.
5. The GitHub issue describes a similar inconsistency between list indexers and array-like indexers, indicating that the current behavior might not be intended.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect inference of the indexer type for list indexers, leading to a mismatch in handling these indexers compared to array-like indexers. This results in a KeyError inconsistency when attempting to access elements using list indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers, preventing the KeyError inconsistency. We should review the logic for inferring the indexer type and adjust the handling of list indexers accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Inferring the type of the key
    if is_list_like(key):
        key_type = 'list'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly identifying list indexers and handling them similarly to other array-like indexers, the corrected version should address the KeyError inconsistency for list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
