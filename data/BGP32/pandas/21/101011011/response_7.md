### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc., when indexing a Series.
2. The failing tests indicate that when passing a list as an indexer, the behavior is inconsistent compared to passing other types like arrays, Series, and Index.
3. The error message suggests that the issue lies in the handling of list indexers, which results in a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent keys.
4. The key_type is determined incorrectly as `'string'` instead of the expected type based on the input parameter.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of list indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to locate keys that do not exist. Additionally, the `key_type` is inferred incorrectly as `'string'`, causing unexpected behavior when selecting data.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types, and the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the indexer type. We should also address the issue related to expecting a KeyError message when the key doesn't exist in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of scalar keys, checking for key existence, adjusting the key_type inference, and addressing the `KeyError` issue when a key is not present, the corrected version aims to resolve the bug and align the behavior of different indexer types.
