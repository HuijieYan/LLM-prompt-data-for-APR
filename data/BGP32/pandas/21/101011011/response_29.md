### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling different types of key inputs, specifically when the key is a list. The function incorrectly processes a list key, leading to a `KeyError` in cases where a list is used as an index, which is inconsistent behavior compared to other index types like arrays or pandas `Index`. This inconsistency is highlighted by the GitHub issue, where the behavior for list indexers differs from array-like indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to correctly handle list key inputs to ensure consistent behavior across different index types. By adjusting the logic to handle list keys with the same consistency as other index types, we can resolve the `KeyError` issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the mentioned adjustments to handle list keys correctly, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
