### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with()` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes the key input when it is a list. The function should treat a list key index like the other indexers, such as numpy arrays or Pandas Index objects, but it currently raises a KeyError.

The failing tests indicate that for list, array, Index, and Series key types, the behavior is expected to be consistent, but the function does not handle lists correctly according to the GitHub issue.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function receives a list as the key for indexing the `Series`. It incorrectly processes the list, resulting in a KeyError when trying to locate the elements in the index. This inconsistency leads to different behavior for list key indexers compared to other types, like array-like indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with()` function to handle list key indexers in the same way as other valid indexers, such as numpy arrays or Pandas Index objects. By making the behavior consistent across different types of key input, we can resolve the KeyError issue and align the function's behavior with the expected results from the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this correction in the `_get_with()` function, the behavior for list key indexers should align with the expected results from the failing tests, resolving the KeyError issue and ensuring consistency in handling different types of key inputs.
