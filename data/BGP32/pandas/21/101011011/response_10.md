### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition check for `is_list_like(key)` might not correctly identify cases where `key` is passed as a list.
2. The conversion of `key` to a list might lead to unexpected outcomes based on the type of `key`.
3. The determination of `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype` might not accurately capture the nature of `key`.
4. The conditional logic for handling different types of keys may lead to incorrect paths being taken.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from how the function `_get_with` handles different types of keys. In the failing tests, the `key` is either a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function contains conditional statements to handle these cases differently. However, the identification and treatment of `key` types seem to be incorrect, leading to a KeyError in the test cases.

For example, when `key` is a list passed from a Series of dtype 'object', the function fails to handle it properly, resulting in a KeyError. This inconsistency in handling different key types is highlighted in the GitHub issue provided.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
1. Improve the detection of list-like keys to ensure accurate identification.
2. Refine the logic for handling different key types to follow a consistent and correct path.
3. Verify the conversion of keys to ensure compatibility with further operations.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes modifications to handle list-like keys correctly, improve the detection of key types, and ensure a consistent approach to handling different key types. By addressing these issues, the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
