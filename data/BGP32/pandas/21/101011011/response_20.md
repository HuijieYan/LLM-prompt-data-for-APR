### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling different types of indexers. The function has conditional checks for different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalar values, lists, and specific data types. The bug arises specifically when dealing with list-like indexers, which are not being handled correctly, causing a KeyError to be raised incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. We will need to update the conditional checks and logic that determine how to process list-like indexers to prevent the KeyError from being raised inappropriately.

### Bug Fix:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key): # Change made for handling list-like indexers correctly
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly, preventing the KeyError from being raised in the specific case identified in the failing test. This fix should resolve the issue and allow the function to behave as intended for list-like indexers.
