### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series.
2. The failing tests indicate that when using a list as an indexer, the function fails to handle it correctly.
3. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from incorrectly identifying the `key_type` in various scenarios, leading to incorrect handling of the indexer, especially when a list is passed as an indexer.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the `key_type` and ensure that a list indexer is handled appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now correctly handle different types of indexers, including lists, addressing the bug and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
