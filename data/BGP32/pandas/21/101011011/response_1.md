### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` aims to handle various key types like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index.
2. The failing tests provide different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to index the Series.
3. The bug seems to be related to how list-like keys are handled compared to other types, resulting in a KeyError when indexing the Series.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers with a Series object.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access elements not present in the index of the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when indexing a Series. This includes properly handling list-like keys to prevent KeyError when elements are not found in the Series index.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like keys properly
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other types of keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        if key.empty:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function to handle list-like keys properly and adjusting the condition checks for different key types, we can ensure consistent behavior and prevent the KeyError when indexing the Series.
