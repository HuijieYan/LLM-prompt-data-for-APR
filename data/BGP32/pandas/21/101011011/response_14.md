### Identified Issue:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of indexers where the type is a list. The function treats array-like indexers differently from list indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a `KeyError` when using a list as an indexer.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The function contains logic to handle different types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, etc. However, when dealing with a list as an indexer, the function incorrectly processes it.
2. The code path followed when the indexer is a list checks for specific types like arrays, indexes, and series but treats a list as a generic `key` without specific handling, leading to incorrect behavior and the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers similar to how other array-like indexers are processed. This involves properly identifying the type of the key (list) and adjusting the logic to handle it correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the logic to properly handle list indexers and adjust the type checking for arrays, indexes, and series, we ensure consistent behavior and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised when using a list as an indexer.
