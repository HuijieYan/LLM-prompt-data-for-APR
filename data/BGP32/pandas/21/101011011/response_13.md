### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is encountering an issue when dealing with list-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to array-like indexers. Specifically, when a list indexer is passed, it raises a `KeyError`, while array-like indexers do not exhibit this behavior. This difference in handling causes confusion and inconsistency in how the function processes different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The key cause of the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional check for list-like indexers. When the key is not recognized as list-like, it attempts to use `self.loc[key]`, but the behavior is inconsistent with how array-like indexers are processed. This inconsistency results in a `KeyError` when a list indexer is passed, as observed in the failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug and align the handling of list-like indexers with array-like indexers, the condition for list-like key types should be revised to handle them consistently. By adjusting the conditional logic to match the behavior of other indexers, the bug can be fixed.

### Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently with other types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are processed consistently with other indexers, preventing the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests. This fix aligns the behavior of handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.
