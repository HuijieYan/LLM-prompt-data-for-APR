### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexing keys, but it fails to correctly handle the case when the key is a list-like object.
2. The failing test cases indicate that when a list-like key is used to index a Series, a KeyError is expected but not raised, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The key_type variable is incorrectly identified as 'string' when processing list-like keys, which should trigger a reindex operation but fails due to the wrong key type assignment.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with different types of objects, especially lists, in Series, leading to unexpected errors and results.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from incorrectly assigning the key_type as 'string' for list-like keys, which results in the function not handling the reindex operation correctly for those keys, causing the KeyError to not be raised as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Identify list-like keys correctly and handle them appropriately by triggering the reindex operation.
2. Ensure that the key_type is properly inferred for different types of keys to determine the indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Infer the key type correctly for list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Correctly handle list-like keys for reindexing
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the identification and handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should pass the failing test cases and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
