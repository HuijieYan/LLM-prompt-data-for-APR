### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. The function aims to determine the type of the key input parameter and perform the corresponding indexing operation. However, when the key is a list-like object, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError` exception being raised when indexing a `Series`.

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the block of code that checks if the key is not list-like:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
In this case, the function erroneously tries to use `self.loc` when indexing a list, resulting in the `KeyError` exception.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function does not appropriately handle list-like objects when determining the key type. It mistakenly treats a list-like key the same way as a non-list-like key, leading to the wrong indexing operation and the subsequent `KeyError` when attempting to access the `Series`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that when the key is list-like, the function uses the correct indexing method to avoid the `KeyError`. This can be achieved by updating the code that deals with non-list-like keys to correctly handle list-like keys.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by including proper handling for list-like keys and ensuring the correct indexing operation is performed. This should resolve the `KeyError` exceptions encountered in the failing tests.
