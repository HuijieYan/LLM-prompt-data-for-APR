### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers in a `Series` object. However, the bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like indexer, leading to a `KeyError` exception not being properly raised. This inconsistency in handling different indexer types was highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other indexers. When a list-like key is passed to `ser[key]`, a `KeyError` exception is expected to be raised, but due to discrepancies in how list indexers are processed, the error is not being thrown as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including list-like ones, are handled consistently. Specifically, the code should correctly handle list type key inputs to provide the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the inconsistency when handling list indexers compared to other indexers will be resolved, ensuring that the correct behavior is maintained for all types of input indexes.
