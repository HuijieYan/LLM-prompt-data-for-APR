### Identified Issue
The bug occurs when the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class encounters a list-like key for indexing. The function does not handle list-like keys properly, leading to a `KeyError` during indexing.

The issue arises from how different types of indexers (array-like, list, etc.) are treated inconsistently within the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Explanation
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class expects to receive specific types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, or individual scalars. However, when a list-like key is provided, the function fails to handle it correctly. As a result, the `KeyError` is raised during indexing since the function cannot find the corresponding values in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys. We should ensure that list-like keys are processed in a consistent manner with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):  # Handle list-like keys properly
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the logic to properly handle list-like keys, this corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub discussion.
