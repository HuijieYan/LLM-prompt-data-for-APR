### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs like slices, data frames, tuples, and list-like objects.
- The failing test cases are related to how list objects are being handled, causing a `KeyError` when indexing with a list key.
- The bug is specifically related to how list-like objects are processed differently from other types like arrays, indexes, or series within the `_get_with` function.
- The cause of the bug is the inconsistent handling of list-like objects when processing the key in the `_get_with` function, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to index with a list key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like objects are treated consistently with other types like arrays, indexes, or series when processing the key in the `_get_with` function. By making the handling of list-like objects consistent with other types, we can prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list-like objects and ensuring they follow a consistent path with other types in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should address the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing tests related to indexing with a list key.
