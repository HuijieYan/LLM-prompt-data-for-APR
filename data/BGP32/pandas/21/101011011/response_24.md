### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases are related to indexing the Series with a list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The bug causes an inconsistency in how different types of key indexers are handled, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
4. The bug seems to originate from the conditional checks and branching within the `_get_with` function, particularly in handling list-like key indexers.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers, with a specific focus on list indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function, specifically when dealing with list-like key indexers. This leads to a KeyError in cases where the expected behavior should not raise an exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of key indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when indexing a Series. This includes updating the logic to handle list-like key indexers correctly to prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like key indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like key indexers and ensuring a consistent approach for all types of key indexers, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the KeyError issues in the failing tests and adhere to the expected behavior when indexing a Series.
