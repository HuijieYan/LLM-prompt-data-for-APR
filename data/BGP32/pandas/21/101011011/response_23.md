### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index.
2. The error occurs when using a list indexer, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The issue stems from treating list indexers differently compared to other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.
4. The `_get_with` function needs to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers to maintain consistency.

### Potential Bug Location:
The bug likely exists in the treatment of list indexers in the `_get_with` function, specifically in the block of code after handling non-list-like keys.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers, leading to a `KeyError` being raised for list indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated similarly to other array-like indexers. This involves adjusting the handling of list indexers and ensuring consistency with the behavior of other indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the treatment of list indexers to align with other array-like indexers, the corrected function should now handle list indexers consistently and resolve the `KeyError` issue.
