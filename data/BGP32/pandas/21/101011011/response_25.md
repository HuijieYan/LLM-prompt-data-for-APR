### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to handle different types of input keys, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, Series, and Index objects.
2. The failing tests indicate that for certain key types, like lists and arrays, the function does not return the expected result and raises a `KeyError`.
3. The runtime values show that the variable `key_type` is incorrectly assigned the value `'string'`, which leads to an incorrect branching decision.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers, especially when dealing with list-like objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug likely arises from the incorrect inference of the `key_type`. This incorrect inference leads to wrong decisions in handling the key, particularly for list-like objects, causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure correct inference of the `key_type` to accurately determine the type of the key being used.
2. Adjust the logic for handling different key types based on the correct `key_type` inference.
3. Update the conditions to correctly handle list-like objects to prevent `KeyError` from being raised.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle scalar keys correctly
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure correct Index type handling
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the inference of `key_type`, handling scalar keys appropriately, ensuring the Index type for further processing, and updating the conditions for list-like objects handling, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue.
