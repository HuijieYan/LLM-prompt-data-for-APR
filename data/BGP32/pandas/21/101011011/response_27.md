### Issue Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs. However, there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.
- The failing tests are trying to access a Series element using different types of indexers, and the bug causes a `KeyError` when using a list indexer.
- Based on the runtime input values provided, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'`, leading to the incorrect handling of the list indexer.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs when the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` for the provided list-like input. This causes the function to execute the wrong path in the conditional statements, ultimately leading to a `KeyError`.
- The error message points to the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers, which the fix should address.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly identify the type of the key being used. In the case of a list-like key, it should be handled consistently with other array-like indexers.
- The fix should aim to make the behavior uniform regardless of the type of indexer used, matching the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers consistently with array-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function addresses the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers compared to array-like indexers, making the behavior uniform and resolving the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests. This fix aligns with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
