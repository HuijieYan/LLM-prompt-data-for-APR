## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the issue arises when indexing with a list like key, causing a KeyError. This issue is related to handling list indexers differently from array-like indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function fails to check for the specific type of key and handle it accordingly.

## Error Location
The issue occurs when the function encounters a list-like key for indexing, leading to an incorrect behavior and ultimately causing a KeyError during indexing.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug originates from the function's inadequate handling of list indexers, where it fails to check for the specific type of key and treat it correctly. This inconsistency in handling list-like keys compared to array-like keys leads to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to enhance the function `_get_with` to correctly handle list-like keys for indexing a Series. Specifically, we should ensure that when the key is a list, we treat it appropriately and avoid the KeyError situation.

## Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By enhancing the logic to handle list indexers appropriately, the corrected function ensures that indexing with a list-like key does not result in a KeyError. The fix aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases and addresses the inconsistency discussed in the GitHub issue.
