### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, Series, and Index.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior when trying to access a Series with an indexer that has no matches in the index.
3. The bug occurs when processing a list-like key that does not have any matches in the Series index. The function should return a KeyError, but instead, it attempts to reindex the Series with the key, causing an issue.
4. The key issue lies in the handling of list-like keys. The function mistakenly tries to reindex with a key that doesn't exist in the Series index, leading to the incorrect behavior.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the behavior when dealing with list-like keys that do not match any index values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the section of the function that handles list-like keys to raise a KeyError when the key does not match any index values.
2. This adjustment will align the behavior with the expected outcome when accessing a Series with an indexer that has no matches in the index.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Fixed version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0 or not any(key in self.index):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys to raise a KeyError when no matches are found in the Series index, the corrected function aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug described in the failing test.
