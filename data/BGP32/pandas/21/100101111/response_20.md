**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when trying to access an element in the Series using an indexer that does not exist in the index.
3. The bug seems to lie in how the function handles different types of indexers, especially when passed a list indexer.
4. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when using a list indexer, which is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of indexers, leading to the failing test.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior and suggests aligning the behavior with list indexers to be similar to other types of indexers.

**Bug Cause:**

The bug stems from how the function handles list indexers differently from other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError when using a list indexer. This behavior is inconsistent with the treatment of other indexers and causes the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**

To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list indexers in a similar manner as other types of indexers to maintain consistency in behavior. This would involve ensuring that list indexers are processed correctly without raising a KeyError.

**Updated Corrected Version:**
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list): 
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list indexers to include a try-except block within the function, we can prevent the KeyError from being raised and achieve more consistent behavior across different indexer types, as suggested in the GitHub issue.
