### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. The bug occurs when the function encounters a key that is a list-like object, leading to an incorrect behavior in the `not is_list_like(key)` block. This causes issues when trying to index the Series with a list, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug is primarily caused by mishandling list-like objects in the `_get_with` function.
- When the function encounters a key that is a list, it falls into the `not is_list_like(key)` block and tries to access `self.loc[key]`. Since it should handle list-like objects differently, this causes the KeyError when attempting to index with that key.

### Fix Strategy:
- We need to modify the handling of list-like objects in the `_get_with` function to correctly process them just like other types of key indexers.
- We should not directly use `self.loc[key]` for list-like objects but rather handle them in a way that aligns with other indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above correction in the `_get_with` function, we ensure that list-like objects are handled correctly, resolving the issue when indexing a Series with a list key and avoiding the KeyError.
