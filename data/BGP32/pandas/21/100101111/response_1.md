### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of different types of indexers, particularly when a list indexer is used. The function does not correctly handle the case where a list indexer is passed, leading to inconsistent behavior. This inconsistency is highlighted by the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches`, where the function raises a `KeyError` for a list indexer.

The main issue arises from not properly identifying and processing the type of indexers being passed, resulting in incorrect behavior when dealing with list-like indexers.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, the function incorrectly identifies the key as a string while it should be treated as a list `['C']`.

2. In Case 2, the key is recognized as a string instead of an ndarray, causing type misinterpretation.

3. In Case 3, the function fails to handle the key type correctly and categorizes the key as a string rather than an Index.

4. In Case 4, it incorrectly identifies the key as a Series object instead of a string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to properly handle list-like indexers. Specifically, the function should correctly identify the type of the indexer being passed and process it accordingly. By ensuring consistent handling of different indexer types, the function should be able to return the expected results without raising errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected version above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle list-like indexers properly, passing the failing test case and aligning with the expected input/output values.
