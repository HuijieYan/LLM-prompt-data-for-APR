### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of the `key` parameter when it is of type `list`. In the case where `key` is a list, the function is not correctly processing it and leads to a KeyError, which causes the test to fail.

### Bug Location:
The bug likely occurs within the block that handles non-list-like key types. The issue arises when the function attempts to convert `key` to a list and further processing based on the converted type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` parameter is of type `list`, it is correctly processed to avoid the KeyError. By handling the list input properly within the function, the KeyError should no longer be raised.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles list-like `key` input, specifically addressing the error in processing lists that caused the initial KeyError. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected for list, ndarray, Index, and Series inputs, resolving the issue raised in the failing test case and the corresponding GitHub issue.
