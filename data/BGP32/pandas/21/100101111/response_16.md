## Explaining the bug
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas has a conditional block handling different types of `key` inputs for indexing. The issue arises when the `key` parameter is a list-like object, specifically a list, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. In the failing test, the `key` is transformed into a list-like object and passed to the Series, expecting it to raise a `KeyError` as seen in the test's assertion message. However, the function currently does not handle the case of a list key appropriately, leading to the KeyError not being raised as expected.

The issue mentioned in the GitHub report points out the inconsistency in how different list-like objects are handled for indexing Series, especially when a key with no matches is used. The inconsistency is observed between using a list key and other array-like keys.

## Fix strategy
To resolve this issue and make the function appropriately handle list-like objects as keys, we need to adjust the conditional blocks that check for different key types. Specifically, we need to ensure that when the key is a list-like object (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series), the function correctly raises a KeyError for cases where there are no matches found in the Series index.

## The corrected function
Based on the analysis and understanding of the bug and the failing test, here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if len(key) == 0 or not any(self.index.isin(key)):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, a check is added after converting `key` into a list if it is not already one. This check ensures that if the length of the key is 0 or none of the elements are present in the Series index, a KeyError is raised. This change aligns the function's behavior with the expectations set by the failing test and the GitHub issue reporting the inconsistency.
