### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key input for indexing a Series. However, the bug occurs when dealing with list-like key input, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of key inputs. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError during indexing, as seen in the failing test case.

The issue arises from the conditional checks in the function that mishandle list-like keys in a specific manner compared to other types like ndarray, Index, and Series.
The failing test case highlights the inconsistency when using list-like keys, where the KeyError is raised instead of handling the indexing gracefully.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the conditional path that processes list-like keys. This conditional path does not handle list-like keys correctly and leads to a KeyError in the failing test cases. The function's logic needs to be adjusted to maintain consistency in indexing behavior across different types of keys.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the conditional path for list-like keys should be adjusted to handle them in a way that aligns with the expected behavior. By ensuring that list-like keys are processed correctly, the function should provide consistent indexing behavior across various key types.

### Updated Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle list-like key differently for string type

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By introducing a specific handling for list-like keys when the inferred type is a string, the corrected function aims to align the behavior across different key types, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
