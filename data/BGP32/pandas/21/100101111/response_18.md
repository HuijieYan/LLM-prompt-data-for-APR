### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling list-like keys correctly and is leading to a KeyError in certain cases, as indicated by the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. The function improperly handles list keys when trying to retrieve values from a Series. The issue stems from the detection and handling of list-like keys and the conversion between different key types.

### Bug Cause
- The buggy function does not correctly handle list-like keys when accessing values from a Series.
- When the key is a list, the function incorrectly attempts to process it in a way that leads to a KeyError when attempting to access values from the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of keys, including list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
2. Correctly process list-like keys to prevent KeyErrors.
3. Improve the handling of different key types to avoid misinterpretation of the key data.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of the Changes
- The correction includes explicitly converting the key to an Index using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent handling.
- The function now properly processes list-like keys to prevent KeyError issues when accessing values from the Series.
- The key type detection and handling have been improved to avoid misinterpretation of the key data.

By applying these changes, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the failing test, aligning with the expected input/output values and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
