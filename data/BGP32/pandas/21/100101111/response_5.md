### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of indexers like list, ndarray, Index, and Series to retrieve elements from a Series object, but it fails when using a list indexer.
3. In all failing cases, the key is not found in the index, leading to a KeyError at the end of the function due to incorrect handling of list indexers.
4. The problematic code lies in the block that handles non-list indexers and falling back to positional indexing. The check for this fallback should be done before entering the non-list indexer block.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by handling non-list indexers before checking if the key is a list. This leads to incorrect handling of a list indexer key that is not found in the Series index. The program should ideally check if the key is a list before proceeding with the non-list indexer logic.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Move the check for list-like keys to the beginning of the function.
2. Only proceed with non-list indexer handling if the key is not list-like.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Default case for scalars
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making the necessary adjustments to the function, we ensure that list indexers are handled correctly and prevent the KeyError when a key is not found in the Series index.
