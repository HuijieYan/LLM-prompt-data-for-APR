### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of indexers that do not have any matches in the Series index. When a list is used as the key to index the Series, an inconsistent behavior occurs where a KeyError is raised for list indexers but not for other array-like indexers. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue mentioned.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to a specific check for the type of the key when it is a list. In the buggy function, the key is checked if it's not list-like and then proceeded to extract values from the Series based on the key type. However, for the list case, this check leads to a reindexing operation, causing the KeyError when no matches are found.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers to align with the behavior shown when using array-like indexers. This fix involves updating the logic that determines the appropriate action for list indexers to avoid raising a KeyError when no matches are found but instead returning NaN values similar to how array-like indexers operate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            # Handle the case of an empty list
            return self._constructor_s(index=self.index, data=[np.nan]*len(self.index))
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic for list indexers to handle the case of an empty list by returning NaN values aligned with array-like indexers, the function now maintains consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
