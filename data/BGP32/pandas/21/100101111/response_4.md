### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, and lists. 
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes list-like indexers, which are being treated differently from other types of indexers like arrays, indexes, and series.
3. In the failing test, the test case uses a list-like indexer `key` composed of a single element `C` that is not present in the series index, resulting in a KeyError. The current implementation is inconsistent in how it handles different types of indexers, leading to unexpected behaviors in list indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all indexers are treated consistently and that the behavior of list-like indexers is aligned with other indexers like arrays, indexes, and series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers.
2. Refactor the conditional logic to make the behavior of processing list-like indexers consistent with other indexer types.
3. Ensure that the function returns the expected output for all types of indexers, including lists.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Always convert list indexer to array to ensure consistent behavior
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustment to ensure that list indexers are converted to arrays consistently with other indexers, the updated function should now handle list-like indexers correctly and pass the failing test cases.
