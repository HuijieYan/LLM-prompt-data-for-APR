### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` has a problem with how it handles different types of indexers. When the function receives a list-like key, it fails to handle it correctly, resulting in an incorrect behavior that leads to a `KeyError` when accessing the Series with that key.

The function incorrectly categorizes the key as not list-like and tries to access the value directly, causing the `KeyError` to be raised. This issue is further compounded by not properly distinguishing between different types of indexers, such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys, specifically differentiating between list, ndarray, Index, and Series types. We should treat list-like keys consistently to avoid raising a `KeyError` when accessing the Series.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly check if the key passed to the function is list-like using the `is_list_like` function. If it is, we convert it to a list before proceeding with further checks and indexing. This modification helps in ensuring consistent handling of different types of keys and thereby resolves the `KeyError` issue.
