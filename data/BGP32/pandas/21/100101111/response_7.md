### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key input for indexing a Series. However, there is a bug in the handling of `list` type key input, causing unexpected behavior and KeyError as seen in the failing test cases.

The key issue arises when a `list` key is passed to the function for indexing. In such cases, the code path for handling `list` key does not align with the expected behavior, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The function checks if the key is not list-like with `elif not is_list_like(key)`, although `list` is list-like, leading to incorrect branching.
2. The function assumes that a `list` type key can always be cast into a list using `key = list(key)`, which may cause issues with keys that cannot be directly converted to a list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Correctly handle the `list` key case and align the behavior with other types of key inputs.
2. Avoid unnecessary conversion of the `list` key to a list if it's already list-like.
3. Ensure that the indexing behavior for `list` type key is consistent with other indexers like `np.ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like key first before handling specific types
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Directly use key if it is already list-like
        pass
    else:
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like key to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments outlined in the corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now handle `list` type keys correctly, passing the failing tests and aligning with the expected behavior.
