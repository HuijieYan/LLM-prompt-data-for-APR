### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. It categorizes the key type and then executes specific operations.
2. The bug arises when handling a key that is of type `list`. It fails to process the list key correctly compared to other types like `array`, `Index`, or `Series`.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is expecting KeyError when trying to access an element that is not present in the Series using different indexer types. However, the buggy function does not handle the `list` type properly, leading to the wrong behavior and the test failure.
4. To fix this bug, the handling of a key of type `list` needs to be adjusted to match the expected behavior when accessing an element not present in the Series.
5. The corrected version of the function should address the issue by correctly handling the list type key to align with the behavior of other indexer types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the specific block of code responsible for handling the key if it is of type `list`.
2. Modify the logic to make sure that the behavior for the `list` key type is consistent with other indexer types, producing the KeyError when the element is not found in the Series.
3. Verify the changes by running the failing test to ensure the bug is fixed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # Fix: Adjust the behavior for list key type

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the code for handling the `list` key type as shown above, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and behave consistently with other indexer types.
