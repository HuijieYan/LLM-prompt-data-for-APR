### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there is an inconsistency in how list-based keys are handled compared to other types like arrays, Index, and Series. In the failing test scenario, when using `ser[list(key)]` to index a Series `ser` with a list key `['C']`, the function raises a KeyError while it should return `NaN` similar to how it handles other types of keys. This inconsistency is the cause of the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-based keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers like arrays, Index, and Series. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to cover list-like keys and make them behave similarly to other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_index_like(key):
        result = self.loc[key]
        if result.shape != key.shape:
            return self.reindex(key)
        return result

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional check for list-based keys, specifically adding a check for `is_index_like(key)`, which helps to ensure the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers. This correction addresses the inconsistency identified from the failing test scenarios.
