### Analysis:
1. The `buggy function` `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs like slice, dataframe, tuple, and various other types for indexing a Series.
2. In the failing test case, a Series object with a key containing a value that is not present in the index is used to demonstrate the issue.
3. The bug occurs due to the handling of key types, especially list-like key inputs where the error message is not consistent.
4. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
5. The function fails to handle list-like key inputs properly, resulting in a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the buggy function, when the key is a list-like object, the function tries to perform reindexing, leading to a KeyError if the key is not found in the index.
2. The check for list-like key is causing the issue as it differs from the handling of other array-like key inputs.
3. The function does not handle the list key input correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other key types.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the handling of list-like key inputs to align with the treatment of other array-like key inputs like np.ndarray or Index.
2. Ensure that the error message is consistent for all types of key inputs when the key is not found in the index.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like key inputs and ensuring conversion to Index type when needed, the function will now correctly handle different key types and provide consistent error messages.
