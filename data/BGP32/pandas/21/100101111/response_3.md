### Bug Explanation:

The bug lies in the `_get_with` function inside the `pandas/core/series.py` file. When dealing with a key that is a list, the function does not handle it correctly which leads to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects. This inconsistency results in a KeyError being raised for the list case while the other indexers work as expected.

### Bug Location:

The issue arises when checking for the type of the key and how it is handled, specifically in the condition checking whether the key is a list.

### Fix Strategy:

To fix this bug and make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers, we need to ensure that the list case is handled properly and does not result in a KeyError. We can modify the condition for a list key and update the logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list key properly without causing KeyError
        if len(key) == 0:
            return key
        key_state = self._get_value_indexer(key)
        return self._get_values(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a specific check for the list key type, which ensures that it is handled properly without leading to a KeyError. It provides a consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
