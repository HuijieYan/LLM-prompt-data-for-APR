### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of index keys for a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that doesn't match any index values.
3. The bug occurs when the key is passed as a list, causing the function to attempt to reindex the Series with that list key, which triggers a KeyError even if the key is not found in the index.
4. The bug is identified in the block of code where the function attempts to reindex with a key that is not found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function tries to reindex the Series with a key when that key is passed as a list, leading to a KeyError even if the key doesn't exist in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to avoid the reindex operation with a key that doesn't exist in the index when the key is passed as a list.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and all(elem in self.index for elem in key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- Modified the last conditional block to check if all elements in the key list exist in the Series index before attempting to reindex.
- This change ensures that the Series is only reindexed with a list key if all elements in the key list are present in the index, preventing a KeyError when reindexing with a non-existing key.

After applying this correction, the function should now appropriately handle reindexing with a list key, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.
