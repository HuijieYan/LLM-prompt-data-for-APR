### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file fails to handle the case where the key is a list containing no matches in the index.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file demonstrates the issue by passing a key that contains no matches in the Series index.
3. The function misidentifies the key type as `'string'` instead of correctly recognizing it as a list when no matches are found in the index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series that has no matches in the index.


### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of a key that is a list with no matches in the Series index. When this condition is encountered, the function wrongly identifies the key as a `'string'` type instead of recognizing it as a list. This misclassification leads to the failure to handle the case correctly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access non-existent values from the Series.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to properly identify and handle the case where the key is a list with no matches in the Series index. The key type should be accurately determined as a list, enabling the function to handle this scenario by returning an appropriate result without raising a KeyError.


### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the case where list with no matches
        key_values = [k for k in key if k in self.index]
        return self.loc[key_values]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where the key is a list with no matches in the Series index, returning only the values that exist in the index and avoiding the KeyError. This fix aligns the function's behavior with the expected outcome in the failing test.
