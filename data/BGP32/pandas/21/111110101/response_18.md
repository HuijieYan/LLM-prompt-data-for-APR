### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The bug is likely related to how the function handles the key parameter when it is not a list-like object (e.g., scalar values).
3. The failing test is trying to index a Series object with a key that does not match any values in the index, resulting in a KeyError not being raised as expected.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When the key is not list-like and does not match any values in the index, it should raise a KeyError according to the test, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle non-list-like keys that do not match any values in the index. We need to ensure that a KeyError is raised in such cases.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a try-except block to catch the KeyError when trying to access `self.loc[key]` with a non-list-like key, we ensure that a KeyError is raised when the key does not match any values in the index. This change should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
