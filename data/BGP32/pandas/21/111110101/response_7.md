Based on the analysis and the test cases provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles the key parameter passed to it. The function fails to correctly determine the type of the key passed, leading to incorrect handling of different types of keys, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key parameter and handles each type appropriately. By modifying the key type checks and retrieval logic, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        # For scalar or non-Series objects
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = [key]
    
    if is_extension_array_dtype(key) or is_categorical_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # For other cases, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects
    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of keys passed to it and return the expected results for all input cases provided in the failing test scenarios.
