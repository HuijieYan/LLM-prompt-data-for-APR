### Fixing the bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, causing the function to try to access the value using `.loc`. To fix this, we need to modify the condition where the function checks if the input `key` is list-like.

Based on the expected input/output values, we can conclude that the `key` parameter should always be treated as a list-like object, and we should retrieve the values using `.loc`. Therefore, we can simplify the code by directly using `self.loc[key]` if the input `key` is not recognized as list-like.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # treat the key as list-like and retrieve values using .loc
        return self.loc[key]
```

This correction ensures that the function always treats the input `key` as list-like and retrieves the values using `.loc`, as expected in the failing test cases.
