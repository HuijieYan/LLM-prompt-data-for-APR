Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object. The function incorrectly assumes that `key` is always a scalar value, leading to a KeyError when trying to index the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for checking if `key` is not list-like to also check if `key` is an instance of `Series`. If `key` is a Series, then we need to convert it to a list before proceeding with the indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle list-like objects, including Series, as the `key` parameter. This should address the KeyError issue and allow the function to pass the failing test cases with the expected input/output values.
