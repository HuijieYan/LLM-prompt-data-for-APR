### Code Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is used to retrieve values from the Series object based on the input key. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type. However, the bug occurs when the key is a list-like object, such as a pandas Series, array, Index, or list. The function mistakenly tries to access the `loc` attribute of the Series object directly in these cases, causing the KeyError.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when the key is a list-like object, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]` directly, assuming it's a scalar key value, which leads to a KeyError. Instead, it should handle these cases differently by returning `self.loc[key]` for keys that are not list-like objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like keys. The function should return `self.loc[key]` only if the key is not a list-like object. For list-like keys, the function should return `self.loc[key]` to handle the case appropriately.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys appropriately
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle scalar keys
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list-like keys by returning `self.loc[key]`, thus resolving the KeyError issue in the failing test cases mentioned above.
