### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when trying to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the index, which should raise a `KeyError`.
- The bug occurs when the key is a `Series` object, which is incorrectly handled in the buggy function causing it to return the wrong value and not raise a `KeyError`.

### Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the case when the key is a `Series` object in the `_get_with` function. The function incorrectly tries to handle the key as a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, or Index, leading to incorrect behavior and not raising the `KeyError` as expected.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when the key is a `Series` object by converting it to a list before proceeding to the indexing operation.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# corrected _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # convert single item to list
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By explicitly converting the key to a list when it's not list-like in the `_get_with` function, we ensure that the correct indexing logic is applied and the `KeyError` is raised appropriately when needed.
