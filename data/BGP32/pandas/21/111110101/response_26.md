## Bug Analysis

### Bug Location
The bug seems to be located in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, the issue arises when trying to index the Series with a key that is not found in the index.

### Bug Explanation
The failing test case is trying to index a Series `ser` with a key `key` that is not present in the index of the Series. The `_get_with` function is attempting to handle different types of keys, but it doesn't account for the case when the key is not found in the index. As a result, the function does not raise a `KeyError` as expected, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should check if the key is not present in the index before attempting to access the value from the Series. If the key is not found in the index, then a `KeyError` should be raised to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            if key not in self.index:
                raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            missing_keys = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
            raise KeyError(f"Keys {missing_keys} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle the case where the key is not present in the Series index and raise a `KeyError` as expected.
