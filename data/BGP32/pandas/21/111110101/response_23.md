### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalars. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input key when it is not of type list-like.

The failing test is trying to index a Series with a key that is not present in the index, and it expects a KeyError to be raised. The bug causes the function to not raise a KeyError when indexing with non-list-like keys correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the section of the function where it tries to handle non-list-like keys. The current implementation does not correctly handle non-list-like keys that are not recognized as scalars by the `lib.is_scalar` check. This leads to unexpected behavior when indexing with keys that are not in the index.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for handling non-list-like keys that are not recognized as scalars. We need to ensure that a KeyError is raised when indexing with keys that are not present in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if not self.index.isin([key]).any():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional logic to check if the key is present in the index when the key is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar. If the key is not found in the index, a KeyError is raised as expected. This change ensures correct behavior when indexing with various types of keys.
