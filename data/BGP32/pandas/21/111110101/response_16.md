Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. The function tries to determine the type of the key and then perform specific operations based on that type. However, for certain cases like when `key` is a list, there is a bug in the logic resulting in the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we can update the logic for handling the key as a list in the `_get_with` function. We need to ensure that we handle the case where `key` is a list appropriately by falling back to `self.loc[key]` as a default behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):  # Changed this condition to handle list-like keys
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):  # Moved this condition after handling list-like keys
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys properly, we should be able to fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test cases.
