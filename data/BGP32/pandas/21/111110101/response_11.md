The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key input parameter, which leads to unexpected behavior when trying to index the series. The function should properly check the type of the key and handle it accordingly to avoid errors.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the way the function checks and handles different types of keys. Specifically, we should ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key (list, ndarray, Index, etc.) and acts accordingly to perform the indexing operation.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, it should now properly handle different types of keys and perform the indexing operation as expected. This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test cases.
