### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle various types of input `key` for a Series object.
2. The error messages from the failing tests suggest that the current implementation is not handling certain cases correctly, leading to `KeyError` exceptions.
3. The function seems to incorrectly process key types like array, Index, and Series, resulting in unexpected behaviors.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers for a Series object.
5. The bug needs to be fixed to ensure that all types of inputs are processed correctly without raising errors.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug seems to stem from the way different key types are handled inside the `_get_with` function.
2. The function does not handle cases where the input key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series appropriately, leading to KeyErrors in certain scenarios.
3. The function also incorrectly infers the type of the key in some cases, leading to incorrect indexing operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the logic for handling different types of keys to ensure a consistent behavior for all types of inputs.
2. Correctly infer the type of the key and select the appropriate indexing strategy accordingly.
3. Update the function to accurately handle list, ndarray, Index, and Series key types without raising KeyErrors.
4. Ensure that the function returns the expected values for the given input scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the suggested fixes in the corrected version above, the function should now be able to handle various key types correctly and avoid the KeyError issues observed in the failing tests.
