### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` checks for the type of the `key` parameter and performs different actions based on the type.
2. The failing test cases provide a `key` parameter of various types: list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The error message indicates that the function fails to handle the case when a list type key is provided.
4. The expected behavior is that the function should handle all types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) consistently.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys, specifically the case of a list key causing an error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle list-like keys, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index the Series with a list key.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can handle all types of keys consistently, especially list-like keys. We should update the logic to correctly process list-like keys and avoid raising a KeyError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like keys in the same way as other types of keys, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide consistent behavior when indexing a Series.
