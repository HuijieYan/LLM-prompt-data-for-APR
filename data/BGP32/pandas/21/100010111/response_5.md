### Identification of potential error locations:
1. The condition `elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` might be problematic as it is intended to handle a wide range of possible key types but could cause unexpected behavior.
2. The check `if isinstance(key, Index)` may not cover all cases where `key` is an Index type, leading to improper handling.
3. The usage of `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` to determine `key_type` may not always produce the correct dtype inference.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises due to different behaviors for different types of indexers in the `ser[key]` operation. Specifically, when `key` is a list, it leads to a `KeyError` which contradicts the behavior for other indexer types. This inconsistency in handling different indexer types causes the failure in the test cases.

The bug is related to a GitHub issue where the behavior of `ser[key]` with various types of indexers should be made consistent to avoid misleading errors and maintain uniform behavior across different types of indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that all types of indexers, including list, array, Index, and Series, are handled consistently in the function.
2. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` to ensure accurate identification of integer and boolean indexers.
3. Address the specific issue related to list indexers causing a `KeyError` and adjust the behavior to align with other indexer types.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making adjustments in the handling of different indexer types and refining the logic for determining `key_type`, the corrected function should now provide consistent behavior for various indexer inputs and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
