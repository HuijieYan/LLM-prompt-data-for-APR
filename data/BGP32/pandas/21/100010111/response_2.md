### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs to retrieve values from a Series.
2. The error messages from the failing test indicate that the function is not handling list-like indexers properly.
3. The function fails to handle `list` type indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`. The expected behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series should be consistent.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and suggests aligning the behavior with the list case.
5. To fix the bug, the function should handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the condition for `is_list_like(key)` and ensure proper handling of list-like indexers.
2. Make the behavior consistent for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.
3. Implement the suggested changes based on the GitHub issue description.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is Index-like
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are consistently handled for list, ndarray, Index, and Series input types, as suggested in the GitHub issue. It also ensures that the key is converted to an Index-like object before further processing.
