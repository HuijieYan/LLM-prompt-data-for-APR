### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, there are some issues in how it processes the key and determines the `key_type`. The error messages from the failing tests indicate a problem related to the indexing behavior with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The function incorrectly handles certain cases, leading to KeyError exceptions.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect determination of `key_type`.
2. Inconsistent handling of different types of keys.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect determination of the `key_type` and inconsistencies in handling different types of keys. The function fails to properly process specific input types (e.g., list, Index) leading to KeyError exceptions during indexing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic for determining the `key_type` and ensure consistent handling of all types of keys. Additionally, we need to address the inconsistencies in behavior observed for different key types.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made
1. Updated the logic for determining `key_type` to handle different input types correctly.
2. Consolidated the handling of keys to ensure consistency across different types.
3. Fixed the issue causing KeyError exceptions for specific key types by addressing the inconsistencies.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests, satisfy the expected input/output values, and address the issue reported on GitHub.
