### Analysis
- The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for a Series object.
- The bug seems to occur when a key in the form of a list is provided.
- The error message indicates that a KeyError is not being raised as expected when indexing with a list.
- The function's logic for handling different key types needs to be reviewed and corrected.
- The expected input/output values are provided for multiple test cases, along with the corresponding types of variables.

### Bug Cause
- The bug stems from incorrect handling of key types, specifically when a list is provided as the key.
- The function should correctly handle list-like keys to avoid the KeyError raised during the test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Update the function to correctly handle list-like keys and ensure that a KeyError is raised when necessary.
- Review the conditions for different key types and address the specific case of a list key.
- Make sure the function correctly determines the key type and handles it appropriately.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case of a list-like key
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Ensure KeyError is raised when necessary
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to correctly handle list-like keys and ensuring that a KeyError is raised when needed, the bug should be fixed, and the function should pass the failing test cases.
