### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers for a Series.
2. The failing test cases involve passing different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to a Series and expecting specific error messages related to key not being found in the index.
3. The bug is causing the wrong error message to be raised when a list indexer is passed to the Series, leading to a test failure.
4. The bug might be related to how list-like indexers are handled compared to other types in the function.
5. The expected behavior is for list indexers to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers behave similarly to other types of indexers, such as ndarray or Index. We should modify the code related to handling list-like indexers to match the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key = key.to_list()  # Convert Index to list
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary adjustment in the handling of list indexers, the corrected function should now behave consistently across different types of input indexers and resolve the bug.
