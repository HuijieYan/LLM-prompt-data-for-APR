### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The function contains various if-elif-else blocks to check the type of key and perform corresponding operations.
3. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling all cases properly, especially when the key is of type `list`.
4. The expected cases provide input parameter values and types, along with the expected values and types of relevant variables at the function's return.
5. The GitHub issue highlights inconsistencies in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers, specifically for the `ser[list(key)]` case.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle list indexers, which leads to a KeyError when trying to access elements not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly and consistently with other types of indexers. Since the GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior, we should aim to make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function now properly handles list indexers by converting them to a list if necessary before performing the indexing operation. This should resolve the inconsistencies and ensure that the function behaves consistently across different types of indexers.
