### Analysis
1. The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases are focused on different types of indexers: list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError` related to index matching.
4. The function seems to have issues with handling different types of indexers, especially lists.
5. The GitHub issue points out an inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When encountering a list-like key, the function fails to properly handle it, resulting in a `KeyError` during indexing. This inconsistency is highlighted by the failing test cases and the GitHub issue. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series) are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should address the handling of list-like keys to avoid the `KeyError` issue.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys and ensuring consistency across different indexer types, the corrected function should address the `KeyError` issue and pass the failing test cases. The function now properly handles all types of indexers, aligning with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
