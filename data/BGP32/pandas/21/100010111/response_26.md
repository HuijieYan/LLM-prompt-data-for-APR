### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, list-like objects, and more for a Series.
2. The error message indicates that the behavior differs when indexing a Series with a list compared to indexing with other array-like objects.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like objects as keys, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
4. The function needs to be modified to consistently handle list-like objects as keys and avoid the KeyError issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling list-like objects as keys in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the function fails to correctly handle list-like objects when used as keys for indexing a Series, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like objects consistently with other array-like objects. This involves checking the type of the key and treating list-like objects in a similar way as other array-like objects to avoid the KeyError issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Removed duplicate check for isinstance(key, list)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now handles list-like objects consistently with other array-like objects, resolving the KeyError issue when indexing a Series with list-like keys. This fix ensures a more uniform and reliable behavior across different types of indexers.
