### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
- The error messages indicate that the issue arises when trying to index a Series using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series containing values that are not present in the Series index.
- The function incorrectly handles the case when the key is a list, leading to a KeyError instead of returning NaN values for missing indexes.
- The bug is consistent with the described GitHub issue where different indexers behave inconsistently.
- The main cause of the bug is the mishandling of list-like keys when indexing the Series.

### Bug Cause:
- As per the buggy function, when processing a list-like key that contains values not present in the Series index, the function attempts to use the key for indexing directly, leading to a KeyError if any index is missing.
- The intended behavior for list-like indexers is to return NaN values for missing indexes, similar to how ndarray or Index indexers behave.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the part of the function responsible for handling list-like keys to ensure that missing indexes result in NaN values instead of raising a KeyError.
- Ensure consistency in the behavior when indexing with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to address the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.values

    result = self.reindex(key)
    if isinstance(result, Series):
        result = result.to_numpy()
    return result
```

By updating the function as shown above, it ensures that when indexing with list-like keys, missing indexes will result in NaN values instead of raising a KeyError. The corrected function addresses the inconsistent behavior reported in the GitHub issue and satisfies the expected input/output values.
