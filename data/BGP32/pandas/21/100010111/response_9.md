### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The error messages from the failing tests indicate issues related to key types like `list`, `ndarray`, and `Index`.
3. The expected input values include various types of keys like a list, an ndarray, and an Index. The function should determine the type of key and handle the indexing accordingly.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be in the handling of list-like key types, as indicated by the failing tests.
5. The bug leads to a KeyError when indexing using certain key types, such as list.
6. The bug is consistent with the reported GitHub issue where different indexers behave inconsistently.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the key type at the beginning of the function and handle different types appropriately.
2. Ensure that the function correctly identifies and processes list-like key types to avoid the KeyError.
3. Handle different types of keys such as list, ndarray, and Index in a consistent manner.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle different types of key for indexing
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        key_list = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_list, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_list = key
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key_list]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key_list]

    # Handle Index type key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    # Handle list-type key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key_list]

    return self.reindex(key_list)
```

This corrected version checks for list-like keys properly and processes them accordingly to avoid the KeyError. The function now handles different types of keys consistently based on the input provided in the failing tests.
