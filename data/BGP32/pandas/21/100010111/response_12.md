### Analysis:
1. The `ser[key]` operation is raising a `KeyError` when a list is used as the key parameter, but not when other data types like ndarray, Index, or Series are used.
2. The function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of input keys, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc., but is not handling the case of a list properly.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between using a list as an index and other data types.
4. The key issue seems to be in the handling of a list as an index in the `_get_with` function.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when a list is passed as the index key, the check for `is_list_like(key)` returns true, but the subsequent handling of list type is not done correctly. This leads to the KeyError in the failing test cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list is passed as an index key, it is handled properly and the behavior remains consistent with other data types like ndarray, Index, and Series. This can be achieved by updating the conditional statements to correctly handle the list input.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Series):
        # Check for Series type as well
        key = pd.Series(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if the input key is a Series type and handling list type input correctly, the fixed function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other data types, resolving the KeyError issue in the failing test cases.
