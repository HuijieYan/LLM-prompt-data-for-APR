## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to handle different types of input `key` and return the corresponding values based on its type. However, the bug occurs when the function encounters `key` of type `Index` and `list`. It fails to handle these types correctly, causing the function to return incorrect results or raise errors.

The error messages suggest that the issue is related to handling the `key` parameter when it is of type `Index`, `ndarray`, or `Series`. The expected behavior is to return `NaN` for keys with no matches, but the function is not handling these cases properly.

Based on the GitHub issue, there seems to be inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are treated, especially when using `list` as an indexer. The bug relates to handling list indexers different from array-like indexers, which results in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function failing to properly handle `key` of type `Index`, `list`, and other array-like types. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to index the Series based on these key types. The issue is related to inconsistency in how different types of indexers are processed within the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function `_get_with` correctly handles different types of indexers like `Index`, `list`, `ndarray`, and `Series`. The aim is to provide consistent behavior regardless of the type of indexer used, especially when no matches are found in the index. By addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue, we can improve the function's overall behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_object_dtype(self.index):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added a condition to handle `Index` type specifically to ensure consistent behavior when indexing the Series. Additionally, we have included a check to convert the key to an index if the index of the Series is of object type. These changes aim to address the bug by providing correct handling of different types of indexers. Now, the function should pass the failing test cases and behave as expected based on the given inputs.
