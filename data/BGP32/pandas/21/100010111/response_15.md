### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs while indexing a Series. The function should return the desired subset of the Series based on the input `key`. However, the function has a bug that is causing the test cases to fail, resulting in a `KeyError` because it is not handling the different types of `key` consistently.

### Potential error locations
1. The bug might be related to how the function is handling different types of `key` inputs.
2. The function might not be correctly converting certain types of `key` inputs to a common form for processing.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function is designed to handle multiple types of `key` inputs like lists, arrays, indexes, etc. The bug occurs when a `key` input that is cast to an `Index` object triggers a `KeyError` due to inconsistencies in how different types of `key` inputs are being handled. This inconsistency results in a failure to match the keys and thus raises a `KeyError` as seen in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function consistently handles all types of `key` inputs. This can be achieved by standardizing the processing of different types of `key` inputs before attempting to index the Series. Additionally, the function should handle the `key` input in a manner that aligns with the expected behavior when indexing a Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index type for consistency
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle cases where key is neither list nor integer
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that different types of `key` inputs are consistently handled and processed appropriately, this corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases.
