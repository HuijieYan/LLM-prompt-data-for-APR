### Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
- The function encounters an issue when the key is a list-like object, leading to a `KeyError` during the test execution.
- The issue is related to how different types of key objects are handled in the function, specifically when the key is a list-like object.
- The function should correctly identify the type of the key object and process it accordingly to avoid errors.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements that are not in the index.
- The function mistakenly treats list-like keys differently from other types of keys, causing inconsistencies in behavior and failing the test case.

### Fix Strategy
- Update the conditional statements in the function to correctly identify and handle list-like keys in the same manner as other types of keys.
- Ensure that the function processes all types of keys consistently to avoid errors and maintain expected behavior.
- Handle the case of list-like keys by reindexing the Series with the key to align the index correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the function `_get_with` now handles list-like keys consistently with other types of keys, avoiding the `KeyError` issue during the test execution. By ensuring that all types of keys are processed uniformly, the function maintains expected behavior and fixes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
