### Analyzing the buggy function and the error message

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to process different types of indexers passed to a Series object. The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior of `ser[key]` is inconsistent when `key` is a list, compared to when `key` is an ndarray or a Series. The error message specifically complains about not finding any matching values from the index, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. Handling of different types of `key` in the series indexing.
2. Incorrect inference of the `key_type`.
3. Different treatment for list-like indexers compared to other types.

### Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers (`key`) compared to ndarray or Series indexers within the `_get_with` function. The function should treat list indexers the same way it treats ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with ndarray, Index, and Series indexers. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the `_get_with` function to treat all these indexers in a similar manner.

### Corrected version of the function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure all different types of indexers are treated consistently, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values as described for each case.
