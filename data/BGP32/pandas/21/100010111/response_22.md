### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys for indexing a Series object.
- The failing test is trying to index a Series using different types of indexers - list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
- The error message indicates that the KeyError is raised when using a list indexer which is inconsistent compared to other types of indexers.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug occurs when handling a list indexer in the `_get_with` function.
- The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when indexing a Series using a list indexer.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in treating list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- The function should handle list indexers in the same way as it handles other types of indexers when indexing a Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.
- Ensure that the handling of list indexers is aligned with the behavior of other indexers to prevent KeyError from being raised in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers when indexing a Series object. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
