### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for a Series object. The error messages provided in the failing tests indicate that the function is not handling Index objects correctly. Additionally, the expected types and values of variables before the function's return are not being met.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Handling `key` as an Index object is causing issues.
2. The logic of deciding whether to treat the key as positional or label-based might not be working as expected.
3. Handling the key as a list might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from the function not correctly handling Index objects as keys. It fails to identify the key as a valid part of the index, resulting in a KeyError during the tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that Index objects are handled properly.
2. Verify the logic for deciding between positional and label-based indexing.
3. Consistently handle different types of keys to prevent KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_inferred_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = key_inferred_type

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling Index objects correctly and making adjustments in the logic for different key types, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values.
