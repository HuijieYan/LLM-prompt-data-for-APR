### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series.
- The error message indicates that the test is failing when attempting to access elements in the Series using different types of indexers.
- The expected behavior is consistent for list, ndarray, Index, and Series input types when indexing a Series.
- The bug seems to be related to different handling of indexers within the function.
- The key issue seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior between list, ndarray, Index, and Series used as indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of input `key` when indexing a Series.
- The function does not treat list-like input keys (`list`, `np.array`, `Index`, `Series`) consistently, leading to unexpected behavior and failing tests.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the function `_get_with` to handle list-like input keys (`list`, `np.array`, `Index`, `Series`) uniformly by using common indexing logic.
- Ensure that the function behaves consistently for all types of input keys.
  
### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to uniformly handle list-like input keys (`list`, `np.array`, `Index`, `Series`) using common indexing logic, the corrected version should pass the failing tests and behave consistently for all types of input keys.
