### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is attempting to handle different types of input keys such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc. and return the corresponding output based on the type.
2. The error message indicates that the function fails when accessing a Series using a key that does not exist in the index. This issue is related to how the function processes different types of input keys and how it handles error checking.
3. The bug is likely caused by the specific handling of different types of indexers and the inconsistency in error checking between array-like indexers and list indexers. The function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are treated consistently when accessing the Series and that proper error checking is in place to handle cases where the key does not exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle list indexers in a similar way to array-like indexers to ensure consistency.
2. Implement proper error checking for list indexers to avoid KeyError when the key does not exist in the index.
3. Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability.
4. Ensure that the function returns the correct output for all types of input keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    # Infer the type of the key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list indexers properly to avoid KeyError
        indexer = self.index.get_indexer_for(key)
        if np.all(indexer == -1):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self._get_values(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and includes proper error checking for list indexers to avoid KeyError when a key does not exist in the index. It should pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
