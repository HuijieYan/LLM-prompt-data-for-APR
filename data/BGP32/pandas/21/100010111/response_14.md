### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys like slices, dataframes, tuples, etc. and return the appropriate subset of the Series. 
- The error message from the failing test indicates a KeyError, implying that the function is not handling the input key properly in certain situations.
- The expected input parameters, like different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series), are not being properly processed by the function, leading to the KeyError.

### Error Cause:
- The function does not handle the case of a list-like key properly, resulting in a KeyError during the test execution.
- It expects the key to be of a specific type like list, ndarray, Index, or Series, but there is a discrepancy in key processing for different types of inputs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the function logic to properly handle list-like keys to avoid the KeyError during the test.
- Ensure that the function can handle various input key types consistently and return the correct subset of the Series.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the function as shown above, we ensure that the function properly handles list-like keys and prevents the KeyError during the test execution. The adjustments made in the logic allow for consistent processing of different types of input keys in all scenarios.
