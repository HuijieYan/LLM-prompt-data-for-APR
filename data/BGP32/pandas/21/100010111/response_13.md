### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values from the Series object.
2. The error messages from the failing test indicate a `KeyError` when trying to access an index that is not present in the Series.
3. The function fails to handle the case when a `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` key is passed.
4. The expected input/output values for the failing test cases are provided, indicating the expected behavior and types of variables.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially with lists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function `_get_with` is due to incorrect handling of the different types of key inputs, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access an index not present in the Series. The function fails to properly handle lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the different types of key inputs (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and returns the correct values without raising a `KeyError`. By following the expected input/output values for the failing test cases and addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue, we can correct the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle list, ndarray, Index, and Series key inputs, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases, satisfy the expected input/output values, and resolve the inconsistency identified in the GitHub issue.
