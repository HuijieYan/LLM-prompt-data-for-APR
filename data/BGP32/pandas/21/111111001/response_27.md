The issue in the buggy function lies in the logic for handling the key parameter, especially when it is not list-like (e.g., when it is an ndarray, Index, or Series). The function is trying to infer the type of the key and perform different operations based on that inference, but the handling is incorrect.

The buggy function fails the test because it does not handle the case where the key is an Index object properly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access the key from the Series object.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling different types of keys, ensuring that Index objects are properly processed.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle Index objects and pass the failing test cases.
