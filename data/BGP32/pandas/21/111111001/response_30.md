Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing tests, the issue seems to be with the handling of the key value when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series in the `_get_with` function. The function is incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `'string'` for all these types of inputs, leading to the KeyError when trying to access the key in the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different types of keys and ensure that the key is processed correctly based on its type. We can also consider updating the way the key type is inferred to avoid the incorrect behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        if is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
        else:
            key = [key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
    
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles different types of keys appropriately and correctly infers the key type based on the input key type.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing tests without raising a KeyError.
