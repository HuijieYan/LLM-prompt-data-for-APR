### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, the bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like type, causing an error when accessing the value. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all the failing cases, which leads to the error.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly inferring the key_type as `'string'` for non-list-like keys, leading to the wrong path being taken during indexing. This causes the code to raise a KeyError when trying to locate the value in the Series object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify non-list-like keys and handle their indexing appropriately. We should ensure that non-list-like keys are correctly treated as scalars and accessed using the `loc` attribute to prevent the KeyError from being raised.

### Corrected Version
I will address this bug by first identifying non-list-like keys and then using the `loc` attribute to access the corresponding value. I will provide corrections within the `_get_with(key)` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Check for slice objects
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Raise an error for DataFrame keys
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    # Check for tuple keys
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle non-list-like keys as scalars
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other types of keys appropriately
    else:
        key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With these corrections, the function should be able to accurately handle non-list-like keys when indexing a Series object.
