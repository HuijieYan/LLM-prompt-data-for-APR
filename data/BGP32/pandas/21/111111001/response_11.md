The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the key being converted into a list when it's already a pandas Index object. This conversion causes the subsequent check for `key_type` to fail, leading to an incorrect branch being taken in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key is not converted to a list unnecessarily. We can achieve this by adding a check to skip the conversion if the key is already an instance of the `Index` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = getattr(key, "inferred_type", lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False))
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this modification, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle Index objects without converting them to a list unnecessarily, resolving the bug and passing the failing test cases.
