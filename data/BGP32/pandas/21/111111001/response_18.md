### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of input types. The function checks if the `key` parameter is a list-like object, and if not, attempts to use it as a label for indexing. However, in the failing test cases, the `key` input is a list, an ndarray, an Index, or a Series, all of which are list-like types. The function incorrectly identifies these list-like types as scalars and tries to access them as labels using `self.loc[key]`, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional checks to properly handle list-like objects as expected. We should differentiate between list-like types and scalar types in the `key` parameter and adjust the implementation accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            key = list(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By modifying the check for list-like objects and distinguishing between scalars and list-like types, this corrected version of the `_get_with` function should properly handle the input types encountered in the failing test cases.
