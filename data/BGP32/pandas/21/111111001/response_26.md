### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` receives a key that is not recognized as a list-like object, leading to an incorrect handling of the key. This results in the KeyError being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the failing test, the input key is passed as a list-like object, but the function checks if the key is not a list-like object before proceeding with indexing.
2. The bug happens because when the function encounters a key that is not list-like but still iterable (like a pandas Series or Index), it incorrectly processes it as if it were a scalar value.
3. As a result, the code path that should handle such iterable keys is not triggered, leading to a KeyError being raised when attempting to access the key in the Series.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking for list-like objects to include pandas Series and Index as valid types of keys for indexing. We should also handle these cases appropriately by returning the values indicated by the keys.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition to include `isinstance(key, (Series, Index))`, we can ensure that Series and Index objects are treated as valid keys for indexing in the Series. This fix should allow the function to handle iterable keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
