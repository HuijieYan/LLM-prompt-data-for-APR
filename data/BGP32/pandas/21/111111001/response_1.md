### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The bug arises when the function attempts to handle different types of keys, specifically when the key is not list-like. In such cases, the function attempts to access the key using `self.loc[key]` which leads to a KeyError because the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Explanation:
The failing tests provide various types of key inputs to the `_get_with` function, such as lists, numpy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. In each case, the key is not found in the index, which leads to a KeyError when trying to access the key using `self.loc[key]`.

Additionally, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` for all inputs, which causes the function to incorrectly treat the key as an index label and try to access it using `self.loc[key]`, leading to the KeyError. This behavior is not desirable, especially when dealing with non-list-like keys.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle non-list-like keys when they are not present in the index. We should adjust the approach based on the type of key provided, ensuring that the KeyError is not raised when the key is not found in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, bool, int)):
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in index")

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles non-list-like keys and raises a KeyError with a meaningful message when the key is not found in the index.

With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing tests.
