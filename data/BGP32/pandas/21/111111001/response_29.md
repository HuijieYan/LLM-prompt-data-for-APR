### Analysis:
1. The `Series._get_with()` function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series of non-existent values in the Series. The function incorrectly assumes the key type is 'string' in such cases.
3. The function fails to handle cases where the key provided is not present in the Series index, leading to a KeyError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle cases where the key is not found in the Series index.
5. We will update the function to properly check for key existence in the Series index before attempting to access it.

### Solution:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is in the index
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in the index")
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        for k in key:
            if k not in self.index:
                raise KeyError(f"'{k}' not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    for k in key:
        if k not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"'{k}' not found in the index")
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function includes checks to ensure that the key is present in the Series index before attempting to access it. This should prevent the KeyError that was occurring in the failing tests.
