The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the incorrect handling of the key parameter in the presence of different data types. The function doesn't properly differentiate between different types of input keys and fails to handle them appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements and the logic to handle each data type correctly. We should also ensure that the key_type variable is properly determined based on the key's data type. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except (KeyError, IndexError):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version will properly handle the key input based on its data type and ensure that appropriate actions are taken for each case, including raising a KeyError if the key is not found in the index. This should resolve the issue with the failing test cases.
