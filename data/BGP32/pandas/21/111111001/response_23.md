### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing the tests due to a key error when indexing the Series with a key that is not present in the index. The key error occurs because the current code path does not handle the case when the key is not present in the index. 

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that when the key is not found in the index, the function doesn't handle this case properly and results in a KeyError. This can be seen in the failing tests where the key 'C' is not found in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case when the key is not present in the index. We should check if the key is present in the index before trying to access it and return an appropriate value or raise a KeyError if the key is not found.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
```

This corrected version checks if the key is present in the index before trying to access it using `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not found in the index, it raises a KeyError with an appropriate message. This will now handle the cases where the key is not present in the index and should pass the failing tests.
