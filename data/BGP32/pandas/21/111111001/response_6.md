Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue seems to be with the condition for handling `key` which is not a list-like object. The current implementation is trying to access the `key` directly using `self.loc[key]`, assuming that `key` is a valid index. However, in the failing test cases, `key` is a series object or an array which is causing the KeyError since it is not a valid index for the series.

To fix this bug, we should handle the case where `key` is not list-like separately and raise an appropriate error message or handle it in a different way. We can modify the implementation to check if the `key` is a Series or an array, and then handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif isinstance(key, (Index, Series, np.ndarray, list)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported type of key for indexing.")
```

This corrected version includes a more comprehensive check for different types of keys, ensuring that only valid index-like objects are used for indexing the series. This should address the KeyError issues observed in the failing test cases.
