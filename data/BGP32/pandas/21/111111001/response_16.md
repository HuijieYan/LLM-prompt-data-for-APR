Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how it handles different types of keys passed to it. The function seems to incorrectly handle the case where the key is a list-like object that includes a single element.

The bug originates from the conditional block where the function attempts to infer the data type of the key. In cases where the key is a list-like object containing a single element, the function incorrectly infers the type as 'string' (which is problematic) instead of 'object'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks the type of the key input. We can update the condition to check if the key is a scalar or a list-like object, and then use the `lib.infer_dtype` function to correctly infer the type of the key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle list-like objects containing a single element and infer the data type of the key appropriately. The corrected version of the function should pass the failing tests provided.
