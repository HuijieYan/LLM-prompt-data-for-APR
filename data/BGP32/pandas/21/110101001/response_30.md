## Bug Analysis

The `key` variable is being passed to the `_get_with` function in different types such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different operations accordingly. The bug seems to be in the handling of the `key` parameter when it is not a list-like object.

In the given test case, the `key` contains the value `['C']`. When this key is passed to the function, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` instead of handling it as a proper index lookup operation.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we should modify the logic for the cases where the `key` is not list-like. Instead of treating these cases the same way as a scalar value, we should handle them appropriately for index lookup.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle indexing case
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fall_back_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle the different types of `key` values and perform index lookup operations as expected. This updated version should pass the failing test cases.
