### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function is intended to handle different types of inputs for indexing a Series object. However, there is a bug in the code that causes it to incorrectly identify the type of input key, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.


### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly infers the key type when the key is a list or ndarray with a single element that is an object dtype. In such cases, it incorrectly infers the key type as 'integer' instead of 'string'. This leads to the function trying to index the Series using the wrong approach, resulting in a KeyError.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code that infers the key type for input keys. Specifically, when the key is a list or ndarray with a single element that is an object dtype, we should explicitly handle this case and infer the key type correctly as 'string'.


### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Explicitly handle list or ndarray with single element of object dtype
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if len(key) == 1 and is_object_dtype(key[0]):
            key_type = 'string'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including the explicit handling of the case where the key is a list or an ndarray with a single element of object dtype, the corrected version of the function should now correctly infer the key type as 'string' and behave as expected in the provided failing tests.
