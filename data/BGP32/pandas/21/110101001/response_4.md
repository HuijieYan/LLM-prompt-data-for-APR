## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of keys for indexing a Series. Specifically, the bug fails to handle the scenario where the key is a scalar value wrapped in a list, ndarray, Index, or Series object. This leads to a key_type being incorrectly inferred as `'string'` when it should be handled as an `'object'` type.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to appropriately handle all scenarios when indexing with different types of keys. This includes properly identifying scalar values and handling them appropriately, ensuring that the key_type is accurately inferred based on the key type. 

## The Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'floating']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles scalar values properly by checking if the key is a scalar using the `is_scalar()` function. It also ensures that the key_type is inferred accurately based on the type of key provided. Additionally, it properly distinguishes between integer, floating, and other types when deciding whether to use label-based or positional indexing.
