### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a pandas Series. The bug seems to occur when the key is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`. The function properly handles slice, DataFrame, tuple, and scalar keys.

Looking at the failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches`, it creates a Series `ser` with values `["A", "B"]` and then attempts to index it with a key that is not present in the Series. The key is created as a Series with a single value `["C"]` converted to different box types like list, np.array, Index, and Series. The test expects a `KeyError` when trying to access the Series with the non-existent key.

The bug seems to arise from the incorrect handling of keys that are not present in the Series when they are of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`. In the failing test cases, the key is not present in the Series index, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the handling of keys that are not present in the Series index when the key is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as "string" for these types of keys and does not raise a `KeyError` as expected when accessing a non-existent key.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the key type when it is a `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index`. We should explicitly check if the key is in the Series index and raise a `KeyError` if it is not present. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not key.isin(self.index).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix includes checking if the key is present in the Series index for `list`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, or `Index` keys and raising a `KeyError` if not found, ensuring correct behavior when accessing non-existent keys.
