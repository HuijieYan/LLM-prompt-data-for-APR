## Bugs in the Buggy Function
1. The function `_get_with` is not handling the case when `key` is a single-element list, ndarray, Index, or Series correctly. It is incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `"integer"` when it should be `"string"`.
2. The function does not differentiate between a key representing label-based indexing and positional indexing accurately, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Bug Explanation
In the failing test case provided, the key `key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)` is being passed to the function. Inside the function, the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `"integer"`, which is causing the function to branch into the wrong execution path. This incorrect inference results in a subsequent KeyError since the key `"C"` is not found in the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the type of the `key` input before inferring its type to handle the single-element case correctly.
2. Ensure that the function properly distinguishes between label-based indexing and positional indexing for strings.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the type inference and the handling of position-based and label-based indexing, the function should now behave correctly and pass the failing test cases.
