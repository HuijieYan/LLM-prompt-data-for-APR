## Bug Analysis
The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, in the current implementation, there is a bug related to handling keys that are not recognized properly based on their type. This bug causes the function to incorrectly identify the type of key input and results in errors when attempting to retrieve values from the Series.

- The key_type is being determined using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` for keys that are not recognized as common types like list, ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray, Series.
- Depending on the key_type inferred, the function tries to decide whether to treat the key as a positional indexer or label-based indexer, which is where the bug lies.

## Bug Explanation
1. When the key provided is a list-like or pandas Series, the function should be able to correctly identify the type and infer that it should use label-based indexing (`self.loc[key]`).
2. However, the current implementation fails to properly identify the `key_type` for list-like keys, resulting in the key_type being inaccurately assigned as `'string'`, leading to the function trying to access the values through incorrect indexing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug:
- We need to adjust the logic for identifying the `key_type` correctly based on the type of key input provided.
- For list-like keys or pandas Series keys, the function should infer the proper `key_type` as a label-based indexer to use `self.loc[key]`.
- Ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where the key input is not a common type like list, ndarray, Index, ExtensionArray, or Series.

## Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function should be able to handle different types of key inputs correctly and provide the expected behavior when indexing a Series using list-like inputs.
