The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from a misinterpretation of the key type when indexing the Series. The function incorrectly identifies the key type as `'string'` in all cases, which leads to the wrong path execution and ultimately causes the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should properly infer the key type and handle different types of keys accordingly. Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle other key types
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version:
- We correctly infer the key type using `key.inferred_type` for Index and Series objects.
- We handle integer and mixed-integer key types separately to decide between positional (`iloc`) and label-based (`loc`) indexing.
- Finally, we handle all other key types with `self.loc[key]`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing tests by correctly handling the different types of keys when indexing the Series.
