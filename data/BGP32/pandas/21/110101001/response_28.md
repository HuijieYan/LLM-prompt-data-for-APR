## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is not recognized as a list-like object or other specific types, leading to the function trying to access the `loc` attribute directly on the key, assuming it is a label-based positional index. This results in an incorrect key lookup and raises a `KeyError` instead of handling the key appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the key is treated correctly based on its type. We can handle different types of keys by checking their type and then accessing the values accordingly using the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`).

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self._is_label_or_positional(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating a check for different key types and ensuring the correct indexing method based on the key type, we can fix the bug and have the function handle keys appropriately. This update should pass the failing test case provided.
