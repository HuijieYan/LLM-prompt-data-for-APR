## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of various input types for the `key` parameter. The function is intended to perform different actions based on the type of `key`, such as slicing, indexing with a DataFrame, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc. However, the bug occurs when checking if `key` is a list-like object. If `key` is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar, the function tries to access the element at position `key` using the `loc` method, which results in a `KeyError`.

In the failing test, the `key` parameter is an ndarray of object dtype, which is not list-like according to the function's current implementation. As a result, the function tries to access an element using `loc[key]`, which raises a `KeyError` because ndarray indices are not valid for a Series.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of non-list-like and non-scalar `key` objects in the `_get_with` function. We should first check if `key` is an ndarray before any other checks and handle it appropriately. We can convert ndarray indices to a list before processing them to ensure compatibility with Series indexing methods.

## Corrected Version
```python
# Fixed version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we explicitly handle non-list-like `key` inputs by converting them to a list before further processing. This fix ensures that ndarray indices, such as the one in the failing test, are correctly handled by the function.
