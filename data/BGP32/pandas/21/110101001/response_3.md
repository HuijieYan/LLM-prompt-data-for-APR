### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the `key` parameter is not recognized correctly and leads to a KeyError when attempting to access the value in the Series. The function does not handle the key correctly when it is a list-like object, causing the KeyError to be raised.

1. The function checks if the `key` is a list-like object, but it fails to handle this case properly.
2. When the `key` is not recognized as a valid type (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index), the function attempts to convert it to a list but does not handle it correctly.
3. The function then tries to infer the dtype of the `key` to determine how to index the Series, but due to the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys, it fails to correctly infer the dtype.
4. This incorrect inference of the dtype leads to the KeyError being raised when trying to access the value within the Series.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that all cases of the `key` parameter are handled correctly. Specifically, we need to:
1. Update the logic to properly handle list-like objects as keys.
2. Handle the case when the `key` is not recognized as a valid type and convert it to a list appropriately.
3. Ensure that the dtype of the `key` is inferred correctly to determine how to index the Series.
4. Modify the return statement based on the type of `key` to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    # Infer the dtype of the key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these corrections, the `_get_with` function should now handle all types of keys correctly and avoid raising a KeyError.
