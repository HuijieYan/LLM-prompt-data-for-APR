The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of keys provided. The function fails to properly handle the case when the key is not list-like or when it is an index, which leads to the KeyError in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to enhance the logic for handling different types of keys, especially when the key is not list-like or when it is an Index type. We can improve the check for key types to ensure proper indexing behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "floating"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The key changes include:
- Using `ensure_index` to handle different types of keys and convert them into an Index type.
- Refining the key_type check to include "floating" as well.
- Adding a condition to properly handle keys of type Index.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now properly handle different key types and avoid the KeyError that was present in the failing tests.
