### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of key types when indexing a Series. The function is designed to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others. However, when a key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to handle it as a scalar key, leading to an incorrect indexing operation causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

Looking at the runtime values and types provided for the failing tests, we can see that in each case, the key is being incorrectly interpreted as a string (`'string'`) type instead of a list-like object. This incorrect inference of the key type causes the function to reach the `else` block and try to locate the key directly using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a `KeyError` because the key is not a valid index in the Series.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that all non-list-like keys are handled correctly and effectively fall back to the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) based on the key type. We should ensure that the key is correctly recognized as a list-like object so that the key type is inferred correctly and the proper indexing operation is performed.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that all keys are converted to a list if they are not list-like initially. We then correctly infer the key type and perform the indexing operation accordingly, either using `loc` or `iloc` based on the inferred key type. This adjustment should address the key errors and make the function behave as expected in the failing tests.
