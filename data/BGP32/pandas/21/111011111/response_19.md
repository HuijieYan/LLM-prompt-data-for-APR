The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the way different types of indexers are handled inconsistently. The function incorrectly handles list-like key indexers resulting in a Key Error when accessing the Series with a list key. To fix this bug, the function should handle list-like key indexers in a similar manner to other types.

The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and Key Errors. The suggestion is to make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like key indexers are treated consistently with other types, resolving the Key Error issue reported in the failing tests.
