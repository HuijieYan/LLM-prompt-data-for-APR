### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when accessing the Series with a list indexer. The issue arises due to different treatments for different types of indexers in the implementation, causing inconsistency.

### Bug Location:
The bug is in the section of code that checks for list-like indexers and tries to handle them appropriately based on their type.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when the key is a list-like object, the function incorrectly checks for specific types like `Index`, but fails to recognize list-like objects correctly, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly and consistently regardless of their precise type.
We should modify the code logic to correctly handle list-like indexers in a uniform manner to avoid the `KeyError` when accessing the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like indexers to be consistent with other types, the corrected function should now correctly handle list indexers without raising a `KeyError`.
