Based on the information provided, it is clear that the issue lies in how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexer inputs. The failing test cases involve `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` indexer types, and they are not being handled consistently, leading to a KeyError in the `ser[key]` operation.

The main cause of the bug is the inconsistency in how the different types of indexers are processed within the `_get_with` function, resulting in a KeyError when using a list as an indexer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) are handled consistently and correctly in the `_get_with` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all indexer types are properly handled and converted to a list type if necessary before being processed further. It should now pass the failing tests and address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
