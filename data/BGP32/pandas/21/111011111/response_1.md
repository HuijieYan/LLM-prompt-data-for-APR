To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to align the handling of different types of key input to ensure consistent behavior. Currently, the function encounters issues when dealing with list-like keys, resulting in a KeyError in certain scenarios. We will adjust the logic to handle list-like keys correctly and ensure they are processed in a consistent manner.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# corrected _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # handle individual scalar values not recognized by is_list_like
        return self.loc[key]
``` 

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are processed consistently by using `loc` indexing for that case. This adjustment resolves the KeyError issue for list-like keys mentioned in the failing test. Additionally, it makes the behavior consistent across different key types.

By making this change, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys properly and provide the expected output in all scenarios, as specified in the failing test cases.
