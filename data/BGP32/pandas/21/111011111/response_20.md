## Issue Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a `Series`.
2. The failing tests indicate that the case where `key` is a list is not handled correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The error message implies that treating `key` as a list index does not match the behavior of treating it like an ndarray or Index, leading to inconsistency in handling.
4. The expected behavior is for all 4 cases (list, array, Index, Series) to be treated consistently when indexing the Series.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the different handling of `key` when it is a list compared to other types like ndarray or Index. This leads to a `KeyError` in certain cases where the key is not found in the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of `key` is consistent across all input types (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The correction should ensure that the Series indexing behavior is consistent and does not raise a `KeyError` in any of the tested cases.

## Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Treat key as an ndarray for consistency in handling
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = np.array(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Handle key based on inferred dtype
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all different types of `key` are treated consistently when indexing the `Series`. By converting `key` to an ndarray if it is not already an array-like type, we ensure that the indexing operation behaves uniformly for all cases. This should resolve the inconsistency and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.
