Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the way indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, there is a discrepancy in the behavior when using different types of indexers, such as lists, arrays, and Index objects.

The bug arises when using a list indexer, where the function fails to handle the IndexError properly. This leads to a KeyError being raised incorrectly, causing the failing tests.

To fix this bug and align the behavior of different types of indexers, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly. We can achieve this by ensuring that list indexers are processed in the same way as other types of indexers. By treating list indexers similarly to arrays or Index objects, we can prevent the KeyError from being raised erroneously.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean" or key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these modifications in the `_get_with` function, we address the issue of inconsistent behavior when using list indexers. The corrected function should now handle list indexers appropriately and prevent the KeyError from being raised incorrectly, thus resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
