The issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in handling different indexers within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing unexpected behavior and failing tests.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. We can achieve this by modifying the condition checking for list-like objects, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the expected outcome for all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this adjustment, the function should now handle list, array-like, and other types of indexers consistently, resolving the errors reported in the failing tests. The corrected function aligns with the expected behavior based on the input types provided in the failing test cases.
