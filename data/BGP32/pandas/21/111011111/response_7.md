Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of indexers are handled. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, the key is not correctly processed, leading to a KeyError when accessing the Series.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for list indexers to ensure proper handling similar to other types of indexers. We can modify the final `if` block to explicitly handle list indexers and ensure that the key is processed correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
            # Handle both integer and boolean indexers
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            # Handle string indexers separately
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Default behavior if key is not recognized
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are processed correctly and mapped to the appropriate behavior based on the key_type. This approach is aligned with the handling of other types of indexers in the function and should resolve the KeyError reported in the failing tests.

Make sure to test the updated function with the failing tests to verify that the bug has been fixed and the expected behavior is achieved.
