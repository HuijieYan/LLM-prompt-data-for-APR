### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, etc., when indexing a Series object. The bug seems to be related to how it handles the key when it is of type `list`.
2. The failing tests indicate that when a key of type `list` is passed to the function, it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected result.
3. In all tested cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly assigned as `'string'`, which might be impacting the logic in the subsequent steps of the function.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how indexing with a list is handled compared to other array-like indexers. The goal is to align the behavior with list indexers to match the behavior with non-list indexers like arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function:
1. Correct the identification of the key type for `list` keys to avoid the KeyError and handle such cases appropriately.
2. Ensure that the key is processed correctly based on its type to provide the expected output.
3. Align the behavior of indexing with a list to match the behavior with other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "object":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Given the corrected function, it should now handle indexing with list keys properly and provide the expected output, resolving the issue raised in the failing tests and the GitHub discussion.
