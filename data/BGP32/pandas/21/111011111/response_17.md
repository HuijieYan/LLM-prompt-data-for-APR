The issue arises from the `_get_with` function's handling of different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function does not properly handle list indexers, leading to a KeyError when trying to access non-existent values.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly processes list-like indexers, resulting in an error when trying to access values that do not exist in the index. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that the function behaves consistently when dealing with different types of indexers, including lists. By adjusting the logic to handle list indexers properly, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers properly
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other types of indexers
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to correctly handle list-like indexers and ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, we can resolve the KeyError issue identified in the failing test cases.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output values, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
