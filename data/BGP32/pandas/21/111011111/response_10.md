Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue lies in the inconsistency between how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The GitHub issue also highlights this inconsistency and suggests that all indexers should behave like the list case.

To fix this bug, we need to make the behavior consistent for all types of indexers. Specifically, we should handle array-like indexers in the same way as list indexers to avoid the KeyError that is currently being raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently. It treats array-like indexers in the same way as list indexers to avoid raising a KeyError. With this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values as described.
