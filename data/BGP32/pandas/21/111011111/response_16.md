The issue stems from the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers in the `Series` class. The `ser[list(key)]` call triggers a `KeyError`, while similar calls with different types of indexers do not.

### Potential Error Locations
The bug might be stemming from the conditional logic inside the `_get_with` function where the code handles different types of indexers differently. Specifically, the issue likely arises when executing the block related to `not is_list_like(key)` for `list` type, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Explanation
In this buggy function, the function `_get_with` expects an `index-like` object `key` as a parameter. When `key` is a `list`, it directly tries to access the value by key. However, this operation causes a `KeyError` as list-like indexing is not supported directly. This behavior is inconsistent with other data types like arrays or indexes where the operation is allowed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure that when the `key` is a `list`, it is converted to an appropriate index-like object before attempting to access the value by key. One way to achieve consistency is to convert the `list` type indexers into a compatible type before processing them.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should fix the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert list-like key to Index
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that `key` is converted to a compatible type (such as an `Index`) when it is list-like, the corrected function should now handle lists consistently with other array-like indexers, addressing the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test cases.
