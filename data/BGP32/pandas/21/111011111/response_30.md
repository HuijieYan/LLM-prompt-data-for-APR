Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the cause of the bug is that when the `key` parameter is an array-like indexer in the form of a list, the function does not handle it properly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access elements in the Series. This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are treated.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list-like object, it is handled correctly to avoid the KeyError. We can modify the `_get_with` function to address this issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version will properly handle list-like objects as indexers, ensuring consistent behavior and avoiding the KeyError that was occurring in the failing tests. It aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
