Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, particularly when the indexer is a list. The error arises when attempting to access elements from the Series using a list-like structure. To fix this bug and ensure consistency across different types of indexers, we need to modify the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The key change made in the corrected function is the addition of a check for string indexer types, in addition to the existing check for integer types. This modification ensures that when the key is a list or array containing string values, the function uses label-based indexing (`self.loc`) instead of positional indexing (`self.iloc`).

By adding this condition and ensuring that appropriate indexing methods (`loc` and `iloc`) are used based on the type of the indexer provided, the bug related to list indexing should be resolved, leading to consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
