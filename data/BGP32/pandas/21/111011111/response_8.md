After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, we can see that the issue arises when using a list as an indexer in a Series, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to using other indexers like ndarray or Index.

The key insight here is that the `key` parameter in the buggy function is not properly handled when it is a list. The function tries to use `key` directly without converting it to an appropriate type before indexing the Series.

To fix this bug and align the behavior with other indexers, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list, it is converted to a suitable type before performing the indexing operation. We should handle list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers to provide consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    # existing class code...
    
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

By converting `key` to a list before performing the indexing operation, we ensure that list indexers behave consistently with other array-like indexers. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected in all cases.
