Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it results in a `KeyError` that is not consistent with the behavior of other indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other indexers. We can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, such as ndarray or Index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Treat list indexer consistently like other indexers
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fixed version ensures that list indexers are handled in the same way as other indexers, such as ndarray or Index, resolving the inconsistency and addressing the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing tests.
