### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where a list-like key is passed as an indexer correctly. When a list-like key is used, the function encounters an error due to the inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers.

### Bug Location
The bug is primarily located in the logic where the key is checked for being list-like and then handled accordingly. The current implementation does not handle the list-like key case appropriately, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the lack of consistent handling of different types of key indexers within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Since list-like keys are not properly processed, the function fails to return the correct result.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers. Checking if the key is list-like and treating it appropriately will address the issue and align the behavior with other indexer types.

### Updated Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys appropriately and pass the failing test cases.
