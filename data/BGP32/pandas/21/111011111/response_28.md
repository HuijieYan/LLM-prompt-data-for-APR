The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle list-like indexers properly, resulting in a `KeyError` in certain cases. The issue arises when passing a list as an indexer to a Series, causing inconsistent behavior compared to passing other types like an ndarray or Index.

The function incorrectly categorizes a list index as non-list-like, leading to incorrect handling. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are correctly processed within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix ensures that list-like indexers are correctly identified and processed within the `_get_with` function, preventing the `KeyError` issue experienced during testing.

By updating the handling of list-like indexers in the function, we align the behavior with other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
