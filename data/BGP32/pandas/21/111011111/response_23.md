### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. When using a list-like indexer (e.g., list, numpy array, Index, Series), the function incorrectly processes the key input, leading to a KeyError when trying to access values from the Series. This issue arises due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers.

Specifically, the function fails to handle list-like indexers appropriately, leading to a KeyError when trying to access values from the Series using the provided key. This behavior inconsistency with how other indexers are processed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other indexers in the `_get_with` function. This can be achieved by modifying the conditional branches for different types of key values to process list-like indexers correctly. By aligning the behavior of list-like indexers with other indexers, we can resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # All non-list-like indexers should go through loc to maintain consistency
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling list-like indexers
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Consistently decide between positional or label-based indexing
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function to align with the behavior of other indexers, the corrected version above should address the KeyError issues observed in the failing tests. This correction ensures consistent processing of different types of indexers, resolving the bug in the function.
