## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. The function is meant to handle different types of input keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, and others. However, when dealing with list-like keys, the function incorrectly tries to directly index the Series which results in a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other data types are handled and leads to failing tests.

In the failing test cases, when a list or ndarray key is used to index the Series, a `KeyError` is expected because the key doesn't exist in the Series index. However, the bug causes the function to raise the error when a list key is passed, but not when other types of keys are used.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should ensure that when a list key is provided, it should be handled in a consistent manner with other data types. This may involve adjusting the conditional branches to correctly process list keys before attempting to index the Series.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)

```

By updating the function to handle list-like keys consistently with other types, we ensure that the `KeyError` will be raised for all cases where the key is not found in the Series index, resolving the issue.
