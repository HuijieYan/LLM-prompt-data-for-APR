## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of key inputs, particularly the case when a list-like key is passed. The error message indicates that the behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series should be the same. Therefore, we need to ensure that the function appropriately handles list-like keys to avoid the `KeyError` raised during the failed tests.

To fix the bug, we should modify the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We can update the logic to treat list-like keys consistently, similar to how ndarray or Index keys are handled. This should prevent the `KeyError` from being raised when using a list-like key.

Let's provide a corrected version of the function below based on this bug fix strategy.
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments to the function, it should now handle list-like keys consistently with the behavior for ndarray or Index keys, addressing the inconsistencies and resolving the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing tests.
