## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, indexes, or Series. Specifically, when using a list indexer, the function incorrectly raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` for missing values, which is the desired behavior. This behavior inconsistency between different types of indexers causes the failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle list indexers similarly to array-like indexers by returning `NaN` for missing values instead of raising a `KeyError`. This change will align the behavior of different types of indexers, providing a consistent and expected output. We can achieve this by modifying the conditional block handling the list-like key case.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like key to return NaN for missing values
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized as list-likes
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, we ensure that list indexers return `NaN` for missing values, aligning them with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This fix resolves the issue observed in the failing tests and maintains consistency in handling different types of indexers within the `Series` class.
