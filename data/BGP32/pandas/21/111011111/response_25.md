### Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexers such as slices, tuples, and lists. The bug arises when a list-like object is passed as the key to index the `Series`. The function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers such as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects, leading to inconsistency in behavior.

When a list indexer is used, an error is raised with the message `"None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"`. This is due to the different handling of list indexers compared to other indexers like numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.

The expected behavior is to have consistent handling of indexers across different types, providing the same behavior for all array-like indexers. This consistency is crucial for user experience and ease of understanding when working with `Series` objects.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of indexers regardless of whether they are list-like, numpy arrays, or pandas Index objects. This can be achieved by modifying the code segment responsible for treating list-like objects differently from other array-like indexers.

We can update the section of the `_get_with` function that deals with list-like objects to follow the same path as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects. By doing this, we can ensure that all array-like indexers are handled consistently, addressing the inconsistency in behavior and resolving the error raised specifically for list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle all array-like indexers in a consistent manner
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key.inferred_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle all list-like objects in the same way as arrays and Index objects
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function now handles list-like objects the same way as numpy arrays or pandas Index objects, ensuring a consistent behavior for all array-like indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
