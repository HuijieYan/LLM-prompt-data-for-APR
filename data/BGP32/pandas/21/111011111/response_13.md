### Fixing the Bug

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from how different types of indexers are handled. The function should treat all types of indexers consistently to avoid unexpected behavior. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like indexer is passed to the function, it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers. The provided test case fails when using a list indexer, leading to a `KeyError`. We need to adjust the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, we ensure that the function handles list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This should resolve the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
