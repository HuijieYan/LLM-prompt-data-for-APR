### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of keys used for indexing a Series object. The issue identified on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list-like indexes compared to array-like indexes. The function currently doesn't handle list-like keys properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index with a list that contains no matches.

### Bugs:
1. The function does not handle list-like keys properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index with a list that contains no matches.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't correctly process list-like keys and doesn't fall back to positional indexing when needed, leading to the KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug, when dealing with list-like keys, the function should check for matches in the index and fall back to positional indexing if necessary to prevent KeyError from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert it to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Corrected: Added handling for scalar keys

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Corrected: Handling for scalar key when no match found

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By introducing proper handling for list-like keys, checking for scalar keys, and ensuring the key has the correct format using `ensure_index`, the corrected version of the function should now address the issue reported on GitHub, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
