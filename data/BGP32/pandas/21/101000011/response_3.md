### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers.

### Potential error locations:
1. The handling of key types using `is_list_like(key)` might be incorrect.
2. The distinction between different possible key types may not be accurately classified.
3. The decision-making logic for when to use `loc` versus `iloc` could be flawed.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the function `_get_with` treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers. It leads to inconsistencies in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue, the function should treat all indexers uniformly. This can be achieved by ensuring that list indexers are handled in a similar manner to other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        # Treat all key types uniformly
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, all types of key indexers are treated uniformly, ensuring consistency in behavior when indexing a Series. This resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue and makes the function more robust.
