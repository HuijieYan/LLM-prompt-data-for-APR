### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is responsible for indexing the Series object.
2. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers like list, array-like, and Index objects.
3. The bug occurs when a list indexer is used, resulting in a KeyError due to inconsistency in handling list indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of the code when handling different types of indexers. When a list indexer is passed, it results in the failure to find the values in the index, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the handling of list indexers to be consistent with other types of indexers. A strategy to fix this bug would involve updating the code to handle list indexers properly and ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code snippet now handles list and numpy array indexers correctly, ensuring consistency in behavior across different types of indexers. This updated version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
