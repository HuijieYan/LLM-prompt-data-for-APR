### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. The bug arises from inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency when using a list indexer compared to other types of indexers.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs when checking if the key is not list-like, then directly calling `self.loc[key]`, which results in inconsistent behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types. When indexing with a list, an error occurs because it directly tries to use `self.loc[key]`, which does not align with the behavior for other types of indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should handle list indexers in a consistent manner similar to array-like indexers. This means ensuring that indexing with a list does not raise an error and aligns with the behavior of other indexers.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar to a list to maintain consistency

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I addressed the inconsistency by converting the scalar key to a list before further processing. This ensures that indexing with a scalar will not raise an error and that the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers.
