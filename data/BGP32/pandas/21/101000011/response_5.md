### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas core is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled differently from array-like indexers, as described in the GitHub issue. The issue points out that the behavior of `ser[key]`, `ser[pd.Index(key)]`, and `ser[np.array(key)]` is consistent, but using `ser[list(key)]` results in a KeyError.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The code block where `if isinstance(key, list):` is handled can potentially cause the issue. The current implementation treats list indexers differently and returns `self.loc[key]`, which is inconsistent with other cases.
2. The condition where `key = list(key)` is applied can also be an error location, as it forces the key to be a list in all cases, which might not be the desired behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the implementation of `_get_with` does not handle list indexers in a consistent way with other types of indexers. Specifically, the behavior of returning `self.loc[key]` when `key` is a list causes a KeyError when the key does not match any index values. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and contradicts the behavior with other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, the handling of list indexers should be aligned with how other indexers are processed. It is essential to ensure consistency in the behavior of different types of indexers to maintain expected results. Adjusting the code to handle list indexers in a similar way to array-like indexers, as suggested in the GitHub issue, can help eliminate the inconsistency.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key] if all(self.index.isin(key)) else self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, handling list indexers has been updated to align with how other indexers are processed. The code now uses `self.iloc[key]` for list indexers if all index values are present to ensure consistent behavior and avoid raising a KeyError when the key doesn't match any index values. This adjustment should resolve the issue identified in the GitHub discussion.
