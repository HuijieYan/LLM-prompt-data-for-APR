### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of indexing inputs. The function has logic to differentiate between various types of keys like slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc., and perform appropriate actions based on the key type.

The GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers in the `Series` class. When a list key is passed for indexing a `Series`, it leads to an error due to the difference in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

### Identification of Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy function `_get_with` could be in how it handles list key types compared to other array-like key types. The issue arises when a list key is not properly processed and results in an error due to the indexing logic inconsistency.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the differentiation in handling list key indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The error occurs when a list key is passed, and the function does not process it correctly, leading to an inconsistent behavior with other typical indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure a consistent handling of list key indexers along with other array-like key indexers. The function should be modified to treat list keys similarly to other array-like keys to avoid the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have modified the handling of scalar key inputs to be consistent with other array-like key inputs. This change ensures that list indexers are treated similarly to other array-like indexers and no longer lead to errors or inconsistencies.
