### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. One key issue identified in the GitHub issue is the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of lists as key inputs.
2. Differentiating between array-like indexers and list indexers.
3. Identifying the key type correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inadequate handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function treats lists differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior. There is a discrepancy in identifying the key type correctly, leading to incorrect indexing behavior based on the key input.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that all types of key inputs (list, array-like, etc.) are treated consistently.
2. Identify the key type accurately to determine the proper indexing method (loc or iloc).
3. Modify the list handling in a way that aligns with the behavior of array-like indexers.
4. Implement a unified approach for handling key inputs to avoid confusion and inconsistencies.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Correctly identify the key type
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    # Handle list input similar to array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Adjust the logic based on the key type
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the function now consistently handles all types of key inputs, including lists. By identifying the key type accurately and adjusting the logic accordingly, the bug related to inconsistent behavior with list indexers should be resolved.
