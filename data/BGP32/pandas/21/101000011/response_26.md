### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, the bug is causing inconsistency when dealing with list indexers compared to array-like indexers. This issue arises due to how the function processes the key when it is a list.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Processing of list indexers.
2. Handling of different types of indexers.
3. Determining whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistencies in how they are treated compared to other types of indexers. This results in the KeyError when a list indexer is used, as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve adjusting the logic for processing list indexers and ensuring that the appropriate method (loc or iloc) is used for accessing the data based on the indexer type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- I have adjusted the handling of list-like objects to ensure they are processed correctly.
- Removed the check for non-list-like objects, as it was creating inconsistencies.
- Simplified the logic for determining whether to use loc or iloc based on the indexer type.

This corrected version should resolve the inconsistency issue with list indexers as reported in the GitHub bug.
