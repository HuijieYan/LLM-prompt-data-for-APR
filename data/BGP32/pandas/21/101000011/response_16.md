### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas/core/series.py` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series. The bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers, which results in inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The branching condition for a list-like key may not be handling it correctly.
2. The return statement for a list key may not be appropriate.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the discrepancy and suggests that all types of indexers should behave like the list case. The current implementation fails to match the behavior for list indexers, leading to unexpected KeyErrors.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and maintain consistency across different types of indexers:
1. Ensure that list-like indexers are handled in a similar manner as other indexers.
2. Update the return statements and branching conditions to provide the expected behavior for list indexers.
3. Test the changes thoroughly to verify that the corrected function behaves consistently for all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # For list-like indexers, fall back to reindex
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now treats list indexers like other types of indexers by returning the Series based on the list content. This fix ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and addresses the reported issue on GitHub.
