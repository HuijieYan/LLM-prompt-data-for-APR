### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of key inputs such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. There seem to be inconsistencies in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency, especially when using a list key for indexing a series.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list key in the `_get_with` function may not be consistent with other indexer types.
2. The condition check for `is_list_like(key)` may not be capturing all scenarios correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises due to the discrepancy in how list indexers are treated in comparison to other indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. By reviewing the conditions and logic for handling different types of keys, we can make adjustments to ensure that the behavior is uniform across all indexer types.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle list indexing consistently
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent with other types of indexers for a more predictable and uniform behavior. By addressing the inconsistency pointed out in the GitHub issue, we aim to resolve the bug reported.
