### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to how list-like indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The code block `if isinstance(key, list): return self.loc[key]` seems to be causing the issue by treating list indexers differently from other indexers.
2. The block `elif not is_list_like(key): return self.loc[key]` could potentially cause issues with scalars that are not recognized as list-like.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug results from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers (list-like, array-like, etc.) in the `_get_with` function. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and key errors.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of indexers regardless of their type. It is necessary to treat list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers to avoid key errors and maintain a uniform API behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list) or is_scalar(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
        if is_categorical_dtype(self.index.dtype) or is_object_dtype(self.index):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle list indexers and scalars in a uniform manner by converting them to platform integers and then using `loc` or `iloc` based on the dtype of the index. This change ensures consistent behavior for different indexers and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
