## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library has a conditional block that differentiates between different types of indexers (`key`). The issue reported in the GitHub post highlights inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers when used to index a `Series`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of `list` type indexers when performing indexing.
2. Handling of `Index` objects and other array-like structures.
3. Determining the `key_type` based on the indexer type.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers. Specifically, the code snippet related to the `list` type indexers is not aligned with the behavior of array-like indexers, leading to unexpected results when using `list` indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, we need to adjust the handling of the `key` parameter when it is of type `list`. This adjustment should bring the behavior in line with how array-like indexers are handled.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Now handle array-like indexers correctly
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that `list` indexers are handled in a similar way to array-like indexers. By converting `key` to an `Index` object using `ensure_index`, we enable consistent behavior for different types of indexers. This approach aligns with the aim of the GitHub issue to resolve the inconsistency in indexing behavior across various indexers.
