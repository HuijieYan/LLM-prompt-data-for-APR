## Analysis:
1. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers in the pandas Series class.
2. The issue specifies that using a list indexer in the form `ser[list(key)]` results in a KeyError, while other types of indexers behave differently.
3. The buggy function `_get_with` in the Series class of pandas is one of the places where this inconsistency is likely occurring.
4. The buggy function `_get_with` incorrectly handles list-like indexers, leading to the observed issue.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of list-like indexers. The function mistakenly treats the key as a list in the code block `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` without considering the specific behavior required for list-like indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency, we need to adjust how the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers. Specifically, we should ensure that list indexers are treated appropriately to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Correct handling for list-like indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we use `ensure_index` to handle list-like indexers appropriately before calling `reindex`. This adjustment ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers in the pandas Series class.
