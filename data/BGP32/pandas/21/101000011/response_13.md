### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas/core/series.py` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, tuples, DataFrames, and lists. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. It specifically mentions that passing a list indexer to a `Series` is triggering a `KeyError` due to differences in how it's handled.

### Potential Error Locations:
The bug could be related to how list indexers are processed and the logic for deciding whether to treat the list as positional or label-based.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, it is wrongly treated as a label-based indexer, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to locate the elements based on labels that don't exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that list indexers are processed correctly and not treated as label-based indexers when they are not. We need to update the condition checking for list indexers and apply the appropriate indexing method based on the indexer type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Correctly handle list indexers as positional
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]  # Ensure list indexers are treated as positional

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key change is in the block handling list indexers. Now, list indexers are correctly processed as positional rather than label-based, avoiding the `KeyError` mentioned in the GitHub issue. This adjustment aligns the handling of list indexers with other array-like indexers, improving consistency.
