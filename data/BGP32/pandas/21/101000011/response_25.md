## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, lists, etc. The bug seems to arise when dealing with list-like key indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of list-like key indexers may not be consistent.
2. The condition checks and type conversions for different types of key indexers might not be accurate.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent behavior between array-like indexers and list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list is passed as the key indexer, the function mistakenly expects behavior similar to array-like cases, resulting in a KeyError.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like key indexers are handled correctly in a manner consistent with array-like indexers. This means changing the condition checks and conversion steps for list-like key indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to a list for further checks if not already an array-like object
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is not array-like or an Index object. In such cases, we directly use `self.loc[key]`. Additionally, we convert the key to a list for further checks to ensure consistent behavior. This updated handling should resolve the bug and align the behavior with the expected outcomes for different types of key indexers.
