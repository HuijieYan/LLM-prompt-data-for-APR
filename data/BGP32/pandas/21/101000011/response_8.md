### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a `Series` object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various other objects.
2. The GitHub issue highlights a specific inconsistency related to how list indexers are handled compared to array-like indexers.
3. The key points to note are:
   - When using `ser[list(key)]`, it raises a KeyError due to a mismatch between the index and the provided key.
   - The behavior for different types of indexers, especially list indexers, needs to be aligned to have consistent handling.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of list indexers, where it fails to correctly process the key when it's a list type, causing a KeyError as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers and align it with the behavior of array-like indexers. We should modify the logic to correctly process the list of keys and match them with the Series index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = [index for index in key if index in self.index]
        
        if not key:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added `ensure_index(key)` to ensure the key is converted to an Index if it's not already.
2. Processed list keys to filter out elements that are not present in the Series index.
3. If the resulting key list is empty, raise a KeyError as specified in the GitHub issue.
4. Ensured that list indexers are handled consistently with array-like indexers.

By making these modifications, the corrected function should now handle list indexers properly and provide the expected behavior based on the input key, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
