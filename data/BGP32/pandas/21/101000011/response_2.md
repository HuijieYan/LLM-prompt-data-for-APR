### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` handles different types of indexing keys and routes them to different processing paths.
2. The provided GitHub issue highlights inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are treated, specifically focusing on the behavior of `ser[list(key)]`.
3. The bug arises due to different treatment of indexers based on their types, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers.
4. To fix the bug, all indexers should be treated consistently to avoid such unexpected behavior.
5. We can modify the implementation of `_get_with` to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Handle all types of indexers consistently to ensure that the behavior is predictable and matches user expectations.
2. Update the condition checks and routing logic within the `_get_with` function to address the inconsistencies reported in the GitHub issue.
  
### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Ensure consistent handling of all types of key indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if lib.is_bool_array(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected version provided above, the bug related to inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers should be resolved.
