### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a pandas Series. The issue reported on GitHub highlights inconsistent behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers when accessing a Series with no matches.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of `list` indexers might not be consistent with other types of indexers.
2. The logic to distinguish between integer and label-based indexers could be causing issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to stem from a discrepancy in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is used and no matches are found, the behavior is not consistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior for list indexers aligns with how other types of indexers are handled when no matches are found. Adjusting the logic to handle list indexers more consistently should resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
            # Handle the case of list indexers more consistently
            return self.reindex(key)
    
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case of list indexers more consistently by reindexing when no matches are found, aligning the behavior with how other types of indexers are handled. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
