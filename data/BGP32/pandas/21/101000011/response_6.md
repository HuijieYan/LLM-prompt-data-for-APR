### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The function has different conditional statements to handle indexers based on their types.
3. The issue on GitHub points out an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like or dataframe indexers.
4. The bug seems to be related to how list-based indexers are processed and can potentially lead to KeyError inconsistencies.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional block for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function.
2. The conversion of list-based keys to a list in the function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the inconsistent treatment of list-based indexers compared to other types like array-like or dataframe indexers. Due to this inconsistency, the function might throw a KeyError when processing list-based keys, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-based indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This may involve modifying the conditional statements that differentiate between indexers and updating the logic for processing list-based keys to avoid any KeyError issues.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the conditional block for handling list-based keys to align with how other types of indexers are processed.
2. Combined the handling of list and numpy array indexers to ensure consistency.
3. Removed unnecessary conversion of key to a list in some cases.

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-based indexers more consistently and avoid any potential KeyError issues as reported in the GitHub issue.
