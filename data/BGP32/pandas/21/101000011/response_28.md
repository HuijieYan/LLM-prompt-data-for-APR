## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` file aims to handle various types of key inputs to retrieve values from the Series object. The issue highlighted on GitHub points out the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The function flow for handling different types of keys.
2. The condition checks for different key types that determine whether to use `loc` or `iloc`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access non-matching indices. This issue results in unexpected behavior and differs from how array-like indexers are treated.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug and align with the GitHub issue, the function `_get_with` needs to be updated to handle list indexers in a similar manner to array-like indexers. To achieve this, adjustments are needed in the condition checks and the flow of operations to ensure a consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # Handle the case where list indexers are used
        if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "object":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the function `_get_with` should now correctly handle list indexers, providing a consistent behavior across all types of indexers as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
