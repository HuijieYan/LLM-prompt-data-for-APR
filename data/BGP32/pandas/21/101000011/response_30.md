### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with()` is part of the `Series` class in Pandas, responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, specifically mentioning the difference in behavior when using `ser[list(key)]` compared to other types of indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for handling list-like keys might be causing the bug.
2. The handling of key types like lists, arrays, and indexes could be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the difference in handling list-like keys compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with()` function. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when using list indexers and results in a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with()` function. Specifically, we need to address the check for list-like keys and ensure that the behavior is aligned with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list keys has been adjusted to ensure consistency with other types of indexers. Now, the behavior of indexing using `ser[list(key)]` should be aligned with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
