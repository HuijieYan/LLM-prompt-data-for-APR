The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library has an issue related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers. The issue is described in the GitHub problem related to Series indexing behavior when using list indexers.

The buggy function encounters an error when processing list indexers, as it does not handle them consistently compared to other array-like indexers. The function uses a series of condition checks to determine the type of key provided and act accordingly. When dealing with list indexers, it returns an error because it expects the key to be present in the index, which is not the case for list indexers.

To fix the bug, the function logic should be adjusted to handle list indexers in a way consistent with other array-like indexers. One way to achieve this is by updating the condition checks to properly handle list indexers and avoid raised errors when no matches are found in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "list"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix includes handling list indexers as a separate case alongside other array-like indexers. It ensures that when using list indexers, the function behaves consistently and does not raise errors when the key is not found in the index.
