### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values. However, there is an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and provides an example where using `ser[list(key)]` leads to a KeyError while other types of indexers do not lead to an error.

### Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
1. Handling of list-like indexers where it is inconsistent compared to other types of indexers.
2. The logic for treating different types of indexers needs to be revised to ensure consistency and prevent errors like the one mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is not treating list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list-like indexer. The logic for handling different types of indexers is not uniform, leading to errors in certain cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to treat list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. It should follow a unified logic for handling all types of indexers to avoid errors like the one reported in the GitHub issue.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the inconsistency and fixes the bug:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type of key")
```

In the corrected version, list indexers are now treated consistently with other types of indexers, and the function handles all types of indexers in a uniform manner. The bug causing inconsistency with list-like indexers has been resolved.
