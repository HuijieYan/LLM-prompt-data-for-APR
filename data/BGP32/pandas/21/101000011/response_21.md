### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for indexing a `Series` object with different types of input `key`. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers versus other array-like indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of indexers when `key` is a list.
2. Determining the `key_type` and deciding whether to treat the indexer as positional or label-based.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent treatment of different types of `key` indexers in the `_get_with` function. The issue report specifically mentions the discrepancy in behavior when using list indexers, causing confusion and inconsistency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To address the bug and make the behavior consistent with different types of `key` indexers, we need to ensure that list indexers behave similarly to other array-like indexers. This may involve adjusting the condition checks and the handling of `key_type`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]  # Reverting to original behavior for non-list indexers

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "boolean"]:
            # Treating both integer and boolean indexers as positional indexing
            return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.loc[key]  # Making all other indexers act with .loc behavior
```

In the corrected version, I've modified the logic to ensure that list indexers and other array-like indexers behave consistently in the `_get_with` function. This change should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and provide a more coherent indexing behavior.
