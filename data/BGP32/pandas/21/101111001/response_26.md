### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is primarily designed to handle different types of key inputs and locate values based on those keys within a Series object. In the failing test cases, the key is being passed with different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series), but the function fails to handle all these cases correctly. 

The bug seems to arise from how the function handles the key types and determines the `key_type`. The function incorrectly interprets the key type as `'string'`, which leads to the function following the wrong execution path and eventually causing a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should revisit the logic used to determine the `key_type` and the subsequent handling of different key types in the function. The function should identify the key type accurately and branch the execution based on that key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version improves the handling of different key types and accurately determines the `key_type` to decide between positional indexing (iloc) and label-based indexing (loc). By updating the conditional checks and branching based on the `key_type`, the function should now handle various key types correctly and pass the failing test cases.
