### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When calling `ser[key]` in the failing test, the function fails to handle the case where the `key` is a list-like object (an array, Index, or Series) containing elements (e.g., a string) that are not present in the Series index.

The function mistakenly identifies the `key_type` as `'integer'` or `'string'`, instead of recognizing the list-like object as a list of strings. This misclassification leads to the incorrect branch selection in the function, which ultimately results in a `KeyError` being raised instead of handling the situation gracefully.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies list-like objects (arrays, Index, Series) with non-existent elements as a list of strings. Based on this identification, we should handle the case where elements in the `key` are not present in the Series index by raising a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("None of the elements in key are in the index")

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = "string"

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError("None of the elements in key are in the index")
```

By making the necessary adjustments in the type identification and adding a check to handle the case where none of the elements in `key` are in the index, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the failing test cases.
