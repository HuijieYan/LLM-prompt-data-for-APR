The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrect handling of the `key` input, leading to the KeyError in the failing test. The issue lies in the code segment where it checks for key types and decides whether to treat the key as positional or label-based. The bug arises when the key is not recognized correctly as a list-like object due to incorrect conditions and handling.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions and handling of different key types by considering the input `key` correctly as a list-like object. We will update the function to correctly handle the key as a list-like object so that the KeyError does not occur.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    ...
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
            if isinstance(key, Index):
                key_type = key.inferred_type
            else:
                key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

            if isinstance(key, list):
                return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the different types of `key` inputs and avoid the KeyError in the failing test cases.
