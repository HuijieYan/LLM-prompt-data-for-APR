### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series properly. It wrongly infers the key_type as `'string'` in all cases, which leads to incorrect handling of the input.

### Bug Explanation:
The function fails to appropriately identify the type of `key` when it is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series, resulting in the wrong `key_type`. This leads to incorrect branching based on the `key_type`, causing the function to return unexpected results.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case where `key` is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series by correctly inferring the `key_type` based on the type of input. We can use the provided indication of input types such as list, numpy array, Index, or Series to determine the appropriate type of key and adjust the branching logic accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the logic to correctly infer the `key_type` based on the input type of `key`, the corrected function should now handle the cases where `key` is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series properly, resolving the bug and passing the failing tests.
