### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function has a condition that checks if the key is not list-like, and if so, it tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`. However, when the key is a series or other types, the behavior is undefined leading to a KeyError. This is evident from the failing test where the key is a series, and the buggy function fails to handle it correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
In the failing test, the key is a Series object, so when the buggy function encounters this type of key, it incorrectly tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError because the Series object as a key does not match any index values.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the key is a Series object before trying to use `self.loc[key]`, as it might result in a KeyError. Instead, we should return an appropriate error message or raise an exception when the key is of an unsupported type.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("Unsupported key type, must be list-like")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError("Unsupported key type encountered")
```

After applying the fix, the function will handle unsupported key types such as Series objects more gracefully and raise a KeyError with an appropriate error message.
