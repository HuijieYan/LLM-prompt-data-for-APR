### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the `_get_with` function where the condition to handle non-list-like keys is incorrect. When the function receives a non-list-like key, it should fall back to using `self.loc[key]`. However, the current implementation fails to handle this correctly, leading to a KeyError when accessing the series with such keys.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition that handles non-list-like keys to properly use `self.loc[key]`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition to `elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Series, Index))`, we ensure that when the key is not list-like or is an instance of Series or Index, it returns `self.loc[key]` as intended.

This correction should resolve the KeyError issues observed in the failing test cases.
