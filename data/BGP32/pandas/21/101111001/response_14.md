The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the incorrect handling of input types when trying to extract values from the Series object. The function fails to handle the case where the key is a scalar value wrapped inside a Series object correctly. It mistakenly assigns the `key_type` as `'integer'` when it should have detected it as a `'string'`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to correctly identify the type of the key and differentiate between different scenarios like scalar values, lists, arrays, etc.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles scalar key values wrapped in Series objects, identifies their type as `'string'`, and directs the flow to the appropriate indexing method such as `loc` or `iloc` based on the type of the key.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing tests provided earlier.
