### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs due to incorrectly identifying the `key_type` as `'integer'` when it should actually be `'string'`. This leads to the function incorrectly trying to choose between positional (`iloc`) and label-based (`loc`) indexing based on the inferred type of the key, causing the KeyError to be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the dtype of the key and handle string keys by using label-based (`loc`) indexing regardless of whether positional indexing should be used based on the index.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    # For scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    if isinstance(key, str):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the function to correctly handle keys that are strings, the bug should be fixed and the function should pass the failing tests provided.
