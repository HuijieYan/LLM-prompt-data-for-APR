The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when handling various types of keys for indexing a Series. The issue comes from incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as `'integer'` when dealing with string keys. This leads to the wrong path being chosen for further processing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is accurately determined by examining the key's nature (e.g., string, integer, boolean) before deciding on the appropriate indexing mechanism.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() or isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series)):
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    return self.loc[key]
```

This fixes the bug by correctly differentiating between different types of keys. Now, the function will properly handle the key as an index if it is an integer and should fallback to positional indexing.
