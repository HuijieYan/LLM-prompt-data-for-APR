## Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the Series object. However, there are potential issues in the code that might cause unexpected behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` checks if the key is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which might cause a `TypeError` to be raised when indexing with a DataFrame.
2. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` might not handle all cases of non-list-like keys correctly.
3. The conversion of keys to a list (`key = list(key)`) might not work as expected in all scenarios.

## Bug Explanation:
The main issue in the code is handling different types of indexers (`key`) correctly. The code currently checks for specific types and then performs different operations based on those types. However, this approach might not cover all possible cases and may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys are handled correctly and consistently. We should consider a more robust approach to determine the type of the key and then decide how to process it. It's important to ensure that the code covers all possible scenarios of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list for consistency

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
- Non-list-like keys are converted to a list for consistency.
- The handling of different types of keys is simplified and made more consistent.
- All cases of indexers are covered, ensuring that the function behaves predictably in all scenarios.
