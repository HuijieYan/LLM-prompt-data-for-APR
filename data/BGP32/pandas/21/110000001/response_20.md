The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has a potential error in the logic for handling different types of `key`. 

The current logic contains an `if` condition to check if `key` is a list-like object that is not recognized as a scalar, and then tries to index the series using `self.loc[key]`. 

The issue arises when `key` is an iterable object (such as a dictionary), the function incorrectly tries to access `self.loc[key]` which may result in a `KeyError` since dictionaries cannot be directly used as indexers. 

To fix this bug, we can add an additional check to handle non-supported types of `key` and raise an informative error message.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, dict):
        raise TypeError(
            "Unsupported key type. Please use a valid index or a list-like object for indexing"
        )
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, we have added a check to handle unsupported types of `key` and raise a `TypeError` with an informative message. This will prevent the function from trying to directly access unsupported types as indexers, avoiding potential errors.
