The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the condition where it checks if the `key` is an instance of `Index`. The bug is that the function tries to access the `inferred_type` attribute directly on the `key` object, assuming it's an instance of `Index`, but in some cases, `key` might not have that attribute, leading to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can first check if `key` is an instance of `Index`, and only then access the `inferred_type` attribute. If `key` is not an instance of `Index`, we can use the `is_integer` function from the imported module to check if it's an integer and handle it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = getattr(key, 'inferred_type', None)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer" or is_integer(key):
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check to see if `key` is an instance of `Index` and then safely accessed the `inferred_type` attribute. If `key` is not an instance of `Index`, we used the `is_integer` function to check if it's an integer. By handling this case correctly, we prevent the AttributeError that was previously occurring.
