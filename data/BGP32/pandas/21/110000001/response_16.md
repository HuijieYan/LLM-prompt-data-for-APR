The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys passed for indexing a Series object. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type.

The bug in the function is in the following block of code:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check. The function is assuming that if the key is not list-like, it should be directly used with `self.loc`. However, this assumption is incorrect because there are other valid cases where the key might not be list-like and still should not be directly used with `self.loc`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that only scalar keys should be used directly with `self.loc`, and other non-list-like keys should be further processed based on their types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is a scalar using the `is_scalar()` function before using it directly with `self.loc`. For other non-scalar cases, we infer the data type of the key and then decide whether to use `self.loc` or `self.iloc` based on the key type. Finally, if the key is a list or another type of index, we return the result of `self.loc[key]`.
