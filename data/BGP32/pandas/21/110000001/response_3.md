## Analysis:
- The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate retrieval operation on the Series object.
- The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type of key.
- The bug seems to be related to how the key is handled when it is not a slice, ABCDataFrame, or tuple.

## Bugs:
1. When `key` is not a slice, ABCDataFrame, or tuple, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`. This could lead to an error if `key` is not indexable.
2. The code block handling the case when `key` is not list-like may not function correctly if the key is a scalar value that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not appropriately handle cases where the key is a scalar value or an object that is not directly indexable.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Add a check to ensure that the key is indexable before attempting to access it using `self.loc[key]`.
2. Update the logic to appropriately handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not lib.is_scalar(key):
        raise IndexError("Key must be indexable")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to ensure that the key is indexable before attempting to use it with `self.loc[key]`. Additionally, I included a condition to handle scalar values that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar` to prevent potential indexing errors.
