The bug in the `_get_with` function is occurring due to the incorrect logic in handling the different types of keys passed to the function. The function is designed to handle different types of keys like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects.

The bug is in the following part of the function:
```python
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
```

The issue here is that the condition is checking if `key` is not an instance of the mentioned types and if true, it is converting `key` to a list. However, this will cause an error if `key` is not list-like and not an instance of the specific types mentioned. This logic is not handling all potential key types correctly.

To fix this bug, we can improve the logic to check each type of key individually and handle it accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `key` is a scalar using `is_scalar` function, then handle the cases for lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects without converting `key` to a list if not necessary. This approach ensures that each type of key is properly handled without causing errors.
