## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of key input for indexing a Series. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing using a list compared to other array-like indexers.

## Error Location:
The error location in the buggy function `_get_with` is identified in the code block handling a non-list-like key input. The bug occurs when trying to index a Series using a list, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other array-like indexers.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code block handling a non-list-like key input does not correctly handle the case when a list is provided as the key. This leads to an inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with a list compared to other array-like indexers.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the key input is a list separately and ensure consistent behavior for all array-like indexers. We can modify the code to check if the key is a list and then perform the indexing accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the bug related to indexing a Series with a list key has been addressed by handling the list case separately and consistently. This fix ensures that the behavior is aligned with the indexing using other array-like indexers for a Series.
