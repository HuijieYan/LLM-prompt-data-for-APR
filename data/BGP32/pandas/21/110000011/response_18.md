## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in pandas. This function is responsible for handling different types of indexers when indexing a series. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an inconsistency when using list indexers compared to array-like indexers. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexers that don't match any values in the index.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The handling of list-like key indexers.
2. The conversion of key to a list when it's not already a list or array-like.
3. The decision-making process on whether to use positional or label-based indexing based on the key type.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is causing inconsistency when using list indexers that don't match any values in the series index. The `KeyError` is raised when attempting to index with a list containing values that are not found in the index. This behavior is different from how array-like indexers are handled, leading to confusion and inconsistency in the API.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. The key point of fixing would be to handle list indexers similarly to how array-like indexers are handled. This can involve checking for matching values in the index before returning the result.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    missing_values = [val for val in key if val not in self.index]
    if missing_values:
        # Handling case where values in key are not in the index
        missing_keys = Index(missing_values)
        raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_keys} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks for missing values in the index when using list indexers and ensures consistent behavior across different indexer types. It aims to provide a unified approach to handling indexers in the `Series` class, addressing the reported inconsistency in the GitHub issue.
