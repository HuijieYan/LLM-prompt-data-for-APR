### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling various types of indexers when accessing data.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers when accessing data from a Series object.
- The issue points out that using a list indexer results in a KeyError when no matches are found, whereas other types of indexers do not exhibit the same behavior.

### Error Locations:
1. The part of the code that handles the list indexer is likely causing the issue.
2. The `return self.loc[key]` statement inside the block for handling non-list-like scalars may also contribute to the problem.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to stem from the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, specifically when using list indexers.
- When a list indexer is used and no matches are found, it is raising a KeyError, leading to unexpected behavior based on the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To address the bug, we need to make the behavior consistent across all types of indexers. Handling list indexers in the same way as other types should resolve the issue.
- Removing the specific case for list indexers and treating them similarly to other types of indexers might fix the bug.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
- Removed the specific handling for list indexers.
- Updated the conditions to check if the key is list-like and treat it similarly to other types of indexers.
- Replaced the return statement for non-list-like scalars with `self.loc[key]` for consistency.
- Simplified the logic to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers.
