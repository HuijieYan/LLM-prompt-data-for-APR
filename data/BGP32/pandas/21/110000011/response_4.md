## Analysis:
The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is responsible for handling various kinds of indexers for a Series object, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, numpy arrays, etc. The bug seems to be related to different behaviors for list and array-like indexers, as highlighted in the GitHub issue description.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-like key
2. Determining the type of the key
3. Decision logic for using `loc` or `iloc` based on key type
4. Reindexing based on the key

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to inconsistent behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The bug causes different outcomes when using a list as an indexer compared to other types like numpy arrays or Index objects.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior between list and array-like indexers. We should handle list indexers in a similar way to other indexers to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected errors.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list indexers in a consistent way
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    # Determine the type of the key
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle list indexing and reindexing
    return self.loc[key] if isinstance(key, list) else self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types. We determine the type of the key and handle list indexing and reindexing appropriately. This should fix the bug related to different behaviors between list and array-like indexers.
