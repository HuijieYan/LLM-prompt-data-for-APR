The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from treating list indexers differently than array-like indexers within the function. This inconsistency leads to an error when indexing with a list that contains no matches.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. We should modify the logic to handle list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of other indexers when no matches are found.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. This change ensures that the behavior when indexing with a list that contains no matches is aligned with the expected outcome.
