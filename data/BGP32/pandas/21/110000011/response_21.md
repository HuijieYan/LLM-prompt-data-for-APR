The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the different treatment of list indexers versus array-like indexers in the pandas library. The function is designed to handle different types of indexers and process them accordingly, but the issue stems from inconsistency when dealing with list indexers.

The specific problematic scenario highlighted in the GitHub issue is that when using a list indexer to access elements that do not match any values in the Series, an error is being raised instead of returning `NaN` values for those missing elements. This behavior deviates from the handling of array-like indexers and causes inconsistency in how different types of indexers are processed.

To fix this bug and address the issue raised on GitHub, we need to ensure that list indexers behave consistently with array-like indexers by returning `NaN` values for missing elements instead of raising errors. This can be achieved by modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        missing_elements = [idx for idx in key if idx not in self.index]
        if missing_elements:
            result_series = pd.Series(index=key)
            return self.reindex(result_series.index)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version of the function, we specifically handle the case of list indexers by checking for missing elements in the Series index. If any elements from the list are not present in the index, we create a new Series with those missing elements and return a reindexed Series with `NaN` values for those missing elements. Otherwise, we proceed to access the elements as before for list indexers that match existing elements in the index.
