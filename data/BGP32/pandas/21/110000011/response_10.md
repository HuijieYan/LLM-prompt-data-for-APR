### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers such as array-like or Index.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statement handling `if not is_list_like(key):` might be incorrectly handling list indexers.
2. The return statement on line 44 might not be handling the list indexer correctly.
3. The conditional statement on line 50 for key_type inference might not be sufficient to cover all cases.
4. The handling of list indexers in the last return statement might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles list indexers. The handling of list indexers might not be consistent with other types of indexers, leading to the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub comment.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. This may involve revisiting the conditional statements and return statements to ensure proper handling of list indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle list indexers consistently
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, preventing the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub comment.
