### Analysis:
The `Series` class in pandas has a `_get_with` function that handles various types of keys for indexing. The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers like array-like or DataFrame.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling non-list-like scalars might be causing issues.
2. The logic for handling different key types may not be consistent or correct.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how list indexers are processed compared to other types of indexers. The inconsistency in handling list indexers could lead to unexpected behavior when indexing the Series object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including lists, are handled consistently in the `_get_with` function. We should also ensure that the behavior aligns with user expectations and that any type of indexer used results in the expected outcome.

### Bug-fixed Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Adjusted condition to handle all types of indexers
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we adjusted the condition to handle all types of indexers correctly. This should address the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `Series` class.
