### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing elements in the Series. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. It seems that the behavior of the function `_get_with` needs to be adjusted to handle the list indexers correctly.

### Error Locations:
1. The section where the function checks for `if not is_list_like(key)` and then tries to access the location using `self.loc[key]` may be causing the issue when dealing with list indexers.

2. The condition `if isinstance(key, list)` and the subsequent `return self.loc[key]` may also be related to the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the function not properly handling list indexers when accessing elements in the Series. This has led to inconsistency in behavior when compared to other types of indexers. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests that list indexers should behave similarly to other array-like indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle list indexers in a way that is consistent with other array-like indexers. This may involve adjusting the conditions and logic for different types of indexers to ensure that the behavior is uniform across all cases.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue reported on GitHub:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are handled appropriately, similar to other array-like indexers. This should address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
