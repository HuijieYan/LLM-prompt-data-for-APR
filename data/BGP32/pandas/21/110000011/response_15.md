## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is a part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. This function is responsible for handling different types of indexers (like slices, arrays, lists) to retrieve values from a `Series` object. The issue reported on GitHub relates to the inconsistency when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. Handling of `list` indexers.
2. Decision between positional (`self.iloc`) and label-based indexing (`self.loc`) for integer type indexers.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the inconsistent behavior when using `list` indexers with a `Series` object. The error arises from a key error in the `_validate_read_indexer` function because it is not properly handling the list indexers. This inconsistency is mentioned in the GitHub issue where using list indexers results in different behavior compared to array-like indexers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists.
2. Properly handle the decision between positional and label-based indexing for integer type indexers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handling list indexers
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we have ensured that all types of indexers are treated consistently, and the improper handling of list indexers has been addressed. This should resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
