The potential error location in the buggy function is the condition:
```python
if isinstance(key, list):
    return self.loc[key]
```
This condition is not correctly handling the case where `key` is a list with no matches in the series index, leading to the bug described in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where a list index is used, and there are no matches in the series index. This leads to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where a list index is used and there are no matches in the series index. We can achieve this by checking if any values in the `key` list are present in the series index, and then performing the appropriate operation based on the result.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if any values in the `key` list are present in the series index by using `any(k in self.index for k in key)`. If none of the values are in the index, a `KeyError` is raised. This fix ensures consistent behavior for list indexers with no matches compared to other types of indexers.
