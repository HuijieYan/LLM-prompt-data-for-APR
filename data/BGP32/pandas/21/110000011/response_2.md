## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers passed to the Series class. The issue reported on GitHub highlights a specific inconsistency in how list indexers are treated, compared to other types of indexers.

## Identified potential error locations:
1. The handling of list indexers may be causing the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
2. The check for `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` may not cover all possible cases correctly.
3. The logic for deciding between positional or label-based indexing based on index types may need refinement.

## Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `Series` class. This inconsistency leads to errors or unexpected results when handling list indexers. The cause of this bug lies in the `_get_with` function's logic for handling different types of indexers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. Any discrepancies in behavior between list indexers and other indexers should be addressed by updating the logic in the `_get_with` function.

## Corrected version of _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Use positional indexing (self.iloc) or label-based (self.loc) based on index type
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)) or (is_object_dtype(key) and not is_iterator(key)):
        return self._gets(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle all types of indexers consistently within the `_get_with` function, we can resolve the reported inconsistency related to list indexers. This corrected version aims to address the issue highlighted in the GitHub report by ensuring uniform behavior across different indexer types.
