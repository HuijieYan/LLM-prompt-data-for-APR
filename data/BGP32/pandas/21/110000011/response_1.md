## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
- The function is responsible for handling different types of indexing keys for a `Series` object.
- The GitHub issue highlights an inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers.
- The bug seems to stem from the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The issue also mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error consistently for all cases.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug seems to arise from the way the function handles list indexers.
- When an indexer key of type list is provided, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers is causing confusion and unexpected errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function.
- The function should treat list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers to avoid errors.
- Proper error handling should be implemented to prevent `KeyError` when dealing with list indexers.
- Ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected functionality described in the `Series` class documentation.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
- The function now handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers.
- Proper error handling is implemented to prevent `KeyError` when dealing with list indexers.
- The function aims to align with the expected behavior described in the `Series` class documentation and address the issue raised on GitHub.
