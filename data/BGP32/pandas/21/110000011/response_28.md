### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of indexers for a Pandas Series object. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency when using list indexers and array-like indexers, specifically with the behavior of `ser[list(key)]`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-like indexers.
2. Determining the key type for indexing.
3. Deciding whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers (`list(key)`) as opposed to array-like indexers. The function may not be properly handling the case of list indexers, leading to unexpected behavior and possibly resulting in KeyError exceptions.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, numpy array, etc.). Specifically, the handling of list indexers needs to be addressed to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Check if the key is list-like
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        # Convert key to list if it's not already
        if not isinstance(key, list):
            key = list(key)
        
        # Determine the type of key
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            # Handle the case of list indexers
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we ensure that list indexers are properly handled by converting the key to a list if it's not already and then using `self.loc[key]` for indexing. This way, the behavior will be consistent for all types of indexers, including list indexers.
