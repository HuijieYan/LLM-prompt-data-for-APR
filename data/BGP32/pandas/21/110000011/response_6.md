### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is used to handle various types of indexing for a pandas Series object. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are treated differently, causing inconsistencies when trying to access elements that do not match the Series index.

### Potential error locations:
1. The handling of index types in the if-else statements.
2. Different behaviors for list, ndarray, and Index types.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent treatment of different indexers when trying to access elements in a Series object using non-matching indexes. The code does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError due to a mismatch between the index and the provided key.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when accessing elements in a Series object. Specifically, we need to make sure that list indexers are handled correctly and do not raise errors when elements are not found in the Series index.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes made:
1. Removed the check for non-list-like scalars, as it was causing confusion and potential errors.
2. Simplified the indexing checks to focus on list-like indexers and determine the key_type using `lib.infer_dtype`.
3. Merged the handling of list indexers to avoid dup indexing, providing consistent behavior for different index types.

By making these changes, the corrected function should handle different types of indexers more consistently and prevent errors when accessing elements in a pandas Series object.
