## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of indexers to retrieve values from a Series object. The issue reported on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in the behavior when using list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers like ndarray, Index, or Series. The bug causes a KeyError with a message indicating that none of the elements in the list indexer are present in the Series index.

## Error location:
The bug is likely to be located in the condition handling list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function.

## Cause of the bug:
When the function encounters a list-like key (list or ndarray), it attempts to use `self.loc[key]`. However, if the key contains values that do not exist in the Series index, a KeyError is raised because the `loc` method expects the given index positions to exist in the Series index.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list-like indexers so that it aligns with the behavior when using other types of indexers. We can modify the logic to handle the case where some values in the list indexer do not exist in the Series index gracefully without raising a KeyError.

## Corrected version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_set = set(key)
        found_in_index = key_set.intersection(self.index)
        values = self.loc[list(found_in_index)].tolist()
        return pd.Series(values, index=found_in_index)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when encountering a list-like indexer, we first find the subset of values that exist in the Series index using set operations. Then, we extract the corresponding values from the Series and create a new Series object with the found values indexed by the intersection of the original key and the index.

This approach ensures that even if some values in the list indexer do not match the Series index, the function can still return a subset of values that exist in the index, resolving the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
