### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function is responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object, where the bug seems to be related to how list indexers are treated.
3. The bug seems to cause inconsistency when indexing using a list compared to other indexers like array-like or Index.
4. The cause of the bug might be related to how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to ensure uniform treatment of indexers irrespective of their type, specifically addressing the issue related to list indexers causing a KeyError.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function to address the bug based on the issue related to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is not list-like or an instance of a Series to avoid the KeyError issue. We then default to using `self.loc[key]` to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers.

This fix aims to resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue by handling list indexers in a similar manner to other indexers, ensuring a more robust and predictable behavior for indexing operations on Series objects.
