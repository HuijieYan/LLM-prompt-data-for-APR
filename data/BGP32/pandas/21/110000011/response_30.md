The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers when indexing a Series object. This behavior is causing inconsistent results when accessing values through different types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. We can modify the condition checking for list-like keys and treat them in a uniform way with other supported indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the necessary changes in handling list-like keys within the function, we align the behavior of list indexers with other supported indexers, ultimately resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
