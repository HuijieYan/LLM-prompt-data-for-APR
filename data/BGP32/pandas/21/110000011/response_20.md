### Analysis:
The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling various types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, and more. The issue reported on GitHub indicates inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, specifically highlighting the different behavior when using a list as an indexer compared to other array-like indexers.

### Identified Error:
The identified error lies in how the function handles the case when the `key` parameter is a list. The implementation lacks consistent handling for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, leading to the reported inconsistency.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers. The lack of uniform behavior for different types of indexers leads to unexpected outcomes and inconsistencies in the results.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. This can be achieved by updating the code to treat list indexers similarly to how other array-like indexers are handled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for `not isinstance(key, list)` before handling the case where the `key` is a list. This change ensures that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the reported inconsistency.
