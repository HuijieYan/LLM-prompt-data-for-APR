### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. It is responsible for handling various types of indexers like slices, data frames, tuples, lists, etc., and returning the corresponding values from the series.

The GitHub issue highlighted a specific inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other indexers like array-like or index objects. When using a list as an indexer, an error is raised due to a key error stating that none of the elements in the list are in the series index.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The code block handling the case when `key` is not list-like might not handle all cases correctly.
2. The logic for handling different types of indexers (like list, numpy array, pandas Series) may be causing the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the bug
The issue arises due to the mismatch in handling list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers. The function is not correctly handling list indexers, leading to a key error if the elements of the list are not present in the series index. This inconsistency has been identified in the GitHub issue where list indexers behave differently compared to other indexers.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of indexers in the function `_get_with`. Specifically, we need to address the issue related to list-like indexers and align the behavior with the expected outcome mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected version of the function `_get_with`
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):  # Fixed handling for non-list-like values
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the function now properly handles non-list-like indexers and ensures a consistent behavior for all types of indexers, aligning with the expected outcomes mentioned in the GitHub issue.
