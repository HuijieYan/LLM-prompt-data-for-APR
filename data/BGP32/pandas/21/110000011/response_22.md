### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, etc.) and returning the appropriate values based on the type of indexer used.
- The bug seems to be related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers, which causes unexpected behavior when using a list indexer.
- The GitHub issue points out the discrepancy in behavior when using list indexers, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

### Error Location:
- The error seems to be occurring in the block of code where different types of indexers are being checked and processed.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug seems to stem from the conditional checks and handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function.
- When a list indexer is used, the code is not handling it correctly, leading to the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to address the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers.
- We should ensure that list indexers are processed correctly and do not result in unexpected errors.
- We can modify the conditional checks and handling of list indexers to align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
- Updated the conditional checks to handle different types of indexers appropriately.
- Modified the handling of list indexers to align with the expected behavior.
- Ensured that the correct indexer type is determined and used to return the values accordingly.
