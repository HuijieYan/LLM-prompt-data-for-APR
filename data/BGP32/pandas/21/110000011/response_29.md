## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of indexers when indexing a Series object. The function checks the type of the key provided and then proceeds to return a slice of the Series based on the key.

## Identified Issues:
1. The function does not handle the case when the key is a list.
2. The function incorrectly treats a list-like key as a scalar, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.
3. The function does not handle the case when the key is an Index object properly.

## Cause of the Bug:
The GitHub issue indicates that there is inconsistency in how list indexers and other array-like indexers are treated in Pandas. The `ser[list(key)]` case raises an error due to how the function is handling list-like keys. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when indexing a Series with a list key.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to properly handle list-like keys.
2. Ensure that appropriate checks are in place to distinguish between different types of indexers.
3. Handle the case when the key is an Index object correctly.
4. Align the behavior of list indexers with other array-like indexers to maintain consistency.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check to handle list-like keys by treating them the same way as other array-like indexers. This change ensures consistency in how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function.
