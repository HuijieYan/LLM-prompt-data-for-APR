### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for indexing a Series object based on different types of keys like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, especially when dealing with a list key. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using a list key for indexing compared to other types of indexers.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition for `is_list_like(key)` might not correctly handle the list key scenario.
2. In the case of a list key, the function might not reindex properly.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by a mismatch in the behavior of indexing when using a list key compared to other types of indexers. When a list key is used, the bug causes incorrect behavior leading to a KeyError, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexer types.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers when indexing a Series object. Specifically, when dealing with a list key, it should not result in a KeyError and should reindex properly.

### Corrected version of the function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check for `is_list_like(key)` before converting the key to a list type and made sure to handle the reindexing correctly for a list key. This should address the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue and provide a more robust indexing behavior for different types of indexers in the `Series` class.
