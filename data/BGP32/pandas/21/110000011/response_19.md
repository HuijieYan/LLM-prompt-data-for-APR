### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` handles different cases of indexing, including slices, dataframes, tuples, scalar values, lists, arrays, and index type. It attempts to decide whether to treat the indexer as positional or label-based.
- The issue on GitHub highlights an inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to array-like indexers, specifically when there are no matches in the Series.
- The current implementation may not handle the cases mentioned in the GitHub issue correctly, leading to KeyError when using a list indexer with no matches.

### Identified issue:
The bug stems from the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function, especially when there are no matches in the Series. The code snippet `return self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys may lead to a KeyError when using a list indexer with no matches.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To address the bug and align the behavior with the expectations from the GitHub issue:
- Analyze the key type to handle the case of list-like indexers with no matches more effectively.
- Ensure that using a list indexer with no matches results in consistent behavior without raising a KeyError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to list for consistent handling

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if len(self.loc[key]) == 0:  # Check if no matches found
            return self.reindex(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes a check to handle list-like indexers with no matches more effectively, ensuring consistency in behavior across different indexer types. This fix aligns with the details mentioned in the related GitHub issue.
