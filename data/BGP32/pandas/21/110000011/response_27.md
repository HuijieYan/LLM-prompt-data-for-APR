### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Index objects.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. Handling of different index types like lists, arrays, and Index objects.
2. Decision making between positional and label-based indexing based on key types.
3. Lack of consistent behavior in handling different index types.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of list indexers in comparison to array-like indexers when indexing a Series object. This inconsistency is causing unexpected behavior when indexing with a list, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. The bug needs to be addressed by revisiting the logic used to differentiate between different types of indexers and ensuring that the handling of list indexers is consistent with other index types.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the handling of list indexers has been modified to ensure consistent behavior with other types of indexers. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and provide a more reliable and predictable indexing mechanism for Series objects in pandas.
