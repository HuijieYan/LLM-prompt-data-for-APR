### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is used within the `Series` class to handle different types of keys passed for indexing a `Series` object. The function checks the type of the key and performs specific actions based on whether it is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object.

### Issues
1. In the current implementation, the function checks if the key is an instance of `Index` without checking for `ABCDataFrame` first. This leads to incorrect handling of DataFrame keys, resulting in a `TypeError` instead of allowing the appropriate DataFrame column to be used for indexing.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused because the condition for checking DataFrame keys comes after the condition for checking `Index` keys. Due to this ordering, when a DataFrame key is passed, it is identified as an `Index` instance, triggering a `TypeError` instead of processing it correctly as a DataFrame key.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to reorder the condition checks in the function `_get_with` such that DataFrame keys are checked for first before checking for `Index` keys. This way, DataFrame keys will be handled correctly without raising a `TypeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):  # Changed to ABCDataFrame
        # Process DataFrame keys correctly
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = list(key)
        return self._gets(key)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Remaining code stays the same
``` 

In the corrected version, the check for `ABCDataFrame` has been moved up to handle DataFrame keys before any other checks. This modification will ensure that DataFrame keys are correctly processed without raising a `TypeError`.
