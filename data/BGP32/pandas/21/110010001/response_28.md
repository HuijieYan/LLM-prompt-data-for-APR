### Analysis:
The `TypeError` observed in the error messages indicates that the `_get_with` function is unable to handle certain types of keys correctly. This leads to the `KeyError` being raised in the test cases, as the function fails to process the key provided.

### Bugs in the `_get_with` function:
1. The function does not handle `Index` and `Series` types correctly, leading to the `TypeError` when such keys are encountered.
2. The logic for processing non-list-like keys is not implemented correctly.
3. There seems to be a confusion between different key types that the function is trying to process.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incomplete handling of different key types within the `_get_with` function. This incomplete handling leads to key types like `Index`, `Series`, and certain non-list-like scalars not being processed correctly, causing the function to raise `TypeError` and `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add specific checks to handle key types like `Index` and `Series` properly.
2. Correct the logic for processing non-list-like keys.
3. Ensure uniform treatment and processing of all key types to avoid confusion and errors.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Handling Index or Series types
        if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            return self.loc[key] if is_list_like(key) else self.loc[key.tolist()]
        
        # Handling non-list-like keys
        if not is_list_like(key) or is_object_dtype(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With these changes, the `_get_with` function should now be able to handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing test cases.
