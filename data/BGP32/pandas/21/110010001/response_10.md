### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a series.
2. The function has a conditional block for checking the type of the key, but there seems to be a missing case for handling `ABCSeries` class as a key.
3. The error message indicates that when trying to index a Series with another Series, the expected `KeyError` exception is not being raised. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the case when the key is a Series.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a case to handle when the key is an instance of `ABCSeries`.
5. We should modify the function to check if the key is an instance of `ABCSeries` and raise a `KeyError` in this case, as indexing with a Series is not supported. 

### Fixed Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        raise KeyError(
            "Indexing a Series with another Series is not supported."
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the fixed version, I added a new `elif` block to check if the key is an instance of `ABCSeries`, and if so, raise a `KeyError` indicating that this operation is not supported. This change ensures that an appropriate exception is raised when trying to index a Series with another Series.
