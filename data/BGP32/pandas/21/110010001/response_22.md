### Analysis:
The error message is indicating that the buggy function `_get_with` is not handling certain conditions properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to index a `Series` with a key that is not present in the index.

### Identified issues:
1. The `is_list_like(key)` check is causing an issue when the key is not list-like.
2. The code is unable to correctly handle indexing with a `pandas.Series` object.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the function not properly handling certain types of inputs, specifically a key that is not list-like, resulting in an incorrect index operation and leading to a `KeyError` in the test cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the key provided and handle different types appropriately.
2. Ensure that the key type is handled correctly for indexing operations.

### Corrected version of `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self[self.index.get_indexer(key)]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- We handle scalar keys separately by directly indexing with `.loc[key]`.
- We use `get_indexer()` to retrieve the indexes of the provided key and return the corresponding elements.
- The function should now handle different types of keys appropriately and avoid the `KeyError` issue in the failing test cases.
