### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class, corresponding error message
The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class from the pandas library. This function handles different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The failing tests are related to using different types of keys (list, numpy array, Index, Series) to index a Series object and expecting a `KeyError` to be raised if the key does not exist in the index, but the error is not being raised as expected.

### Potential error locations within the buggy function
1. The if-elif-elif block checks the type of `key`, but there might be an issue in determining the correct type of the key.
2. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` might not be handling all types correctly.
3. The logic for deciding whether to use `iloc` or `loc` based on the key type could be causing the issue.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug seems to be related to how the `key` is being handled in the `_get_with` function. When using different types of keys like a list, numpy array, Index, or Series to index a Series object, the correct behavior should be to raise a KeyError if the key does not exist in the index. However, the function is not raising the KeyError as expected, leading to failing tests.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that the correct type of the key is identified and handled consistently.
2. Update the logic for handling different types of keys to ensure that a KeyError is raised if the key does not exist in the index.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate column(s)"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # handle scalars
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    try:
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the error message for handling DataFrame or Series keys.
2. Used `ensure_index` to ensure that the key is converted to an Index type.
3. Handled KeyError explicitly when the key does not exist in the index.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle different types of keys correctly and raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.
