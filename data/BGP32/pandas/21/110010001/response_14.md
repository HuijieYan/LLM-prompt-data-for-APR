### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a `Series` object. However, the bug occurs when the key is a `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`, which is not being handled correctly, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test.

### Error Cause:
1. The function is designed to handle different types of keys, but it doesn't account for cases where the key is a `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.
2. Incorrect handling of these key types results in a failed test due to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to properly handle the case when the key is a `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. The goal is to return an index-based lookup based on the key provided.
2. Ensure that the function can handle these key types without raising a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)
    
    if not all(isinstance(elem, (int, np.integer)) for elem in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Added a check to handle cases where the key is an `Index` or a `pd.Series` by calling `.reindex()` directly.
2. If the key is not a list-like object, the function attempts to locate the key using `.loc[]`.
3. For key types like `list`, it first checks if all elements of the list are integers, and if so, returns the values located at those specific positions using `.iloc[]`.
4. If the key is not entirely made up of integers, it raises a `KeyError` indicating that none of the elements are present in the index.
