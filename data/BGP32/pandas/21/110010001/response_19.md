### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas core has an issue when dealing with certain types of keys such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. The function is not handling these types of keys correctly, leading to a KeyError during the test. The error occurs when the function tries to access elements that are not present in the index of the Series object.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function checks if `key` is a slice or a DataFrame. If `key` is a slice, it slices based on the index, if a DataFrame it raises a TypeError and if it is a tuple, it expects to get values from the tuple. So far, this part of the code is working fine.
2. The buggy part starts when it checks if `key` is list-like. If `key` is not list-like, it tries to access the element using `.loc`. However, this can lead to a KeyError if the element is not present in the index.
3. The bug occurs because even if `key` is a list, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`, it incorrectly goes to the `if not is_list_like(key):` block and tries to access the element directly using `.loc`, causing KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function handles `key` when it is list-like. Instead of directly accessing the element using `.loc`, we should check if the key is an index. If it is an index, we should use the `.loc` method, and if not, we should use `.reindex`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is first verified to be list-like. If it is list-like, it is converted into an index using `ensure_index` method to ensure correct handling of the key. This ensures that the function will correctly handle keys that are list-like and will prevent the KeyError that was previously occurring.
