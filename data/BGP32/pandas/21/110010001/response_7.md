### Analysis:
In the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, there are several conditions to handle different types of keys for indexing. The bug seems to be related to the handling of certain key types, leading to a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like key.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs when indexing with a list, numpy array, Index, or Series. The code should correctly handle these index types and retrieve the values accordingly. However, due to a logical flaw, the key is being treated as an individual position or label when it should be treated as a list of keys.

The error message indicates that the index "C" is not found in the actual index, which results in a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify how the list-like keys are handled, specifically when they are instances of `list`, `numpy.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`. Instead of treating these keys as individual positions or labels, the code should retrieve values for all keys in the list.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the clause handling list-like keys, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle indexing with `list`, `numpy.ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series` instances. This correction ensures that all keys in the list are processed accordingly.
