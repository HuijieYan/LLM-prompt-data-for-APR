### Analysis:
The `buggy function` in the `Series` class, `_get_with(self, key)`, contains a bug that raises a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with certain data types like a list, numpy array, Index instance, or pandas Series. The error message indicates that the function should raise a `KeyError` with a specific message when the given key is not found in the index, but it fails to do so in the current implementation.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block where it tries to access `self.loc[key]`. This block is mistakenly trying to access the location of a scalar key directly, leading to the `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug is caused by assuming that a non-list-like key can be directly used as an index without proper handling. This assumption leads to incorrect indexing operations and eventually results in a `KeyError`. The code fails to appropriately handle non-list-like keys, such as scalars.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle non-list-like keys appropriately by checking their type and performing the necessary operations. If the key is not list-like, we should raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message indicating that the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
 
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the error handling for non-list-like keys and raising a `KeyError` with the appropriate message, the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function should now pass the failing test cases.
