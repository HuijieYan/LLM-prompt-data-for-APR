1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class of the pandas library is causing errors when indexing with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function is trying to handle different types of keys, but it fails to accurately determine the type of key being used for indexing.

2. Based on the error messages, the issue arises when indexing with different types of keys, such as list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function is not able to properly handle these cases.

3. The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` is not properly identifying the type of key provided for indexing, leading to incorrect handling of the key types and resulting in a `KeyError` during indexing.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of key being passed for indexing and then handles it accordingly. In this case, we need to adjust the code to properly handle indexing with lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list, ndarray, Index, and Series for key
    if is_list_like(key) and not is_object_dtype(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key is converted to an Index if it is list-like and not of type `'object'`. Additionally, for single keys that are not list-like, they are converted to a list to handle the indexing properly. This adjusted logic should address the bug and allow the function to index correctly with lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series, resolving the `KeyError` issue.
