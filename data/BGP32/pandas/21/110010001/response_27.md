## Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` module is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a `Series` object.
- The function contains multiple checks based on the type of the key, like `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and fall back to `loc`, `iloc`, and `reindex` methods accordingly.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the indexing operation using the provided key did not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

## Bug Explanation
1. The function `_get_with` has a check for `is_list_like(key)` which defaults to `self.loc[key]`. This might lead to incorrect behavior if the key is not found in the index.
2. In the case where `key` is of type `Index`, the condition `if isinstance(key, Index)` is used to get the inferred type for `key`. However, in cases where `key` is provided as a `list` it might not use this condition. This can lead to incorrect type inference.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function treats different key types correctly and handles index lookup errors as expected.
2. Make sure that the type inference is applied consistently for different key types to determine the appropriate indexing method.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key = list(key)
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring consistent treatment of different key types and applying the correct type inference, the corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
