### Analysis:
The provided function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of inputs (`key`) to perform indexing operations. The error messages indicate that there is an issue when the input `key` is a list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the conditional check for `elif not is_list_like(key)`, which tries to access the `key` directly using `self.loc[key]`. When `key` is a list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`, this access results in a `KeyError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `key` is a list, numpy array, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series` separately. We should extract the values from these types of objects and then perform operations accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list, numpy array, pd.Index, and pd.Series
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            key = key.to_list()  # Convert Series to list
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other cases
    key = ensure_index(key)
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function explicitly checks for the types that are causing the error, converts those types to lists where necessary, and then performs the appropriate indexing operation based on the type of `key`. This fix should resolve the `KeyError` issues observed during testing.
