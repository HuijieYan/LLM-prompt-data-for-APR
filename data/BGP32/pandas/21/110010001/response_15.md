### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The error occurs when trying to index a `Series` object using a key that is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.
3. The buggy function checks the type of the key and then attempts to perform indexing based on the type. The bug likely arises because the logic for handling different types of keys is not correctly implemented.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for handling different types of keys is correct and that the correct indexing operation is performed for each type of key.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, pd.Index)):  # Updated to handle ndarray, list, and Index
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.Series):  # Handle key as a pd.Series
        return self._get_values(key)
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle all other cases including ExtensionArray and Index
    return self.loc[key if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)) else key]
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should now appropriately handle indexing with various key types, including `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. This should address the bug and ensure that the correct indexing operation is performed based on the type of key passed.
