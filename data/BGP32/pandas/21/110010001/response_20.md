### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input keys and perform the corresponding operations. However, it contains a bug related to handling the key giving rise to the `KeyError` in the failing test.

### Error:
The error occurs when trying to index a `Series` using a key of type `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. The error message indicates that the key being used is not found in the index of the `Series`, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug:
In the buggy function `_get_with`, when the key is of type `list`, it is being handled incorrectly. The code path that is supposed to handle list-like keys by calling `self.loc[key]` is not operating as expected, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the list-like keys are properly handled and that the correct indexing operation is performed based on the type of key provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Corrected handling of list-like keys
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Ensure the key is converted to a list for further processing
    if not isinstance(key, (list, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Now, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle list-like keys correctly, ensuring that the indexing operations are performed as intended.
