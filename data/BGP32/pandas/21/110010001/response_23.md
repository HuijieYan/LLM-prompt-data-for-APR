### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a series. The function checks the key type and performs specific actions based on the key type. The error message from the failing test indicates that the KeyError is not raised as expected when using certain key types like list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional statements checking the key type.
2. The use of `loc` and `iloc` indexing methods within the function.
3. The reindexing at the end of the function may cause issues.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug may be caused by the improper handling of non-unique index values or incorrect implementation of handling key types such as lists, ndarrays, Index, or Series. The conditional statements in the `_get_with` function may not cover all possible key types correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the conditions for different key types to ensure all types are handled correctly.
2. Use appropriate indexing methods like `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type.
3. Ensure that the reindexing process at the end of the function is properly implemented.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Added additional check for scalar keys using `is_scalar` function.
2. Converted the key to an index using `ensure_index` to ensure correct indexing.
3. Minor modifications to optimize the key handling logic based on the user guide provided in the `Series` class documentation.

By applying these corrections, the `_get_with` function should now handle different key types correctly and pass the failing test scenarios.
