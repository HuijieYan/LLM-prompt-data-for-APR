### Analyzing the buggy function and failing tests

The buggy function, `_get_with`, aims to handle different types of indexers for a Pandas Series. The failing tests indicate issues related to the behavior when `key` is passed as a list-like object.

1. The first failing test expects a `KeyError` when accessing `ser[key]` where `key` is a Series converted to a list.
2. The second failing test expects the same behavior as the previous case but with the key as an array.
3. The third failing test expects the same behavior but with the key as an Index object.
4. The fourth failing test expects consistency in handling different indexer types.

The analysis reveals that the function fails to handle list-like indexers appropriately, resulting in a `KeyError`.

### Bug in the Code

The bug in the code is related to how list-like indexers are processed. When `key` is a list, the logic does not handle it correctly, leading to the `KeyError` in the failing tests. 

In the failing cases, the correct behavior should be to treat list-like indexers consistently to avoid the `KeyError`. The function should consider list-like indexers the same way it handles other indexers like arrays or Index objects.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for list-like indexers in a way that ensures consistency in handling different indexer types. We should adjust the code to correctly process list-like indexers and prevent the `KeyError` in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the modification to properly handle list-like indexers and ensure consistency when accessing the Series with different indexer types.

By making these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing tests and behave as expected for list-like indexers, arrays, and Index objects.
