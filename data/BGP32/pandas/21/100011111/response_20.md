### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a Series.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that the behavior is inconsistent when indexing a Series with different types of containers like list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
- The function currently fails to properly handle the case where a list-like key is provided, leading to a KeyError in certain scenarios.
- The key_type is incorrectly identified as 'string' instead of 'integer' or 'boolean', causing incorrect behavior during indexing.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug arises due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of input key containers in the `_get_with` function.
- When a list key is passed, the function fails to handle it correctly and raises a KeyError.
- The misidentification of the key_type leads to improper branching within the function, causing unexpected behavior during indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
- Update the function to uniformly handle the indexing of a Series with list, ndarray, Index, and Series key containers.
- Ensure correct identification of key_type to determine the appropriate indexing method (i.e., loc or iloc).
- Modify the branching logic to address the issue of KeyError that arises when using a list-like key.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function above should address the issue of inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of containers and ensure proper handling of list-like keys.
