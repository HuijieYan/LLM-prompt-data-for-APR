### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the Series class in pandas. The issue arises when indexing a Series with a list-like object such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function treats the different types of indexers inconsistently, leading to incorrect behavior and KeyError exceptions.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located in the section where the function handles different types of indexers, specifically in the condition where the key is not recognized as list-like.

### Cause of Bug:
1. When a list-like key is passed to the function, it fails to handle the various types of indexers uniformly.
2. The behavior differs based on the type of indexer, leading to inconsistencies and KeyError exceptions.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function treats all types of indexers consistently when passed as list-like keys. By handling all indexers uniformly, we can prevent inconsistencies and ensure proper indexing behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like keys uniformly
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle the case where key is a list-like Index
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the implementation to handle list-like keys consistently and converting them to lists when necessary, we can address the bug and ensure proper indexing behavior.
