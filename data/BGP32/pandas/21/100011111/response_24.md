### Bug Fix Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is not properly handling the case when a list-like key is passed as an input, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.
2. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the list indexer correctly, causing a `KeyError`.
3. In all runtime cases, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'`, which causes the function to incorrectly execute the `else` branch and attempt an unsuccessful reindex operation due to key mismatch.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys and their indexing operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the function to handle list-like keys by identifying them explicitly and performing the appropriate indexing operation.
2. Modify the logic to ensure correct handling of list-like keys, avoiding the KeyError when indexing such keys.
3. Ensure that the function's behavior aligns with the expected operation for list-like keys according to the provided GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle list-like keys and ensuring that the indexing operation behaves consistently, we can address the bug identified in the failing test cases.
