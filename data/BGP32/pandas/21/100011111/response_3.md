### Analysis:
1. The bug occurs when indexing a Series with a list-like key that does not match any values in the Series index. The function incorrectly handles the list key case differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies mentioned in the GitHub issue.
2. The bug can be traced to the conditional statements in the function `_get_with` where handling of a list-like key is done differently from other types of indexers.
3. The bug causes a KeyError to not be raised for the case where a list-like key has no matches, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other types of indexers when no matches are found.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
The corrected version now handles list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers when no matches are found, ensuring that a KeyError is raised in such cases. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
