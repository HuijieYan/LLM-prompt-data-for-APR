### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases involve passing different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to the Series indexer `ser[key]`.
3. The bug seems to be related to how list-like objects are handled differently from other types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and a KeyError in certain cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from treating list indexers differently from other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list-like key for indexing a Series.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are handled consistently in the `_get_with` function. By aligning the behavior for different indexers, we can resolve the KeyError issue and achieve consistent indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that all types of indexers are handled consistently in the function, the corrected version should resolve the KeyErrors seen in the failing test cases and align the behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys.
