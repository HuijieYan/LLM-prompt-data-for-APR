### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, the bug arises when a list-like indexer is passed, leading to incorrect behavior and a `KeyError`. The issue seems to stem from inconsistent treatment of different indexers.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly handles the case when a list-like key is passed, leading to an erroneous `KeyError`.
2. The function does not appropriately differentiate between different types of indexers, causing discrepancies in behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to treat all indexers consistently.
2. Ensure that list-like key indexing behaves consistently with other types of indexers.
3. Refactor the logic to correctly handle the various types of key inputs to avoid the `KeyError` issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Index is not supported, use the appropriate column/Index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, slice):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version attempts to address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. By modifying the logic to treat all indexers consistently, the function should now behave as expected and pass the failing tests.
