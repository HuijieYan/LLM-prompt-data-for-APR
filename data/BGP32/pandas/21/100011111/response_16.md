### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The failing test is raising a `KeyError` indicating that the indexing is not functioning as expected for certain input types. The input types causing the error are lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects. The expected behavior is to return `NaN` for the key that is not present in the index.

### Issue:
The issue stems from the handling of different types of key indexers, especially when using lists as keys. The bug is related to inconsistent behavior while handling different types of key inputs.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the specific handling of list-type keys in the `_get_with` function. The function does not properly support indexing using lists.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle list-type keys, along with other types, and return the expected behavior of `NaN` for missing keys in the index.

### Updated Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)

    # Handle different types of key indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        # Handle list indexers
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now properly handle the different types of key indexers, including lists, and return the expected behavior for indexing a Series.
