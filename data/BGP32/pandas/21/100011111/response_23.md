### Summary:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file has a bug where it mishandles list-like indexers resulting in KeyError for list indexers. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers.

### Analysis:
1. The function checks the type of the `key`.
2. If the `key` is a slice, it converts it with `_convert_slice_indexer` method and slices the Series.
3. If the `key` is an `ABCDataFrame`, it raises a TypeError.
4. If the `key` is a tuple, it gets the values using `_get_values_tuple`.
5. If the `key` is not list-like, it tries to locate the key in Series using `loc`.
6. If the `key` is a single value, like a scalar, it tries to locate the key using `loc`.
7. Considering the key types 'integer', 'list', 'Index', and others, it tries to decide whether to use `loc` or `iloc`.
8. It encounters an issue with list key when attempting to reindex based on the key.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the function, causing it to fail and raise a KeyError. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like keys to ensure consistency and avoid KeyError. We can handle list-like keys similarly to how other indexers are treated.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # Fix to handle list-like keys

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a fix to correctly handle list-like keys by using `loc` to locate the keys. This adjustment ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

This fix should address the bug and make the function behave as expected based on the provided failing test cases.
