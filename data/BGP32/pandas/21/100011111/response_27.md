### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The issue arises when a list-like key is passed, resulting in an inconsistency with the behavior of other types of keys like ndarray or Index. The failing tests demonstrate this inconsistency and show that the function does not handle list-like keys properly.

### Bug Explanation:
When the function encounters a list-like key, it fails to handle it correctly, leading to a KeyError during indexing. This inconsistency in handling list-like keys compared to ndarray or Index keys causes the failing tests to raise errors. The `KeyError` message indicates that none of the items in the key are found in the index, which is incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with ndarray or Index keys. We should modify the code to ensure that list-like keys are processed correctly without causing a KeyError during indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By handling list-like keys consistently with other types of keys, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and avoid the KeyError issue reported on GitHub.
