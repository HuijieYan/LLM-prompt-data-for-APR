### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc. 
2. The error message in the failing test suggests that there is an issue with indexing when passing a list, ndarray, Index, or Series key to the Series object `ser`.
3. The key type 'string' is inferred incorrectly, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access the Series with the key.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights inconsistency in behavior when indexing with lists compared to arrays and Index objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrect handling of a key that is a list, leading to a KeyError when attempting to access the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements that check the key type and its processing. Specifically, we need to ensure that a list key is correctly handled to prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this adjustment, we ensure that when a list key is passed to the `_get_with` function, it is correctly handled without causing a KeyError. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and resolve the failing test cases.
