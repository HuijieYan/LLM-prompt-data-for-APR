### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object in pandas. However, it fails to handle the case where the key is a list-like object. This causes an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of indexers like a NumPy array or a pandas Index object.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the Series object, leading to a KeyError due to incorrect handling of the list indexer. The function incorrectly expects the key to be a recognizable type like a NumPy array or a pandas Index object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly within the function. We should handle list-like key indexers the same way as other indexers, such as NumPy arrays or pandas Index objects.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled properly and consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests.
