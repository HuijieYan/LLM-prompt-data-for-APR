### Analysis:
The issue stems from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers (`list`, `array-like`, `Index`) are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The current implementation treats list indexers differently from other types in a way that leads to unexpected behavior and raises a `KeyError` when using a list indexer.

### Bug Cause:
1. The function incorrectly handles list indexers, leading to a `KeyError`.
2. The `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` check should include handling for `pd.Index` as well in order to cover all cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition checking for different types of indexers to ensure that `pd.Index` is handled along with other types.
2. Directly access the `key` values for the `list` case, similar to how it is done for other types like `np.ndarray` and `Index`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated condition to handle all types
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, pd.Index)):
        # Access key values directly for the list case
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including `pd.Index` in the type check and handling `list` indexers in a manner similar to other types, the corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases. It ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and eliminates the `KeyError` that was encountered previously.
