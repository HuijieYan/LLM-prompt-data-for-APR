### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` contains a conditional block that handles various key types for indexing a Series. The bug arises when the input key is a list-like object, and the function raises a `KeyError` instead of properly handling the indexing. This behavior is inconsistent with how other indexers are treated (array-like, Index, Series). It fails to handle a list indexer correctly, leading to test failures.

### Bug Location:
The bug is primarily located in the condition where a list-like key is checked, and it incorrectly raises a `KeyError`. This is the cause of the failing tests as it does not handle list-like objects properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like key is provided, the function handles it correctly and avoids raising a `KeyError`. We should modify the logic to handle list-like keys similar to how array-like, Index, and Series keys are handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these modifications, the function will properly handle list-like keys and avoid raising `KeyError`. This corrected version should pass the failing tests and align with the expected input/output behavior as described.
