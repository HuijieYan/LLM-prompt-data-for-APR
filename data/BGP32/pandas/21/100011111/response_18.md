### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs while indexing a Series. The bug occurs when using a list-like key, which leads to a KeyError with a message stating that none of the key values are found in the index.
2. The bug arises due to inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects compared to other types of indexers.
3. The function incorrectly processes list-like keys, leading to the KeyError, which was not the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue and the failing tests.
4. To fix the bug, the function should handle list-like keys similarly to other types of indexers to ensure consistent behavior.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the KeyError issue reported in the failing tests.

By making the appropriate adjustments in the function, we maintain consistency in indexing behavior across different types of keys in a Series.
