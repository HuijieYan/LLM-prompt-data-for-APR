### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there is an inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types like numpy arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely present in the section where the function tries to handle different types of key inputs. Specifically, the issue arises when dealing with a list type key input.

### Bug Explanation
When the function encounters a list-like key input, it attempts to use `self.loc[key]` to retrieve the values. However, for list-like key inputs, this results in a KeyError because it is not handling list indexers properly compared to other indexers like numpy arrays or Index objects. This inconsistency is causing the failing test cases.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like key inputs are handled appropriately like other indexers, such as numpy arrays or Index objects. We can modify the logic for list-like key inputs to avoid the KeyError by treating them consistently with other indexers.

### Corrected Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if the key is a list-like object or an ExtensionArray before directly using it as an indexer, we can handle list indexers properly and avoid the KeyError issue as reported in the failing test cases. This corrected function should resolve the inconsistency and pass the failing tests.
