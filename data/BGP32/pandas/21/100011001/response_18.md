### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a series. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The error messages indicate that the function is not handling these cases correctly and is not raising a KeyError when expected.

The function first checks if the key is a slice or a DataFrame, which seems to be working correctly. Then it checks if the key is a tuple and calls `_get_values_tuple`, which is not causing issues based on the error messages.

The problem seems to occur in the subsequent `if-elif` blocks where the function is trying to differentiate between different types of keys and perform appropriate actions based on the key type.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the key is a list `['C']`, but the function incorrectly identifies `key_type` as `'string'`.
2. In Case 2, the key is an ndarray, but the `key_type` is again incorrectly identified as `'string'`.
3. In Case 3, the key is an Index object, and `key_type` is properly derived as `'string'`, yet the error persists.
4. In Case 4, the key is a Series, and despite having the correct `key_type`, the function is still unable to handle the key properly.

The common issue in all cases is that the function incorrectly categorizes the key and fails to process it appropriately, leading to the KeyError not being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of key being used for indexing and handles different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) accordingly. We should update the logic in the function to correctly identify and process the key type to prevent the KeyError during indexing.

### Corrected Function
Here is a corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Correctly determine the key type
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring proper identification of the key type and handling different key types correctly, the corrected function should resolve the bug and allow the failing tests to pass successfully.
