The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is causing a `KeyError` when attempting to index a Series with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The bug lies in the incorrect handling of these types of keys in the function.

The bug arises because when the key is passed as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the function does not handle them properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to use them for indexing.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the key is one of those types, it is appropriately handled. We can modify the function to check the type of the key and handle each type correctly to prevent the `KeyError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling for different types of keys, ensuring that indexing with lists, ndarrays, Index, and Series does not lead to a `KeyError`. The `ensure_index` function is used to ensure that the key is treated consistently, and the correct indexing operation is performed.
