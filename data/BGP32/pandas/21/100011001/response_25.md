### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. However, it contains a bug that causes it to raise a `KeyError` in some cases, as indicated by the failing tests.

Looking at the function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue arises from incorrectly handling the input keys when they are np.array, pd.Index, or pd.Series. 

- In Case 1, the key is a list but is treated as a string internally, resulting in the wrong key type.
- In Case 2, the key is converted to an ndarray, which also results in the wrong key type.
- In Case 3, the key is an Index object, but the function fails to handle it correctly.
- In Case 4, the key is a Series, which is not properly processed.

The function should be modified to handle these different types of inputs correctly and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should adjust the handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function to ensure that the correct indexing behavior is followed for np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series inputs. We need to account for these different types and adjust the logic accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Try running the corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug has been successfully fixed and the `KeyError` is no longer raised.
