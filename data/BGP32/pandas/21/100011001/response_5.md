### Bug Description
The buggy function `_get_with` is encountering an issue when trying to retrieve values based on the key provided. The issue arises when the key is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The function is not properly handling these cases, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing tests.

### Bug Location
The bug lies in the logic that determines how to retrieve values based on the type of the key. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key in some cases, which leads to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the key when it is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series. The function is not treating these cases appropriately, leading to a KeyError when attempting to retrieve values from the Series.

### Fix Strategy
- Check the type of the key correctly to determine the proper action to take.
- Ensure that the function handles list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series cases correctly.
- Consider using built-in pandas functions to handle these data types appropriately.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")

    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

This corrected version checks the type of the key appropriately and ensures that the function handles different data types correctly, preventing the KeyError that was encountered in the failing tests.
