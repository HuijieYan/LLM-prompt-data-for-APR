### Bug Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different key types, specifically when the key is passed as a `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, or `Series`. The function is not correctly identifying the key behavior and selecting the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`). This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access the key in the Series.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Case 1, the key being a `list` is not handled correctly, leading to the `key_type` being identified as a `'string'`, which is incorrect.
2. In Case 2, the key being an `ndarray` is also not handled properly, resulting in the same issue with the `key_type`.
3. In Case 3, when the key is an `Index`, the `inferred_type` is correctly identified as a `'string'`, but this information is not utilized properly.
4. In Case 4, when the key is a `Series`, the function fails to handle it appropriately, leading to the same `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix
To correct the bug, we need to properly handle the different types of keys being passed to the `_get_with` function and select the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`). We should also ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified and used to determine the indexing behavior.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "floating"]:
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function now properly identifies the key type and uses it to select the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`). This should resolve the `KeyError` issues seen in the failing tests.
