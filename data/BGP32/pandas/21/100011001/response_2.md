### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series. The error messages indicate that the function is failing when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series type. The function appears to be incorrectly handling these types of keys, leading to a KeyError.

In the runtime values provided, the `key_type` variable is always inferred as `'string'`, regardless of the type of key being passed to the function. This suggests that the function is incorrectly categorizing the keys as strings instead of their actual types (list, ndarray, Index, Series).

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of list, ndarray, Index, or Series keys. The function does not properly recognize these types and ends up treating them as strings, leading to a KeyError when trying to index the Series.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the key type recognition in the function. Keys of types list, ndarray, Index, or Series should be identified and processed correctly based on their actual types. This can be achieved by modifying the key type checking logic to properly handle these types.

### Corrected Version
Below is the updated and corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

        # distinguishing between integer and other types
        index_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if index_type in {'integer', 'mixed-integer'}:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif index_type == 'boolean':
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version:
- Keys of types list, np.ndarray, Index, and Series are properly recognized and handled based on their respective types.
- The `ensure_index` function is used to ensure that the key is converted into an Index object for consistency.
- The key type inference logic is updated to categorize keys into correct types (integer, boolean, or others) for appropriate indexing behavior.
