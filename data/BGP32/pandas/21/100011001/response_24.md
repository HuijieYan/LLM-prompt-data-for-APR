### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` values for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of `key` and applies different logic accordingly. However, there are several issues causing the function to fail during testing.

1. In the first `if` block, the function incorrectly raises a `TypeError` if the `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which doesn't align with the intended functionality.
2. The function incorrectly handles scalar inputs in the `elif not is_list_like(key)` block by trying to access `self.loc[key]`.
3. In the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` block, the function incorrectly handles the case when `key` is already a list by converting it again to a list without any need.
4. The reasoning behind selecting between `self.loc[key]` and `self.iloc[key]` based on `self.index._should_fallback_to_positional()` is unclear and could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Remove the `ABCDataFrame` check to allow DataFrame-like key input.
2. Adjust the handling of scalar inputs to prevent raising errors.
3. Remove unnecessary list conversion for `key`.
4. Address the logic for selecting between `self.loc[key]` and `self.iloc[key]` to ensure consistency and proper indexing behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should handle the different types of input `key` values more effectively and pass the failing test cases.
