### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug likely arises from the logic used to determine the key type and how it is handled in the subsequent steps. 

1. The key type is inferred using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`, and it seems to always result in `'string'` based on the runtime values provided.
2. The key type `'string'` is not being correctly handled in the following logic, leading to the incorrect handling of the key and resulting in a `KeyError`. 

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic that deals with the inferred key type `'string'`. We should ensure that when the key type is `'string'`, it is appropriately handled by the function to prevent the `KeyError`. 

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly handling the key type `'string'` by calling `self.loc[key]`, the corrected function should now properly handle the cases where the inferred key type is a string and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.
