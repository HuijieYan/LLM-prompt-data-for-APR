### Bug Analysis
The bug is likely related to how the function handles the `key` parameter, especially when it is passed as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function tries to determine the `key_type` based on the input `key`, but it may not be handling the different types of keys properly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
- In Case 1, the input `key` is a list `['C']`. The `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, which should ideally be inferred as `'object'` or something else. This incorrect inference could lead to the wrong path being chosen in the subsequent steps, leading to a KeyError.
  
- In Case 2, the input `key` is an ndarray `array(['C'], dtype=object)`. The `key_type` is inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect. Once again, this incorrect inference could lead to the wrong path selection.
  
- In Case 3, the input `key` is an Index `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`. The `key_type` is determined correctly based on `key.inferred_type` as `'string'`, but it seems that the subsequent logic based on `key_type` is still incorrect.
  
- In Case 4, the input `key` is a Series `0    C dtype: object`. The `key_type` is inferred as `'string'`, which is once again incorrect.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of `key` (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and handles each case appropriately. We should also ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred to guide the function's logic in selecting the correct path.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making these changes, the function should be able to correctly handle different types of `key` inputs and infer the appropriate `key_type` for decision-making throughout the function.
