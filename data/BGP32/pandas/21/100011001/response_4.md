### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of the `key` parameter. The function checks if the `key` is an instance of various types and tries to determine the appropriate course of action based on its type. In the failing tests, when `key` is of type `list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`, the function encounters issues with the indexing process. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised during the test execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the different types of `key` parameters correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that indexing is done properly based on the type of `key`. We should also handle the case where the `key` is a list-like object appropriately to avoid the `KeyError` being raised.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the `key` parameter is correctly handled based on its type and converting certain types to `Index` or `int` format where necessary, the corrected function should now be able to handle different types of inputs without raising a `KeyError`.
