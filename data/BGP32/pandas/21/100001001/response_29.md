The bug in the provided function lies in the condition where the type of key is checked against "integer" and then treated as positional or label-based indexer for the Series data.

The issue arises because the function incorrectly identifies the key as a "string" rather than an "integer." This misclassification leads to the wrong handling of the key, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to update the key_type check and handling logic to correctly identify the type of key before deciding on the positional or label-based indexing approach.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key, key_type = ensure_platform_int(key), lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have included a check to ensure the correct type inference for the key before proceeding to the positional or label-based indexing. This modification should address the bug and correctly handle the different types of keys passed to the function.
