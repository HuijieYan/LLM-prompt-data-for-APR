### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrectly assigning the `key_type` variable based on the type of the provided `key`. The code is assuming that certain keys are of type `integer` or `list`, leading to inconsistent handling of these keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should first determine the type of the `key` and handle it accordingly. The function should correctly identify different types of keys, such as strings, arrays, and indexes. By updating the logic to correctly identify the type of `key` and handle each case appropriately, we can ensure consistent behavior of the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        if key_type == "integer":
            indexer = key
        else:
            indexer = ensure_index(key)
        if not self.index.is_positional(indexer):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
  
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We added additional logic to handle `key_type == "string"` cases, where we convert the string key to an index before checking if it should be treated as positional or label-based indexing.
- We resolved the inconsistencies in handling keys of different types by ensuring proper differentiation and processing based on the inferred type of the key.
