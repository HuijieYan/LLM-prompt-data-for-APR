The bug in the function `_get_with` is caused by incorrectly inferring the `key_type` variable based on the input `key`. The current implementation sets `key_type` to `'integer'` in the case that the type inferred by `lib.infer_dtype` is not equal to `'boolean'`.

To fix this bug, we should compare the `key_type` against the desired types and handle each case accordingly. Based on the runtime values and types provided, we see that the types inferred for the key are strings, not integers, which leads to incorrect behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == 'integer':
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the specific case of `'string'` type for the key separately and utilize the `self.loc[key]` method to retrieve the correct values.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle the different types of keys and return the expected results for each input case.
