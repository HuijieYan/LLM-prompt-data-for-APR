The bug in the `__get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys and determining the `key_type`. The bug arises because the function incorrectly assumes the `key_type` is always set to `'string'` regardless of the actual type of the key input. This leads to incorrect behavior further in the function based on this incorrect assumption.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to correctly infer the `key_type` based on the type of the key input. In the provided cases, it seems that the `key` input can be of various types like list, ndarray, or Index, so we should handle each case appropriately to determine the `key_type` accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the `__get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = 'unknown'

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version introduces a new check to determine the `key_type` based on the different types of keys. It should now properly infer the `key_type` and avoid the incorrect behavior due to the assumptions made in the original code.
