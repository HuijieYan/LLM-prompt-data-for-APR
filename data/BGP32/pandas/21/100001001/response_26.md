The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect identification of the key type, causing unexpected behavior based on this misidentification.

### Error Location:
The key type is inferred using the `lib.infer_dtype` function, which is causing the issue in determining the correct type of key in various scenarios.

### Cause of the Bug:
In all the provided test cases, the key type is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, leading to an improper route in the conditional checks later in the function. This misidentification results in the wrong branch being taken within the function, leading to incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is crucial to correctly identify the type of the key being passed to the function. As the key is either a list or ndarray representing indices, it should be treated differently than strings. By properly checking the type of the key and controlling the flow accordingly, the function can return the expected results.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes handling the key type correctly, ensuring that the function works as expected for the provided input scenarios.
