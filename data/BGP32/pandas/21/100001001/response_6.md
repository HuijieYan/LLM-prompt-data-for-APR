The issue in the buggy function lies in the block of code where the key_type is identified. The function incorrectly identifies the key_type as "string" in all cases, which leads to inappropriate handling of the keys later on.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly infer the key_type based on the type of the key variable that is being passed to the function. We can make use of the pandas functions to accurately determine the key_type for different types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the incorrect `key_type = 'integer'` assignment and replaced it with the proper inference based on the key's type in each case.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly for different types of keys passed as input.
