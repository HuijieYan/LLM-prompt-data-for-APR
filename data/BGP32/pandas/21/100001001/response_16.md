The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the misclassification of the key type in some cases, leading to the incorrect handling of the input key. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'` when it should have been classified as a list-like object for proper indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for identifying the `key_type` and handle the key appropriately based on its type. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):          
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key` is explicitly converted to a list if it's not list-like or if it's a string. This ensures that the key is handled properly in all cases to avoid misclassifications. Additionally, the key type identification logic is retained to make decisions based on the actual type of the key.
