The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrectly identifying the type of the key input, leading to the wrong branch of the code being executed. The function mistakenly sets `key_type` to `'string'` in all the cases, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to properly determine the type of the `key` input based on its actual type. Utilizing the information provided in the runtime values of the input parameters and relevant variables, we can address the bug as follows:

1. Identify the type of the `key` input correctly by checking its type using isinstance for each relevant type.
2. Update the logic to handle the identified type of `key` appropriately.
3. Return the desired result based on the corrected type identification.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By accurately determining the type of the `key` input and adjusting the logic accordingly, this corrected version should resolve the bug and provide the expected output for the provided test cases.
