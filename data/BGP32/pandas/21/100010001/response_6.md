### Analysis
The error messages indicate that the tests are failing due to a `KeyError` not being raised when attempting to access a key that is not present in the series index. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for indexing the series data. 

### Potential Error Locations
1. The function uses different conditional blocks to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists. The bug might be in one of these blocks based on the error messages.
2. The condition checking for `not is_list_like(key)` and returning `self.loc[key]` might be causing the issue.
3. The conditional block for `key_type == "integer"` could be handling the keys incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when trying to index the series with a key that is not present in the series index. The function does not correctly handle this situation and does not raise a `KeyError` as expected by the tests.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is not present in the series index, a `KeyError` is raised, as expected by the test cases.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key {key} not found in the index")

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is in Index format
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that if the key is not present in the series index, a `KeyError` is raised. This should resolve the issues raised by the failing test cases.
