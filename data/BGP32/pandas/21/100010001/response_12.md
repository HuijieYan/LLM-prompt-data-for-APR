### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is intended to handle various types of input keys and return the corresponding values from the Series. The failing tests indicate that there is an issue with how the function handles input keys of different types.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the part of the function where it checks the type of key and tries to return values accordingly. The handling of `key` of type `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, and other list-like types is inconsistent and leads to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
1. When `key` is of type `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, or a list-like type, the function does not properly handle them, leading to a `KeyError` in subsequent indexing operations (`ser[key]`).
2. The function lacks proper handling or conversion for these specific types of keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that for `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, or other list-like types, the function treats them appropriately based on their type.
2. Handle conversions between key types in a consistent manner to ensure that the subsequent indexing operation does not raise a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version of the function includes checking `is_scalar(key)` for handling scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`. By using `ensure_index(key)`, we ensure that the key is converted to an Index type, regardless of its original type. This consistent handling helps avoid the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing tests.
