1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexing operations on a pandas series. The function is attempting to take the key in the form of `box` and perform operations based on its type. The error messages indicate that there is a problem with the indexing operation when the key is in the form of a list, numpy array, pandas Series, or pandas Index.

2. The potential error locations in the code include the handling of keys not recognized as list-like, the conversion of keys to a list when not recognized as appropriate types, and the subset of the key based on its inferred type.

3. The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the keys and their types. The error messages suggest that none of the key values provided actually match the index of the series, resulting in a `KeyError`. This points to a problem with how the indexing operation is being performed.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the function to improve how it handles the different key types and ensure that the correct indexing operation is applied based on the key type.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) or isinstance(key, (float, np.floating)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- Check if the key is a scalar or floating point number and use `self.loc[key]` if so.
- Use `ensure_index(key)` to ensure the key is an index-casted object.
- Deal with integer or mixed-integer keys appropriately.
- Return `self.loc[key]` for list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index keys.
- Default to `self.reindex(key)` if none of the above cases are applicable.

This corrected version should address the issue with the key not matching the index and resolve the `KeyError` raised in the failing test cases.
