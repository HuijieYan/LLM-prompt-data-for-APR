### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is not correctly handling different types of keys being passed to it. The error messages indicate that the function is failing to handle cases where the key is of type `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The `elif not is_list_like(key):` condition might not be handling certain key types correctly.
2. The checks for `isinstance(key, Index)` and `isinstance(key, list)` are not correctly handling these cases for the given key types.
3. The function should differentiate between different types of keys to decide whether to use `loc` or `iloc`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by not handling various key types correctly within the function. The function encounters issues with handling different key types, leading to KeyError during indexing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Separate the logic for different key types to appropriately use `loc` or `iloc`.
2. Ensure key types like `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` are properly handled.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles different types of keys appropriately, including lists, arrays, indexes, and series. It should address the issues that were causing KeyError during indexing for the provided test cases.
