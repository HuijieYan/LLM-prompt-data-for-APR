**Bug Analysis:**
In the buggy function `_get_with`, the conditional check for the `key` type is not accurately capturing all the possible scenarios. The function is attempting to handle different data types for the `key` parameter but, due to incorrect conditions, it is not providing the expected behavior. This is causing the failing tests to show `KeyError`.

**Bug Location:**
The issue is present in the initial type checking logic for the `key` parameter. The function does not correctly categorize the input key type, leading to improper behavior downstream.

**Cause of the Bug:**
1. When `key` is a Series (which is actually a pandas data structure), the function tries to interpret the input as a list or ndarray, which leads to an incorrect evaluation.
2. The function expects different data types for `key` and tries to handle them differently, but the conditions are not accurately segregating the types.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly identify the type of the `key` parameter and handle each type separately to ensure correct behavior. Refactoring the code by reviewing each conditional check and accurately categorizing the possible types of `key` would resolve the bug.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function includes accurate type checking and handling of different types for the `key` parameter. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected for various `key` types, resolving the issue causing the failing tests.
