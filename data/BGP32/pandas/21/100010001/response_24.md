### Analysis:
The function `_get_with` within the `series.py` file of the pandas library is designed to fetch items using various types of keys. The typical error message encountered in the failing tests is due to an incomplete implementation of handling different types of keys like a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. 

#### Identified Issues:
1. The function is not properly handling the key types.
2. The specific condition for handling key as `Index` is missing.
3. The function is not handling the case when the key is a `list`, which leads to the test failures.

### Bug Explanation:
The key not being handled correctly in the function `_get_with` leads to failures in retrieving values using different types of keys like lists, ndarrays, Index, or Series. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised as the key is not found in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Add a condition to handle keys of type `Index`.
2. Modify the conditions to properly handle cases of keys being lists or non-list-like.
3. Ensure that the function can handle various key data types correctly to prevent failures and errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the necessary conditions to handle different types of keys correctly, which should ensure that the function works as intended and passes the failing tests.
