The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is that it doesn't handle the case where the key passed is a pandas `Index` or `Series`. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access items from the Series based on the key provided.

To fix this bug, we need to include additional conditions to handle cases where the key is an instance of `Index` or `Series`. We should first check for these concrete types before checking for generic types like `list`, `np.ndarray`, etc.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries) or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.to_list()
     
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional conditions to handle cases where the key is an instance of ABCSeries or Index, converting them to a list before further processing. Now, the function should be able to handle different types of keys, like Index and Series, without causing a `KeyError`.
