### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where `key` is an instance of `Index` correctly. The function is checking if `key` is an instance of `Index` but is not handling the case where `key` is an instance of `Index`. This results in the function not behaving as expected when `key` is an instance of `Index`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is checking if `key` is an instance of `Index` and then trying to extract the `inferred_type` from `key`. However, the logic flow is incorrect, and the check for an instance of `Index` is not handled properly in the if-else chain of the function. This leads to incorrect behavior when `key` is an instance of `Index`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to explicitly handle the case where `key` is an instance of `Index` in the function. We should check if `key` is an instance of `Index` before any other checks that rely on the `inferred_type` of `key`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

After applying the fix above, the function should be able to properly handle the `key` instance of `Index` and avoid the bug that was leading to the failing tests.
