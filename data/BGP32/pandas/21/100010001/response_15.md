### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is experiencing issues due to incorrect handling of different types of keys (e.g., list, np.ndarray, Index, Series). This function aims to determine the appropriate action based on the type of key provided, whether to locate values by label or by position.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the segment of the code handling `Index` objects. The current code fails to properly differentiate between keys of different types and causes the function to return unexpected results or raise errors, causing test failures.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the key.
2. If the key is an `Index` or `Series`, handle it appropriately.
3. Ensure that the action taken based on the key type aligns with the goal of the function and does not lead to errors.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle different types of keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now properly handles keys of different types, especially `Index` and `Series`, ensuring that the function operates as intended without raising errors or causing unexpected behavior. This correction should address the failing tests and improve the function's overall reliability.
