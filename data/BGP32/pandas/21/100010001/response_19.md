#### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of inputs for indexing a Series. The test cases that are failing are due to the fact that the function is not correctly handling some specific types of inputs like lists, numpy arrays, Pandas Series, and Index objects.

#### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters inputs like lists, numpy arrays, Pandas Series, or Index objects, and doesn't handle them correctly. The function logic tries to handle these types of inputs in a general way without considering the specific actions needed for each type.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the input types properly based on their characteristics. Specifically, the function should have separate logic to handle Pandas Series and Index objects, numpy arrays, and lists. This will prevent the failing test cases from raising errors.

#### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function includes proper handling of different input types, especially lists, numpy arrays, Pandas Series, and Index objects. By using `ensure_index` and additional `is_list_like` checks, the function now correctly identifies and handles the input types to prevent the failing test cases from raising errors.
