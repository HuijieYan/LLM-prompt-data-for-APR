### Analysis:
1. The error message from the failing test indicates that the test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised, but no error is being raised.
2. The test is meant to check the behavior for indexing a Series with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
3. The bug lies in the `_get_with` method where the logic for handling different types of keys is incomplete.
4. The bug is likely caused due to the function not handling the `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, or non-list-like keys correctly.
5. The function should be modified to properly handle these key types and raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic inside the `_get_with` method to properly handle different key types, including `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and non-list-like keys.
2. Ensure that a `KeyError` is raised if the key is not found in the index.
3. Use appropriate condition checks to distinguish between different key types and act accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert to list

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self._index}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now handles different key types properly and ensures that a `KeyError` is raised if the key is not found in the index. The function should now pass the failing test cases.
