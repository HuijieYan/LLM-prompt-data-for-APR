### Analysis:
The error message is asserting that a KeyError should be raised when trying to access a value in a Series using an index that does not exist in the Series. This indicates that the bug is likely in the indexing logic of the `_get_with` function, where an incorrect index is being used.

### Identified Issue:
- The bug is likely in the section that decides how to handle different types of keys. Specifically, when converting a given key into a list, numpy array, or Index before processing it, there seems to be a logic error.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the given key, resulting in erroneous indexing or reindexing behavior that does not align with the expected behavior of selecting elements from a Series using the correct index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that the key is correctly converted to the desired type for indexing before processing it further. Make sure that the conversion to a list, numpy array, or Index is done correctly based on the type of the key provided.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Removed the redundant check for `isinstance(key, Index)` before inferring the key type.
- Simplified the logic for converting the key to a list when needed.
- Removed the check for `is_integer` since this was merged with `infer_dtype` for key type inference.
- Made sure to properly handle the key type and conversion based on the inferred type for correct indexing behavior.
