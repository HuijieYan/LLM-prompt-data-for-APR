### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to perform various operations based on different types of input `key` provided. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a key error raised when attempting to index the `Series` object.

### Bug:
The bug arises when the `key` is of type `Index`, `list`, or `Series`, leading to incorrect handling in the code block. As per the bug, the function is unable to handle these specific types of `key` correctly, thus causing a key error during indexing.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code block that handles `Index`, `list`, and `Series` cases appropriately. By converting these types of keys to `list` first, we can ensure that the correct type is passed for indexing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By converting the `key` to a list early in the function and ensuring proper handling of different cases, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test scenarios.
