## Analyzing the buggy function and error message
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a pandas Series. The function contains conditional statements to handle various scenarios such as slicing, indexing with a DataFrame, tuple, list-like keys, etc.

The error messages from the failing tests all indicate that a `KeyError` is not being raised when trying to index a Series with a specific type of key (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The tests expect a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access elements that are not present in the Series.

## Identifying potential errors
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` might not be handling all non-list-like keys correctly, leading to an incorrect path in the code execution.
2. The conditional block `if isinstance(key, Index):` may not be correctly detecting the type of key passed.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, list):` might not be deducing that the key is a list correctly.

## Cause of the bug
The bug might be caused by incorrect branching in the conditional statements that determine how to fetch the values based on the type of key provided. This could be leading to the wrong code block being executed, failing to raise a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent values.

## Strategy to fix the bug
1. Modify the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` to ensure it correctly detects non-list-like keys.
2. Refactor the condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` to accurately identify the type of the key.
3. Adjust the condition `if isinstance(key, list):` to correctly recognize keys that are lists.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if not is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the modifications above, the function should now correctly handle different types of keys for indexing a pandas Series and raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the Series.
