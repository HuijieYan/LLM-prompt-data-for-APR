### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The error messages from the failing tests suggest that there is an issue in the key handling logic leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements using certain types of keys.

### Identified Issue:
The buggy function has an issue with handling specific types of keys: `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`. The code attempts to convert the key into a list implicitly using `list(key)` before proceeding with the indexing logic, which may not work as intended for these specific types.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the explicit conversion of the key into a list in the line `key = list(key)` without checking if the key is already an array-like type. This conversion potentially causes issues when trying to index the Series using numpy arrays, Pandas indexes, or Pandas series directly.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is an array-like type (`np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) before converting it into a list.
2. If the key is not array-like, convert it into a list.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, arrays like `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`, and `ExtensionArray` are explicitly cast to lists only when it is necessary for the subsequent indexing logic. This should resolve the `KeyError` issues observed in the failing tests.
