### Bug Explanation
In the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class, there is an issue when handling indexers that are lists. The problem arises when using a list indexer that does not match any values in the Series index. The bug results in a `KeyError` being raised incorrectly for list indexers, which is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of indexers (e.g., arrays, Index objects).

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic related to list indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should handle list indexers in a similar way to other types of indexers to ensure consistency in the error handling behavior when the indexer does not match any values in the Series index.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug described above:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation of Changes
- Added the `ensure_index` function to ensure that the list indexer is converted into an Index object for consistent handling.
- Removed the check for `Index` class since the conversion to Index is now performed for all list-like objects.
- Changed the logic to directly infer the key type from the list-like indexer.
- Simplified the conditional blocks for different types of indexers to handle list indexers uniformly.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised incorrectly.
