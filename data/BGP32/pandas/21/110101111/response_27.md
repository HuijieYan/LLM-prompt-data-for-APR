## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when handling different types of indexers. Specifically, when using an index key in the form of a list, the function throws a `KeyError` even though it should handle this case similarly to other types of indexers. This behavior inconsistency leads to failing tests and was brought up in GitHub issue #5880.

The bug arises due to incorrect handling of different types of indexers in the function. When encountering a list indexer, the function fails to process it correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to handle list indexers similar to other types of indexers. Ensure that list indexers are processed correctly to avoid the `KeyError` and maintain consistency with other indexers handling.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(list(key), skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of list indexer
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic within the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers, the bug should be resolved. The corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and maintain consistency with other types of indexers processing.
