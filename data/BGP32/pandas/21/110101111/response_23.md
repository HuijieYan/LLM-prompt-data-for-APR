### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior when trying to access a key that doesn't exist in the Series index.
3. The bug occurs because the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, which leads to inconsistencies in behavior.
4. The runtime variables `key` and `key_type` are not being handled correctly in the buggy function, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency results in a KeyError when trying to access a key that doesn't exist in the Series index.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that list indexers behave the same as other array-like indexers to maintain consistency.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        
    key = np.asarray(key)  # Convert key to numpy array for consistent indexing
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

By converting the `key` to a numpy array and ensuring that all array-like indexers are treated consistently, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and behave predictably for all types of indexers.
