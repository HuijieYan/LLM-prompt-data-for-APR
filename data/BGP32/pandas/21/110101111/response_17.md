Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in how different types of indexers are handled within the `_get_with` function. The function is not treating all types of indexers consistently, which leads to a KeyError in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all types of indexers in a uniform way. Specifically, we need to make sure that the function can handle list-like indexers without raising errors.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    raise TypeError(
        "Unsupported indexer type"
    )
```

This corrected version should handle different types of indexers consistently and prevent the KeyError that was occurring in the failing test cases.
