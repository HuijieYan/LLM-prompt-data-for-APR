## Analysis
1. The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` function, which is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing the series.
2. The bug occurs when a key of type list is passed to the function, causing it to incorrectly handle the input key.
3. In the failing test, the expectation is that the function should handle a key of type list correctly, but it fails to do so due to the bug in the logic.
4. The bug results in an incorrect determination of the `key_type` and leads to the function returning an incorrect result.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a key of type list is passed, it is handled properly and is not converted to other types before processing.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the case when the key is of type list. This involves ensuring that the key is not converted to other types and that it is processed appropriately based on its list nature.

## Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should handle a key of type list correctly as expected by the failing test cases.
