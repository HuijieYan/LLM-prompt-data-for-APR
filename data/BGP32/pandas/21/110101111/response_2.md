## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of pandas has conditional branches for different types of input keys such as slice, `ABCDataFrame`, tuple, etc. 
2. The bug seems to arise when the input key is not recognized as a list-like object and falls into the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block. In this block, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which might throw a KeyError if the key is not found in the index.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is using a list-like object for the key, which ends up triggering the problematic branch of the code, leading to a KeyError as the expected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not list-like without causing a KeyError, especially when the key is a pandas Series object but internally converts to a string key.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to modify the condition checking for non-list-like keys to include a case for pandas Series objects, handling them appropriately.
2. If the key is an instance of a pandas Series, we should extract the actual value from the Series to use it for indexing instead of directly using the Series object.
3. By ensuring that the key is a valid index value, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring in cases like this.

## Bug-fixed version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the case where the key is a pandas Series object
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.iloc[0]  # Extract the first value from the Series as the key

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check for pandas Series objects and extracting the value for indexing, we can avoid the KeyError that was occurring due to incorrect handling of the input key. This fix should address the issue raised in the failing test case and align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.
