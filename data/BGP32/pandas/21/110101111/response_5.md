The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles certain types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior in different scenarios. The issue at hand is related to how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers, causing unexpected results and KeyError exceptions.

To fix this bug and provide a corrected version of the function, we need to modify the conditional logic for handling different types of indexers in a consistent manner. Specifically, we will adjust the code to handle list indexers in a way that aligns with how other array-like indexers are treated.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle non-list-like scalars
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle all list-like indexers in a consistent manner
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "boolean"):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now handles list-like indexers in a more uniform way, ensuring consistency across different types of indexers. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and addresses the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
