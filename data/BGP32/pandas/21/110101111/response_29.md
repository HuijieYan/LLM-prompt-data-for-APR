### Bug Fix:

The issue arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. To address this bug, we need to make sure that all types of indexers behave consistently when used with a `Series`. The cases that should be handled are arrays, lists, pandas Index objects, and pandas Series objects.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers (`list`, `array`, `Index`, and `Series`) are handled consistently, avoiding the KeyError issue raised in the failing test.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function now behaves consistently for all types of indexer inputs, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
