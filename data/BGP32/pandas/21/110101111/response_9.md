The buggy function `_get_with` has an issue when handling different types of keys for indexing the `Series`. The function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies and errors. 

The main issue arises when the `key` variable is not recognized as an array-like type, causing the function to incorrectly attempt to extract values from the `Series` based on the key type.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles all types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) in a consistent manner, similar to how other array-like indexers are treated. By modifying the conditional statements and properly identifying the type of the key, we can ensure that the correct indexing method is chosen based on the key's characteristics.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle key as an array-like object
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:  # Handle integers properly
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle other array-like types
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of keys are appropriately handled, avoiding inconsistencies and errors. It aligns the behavior of indexing with different types of keys to provide a more coherent and predictable outcome.
