## Analysis
1. The `Series._get_with()` function is responsible for handling different input types like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc., to retrieve values from the Series object.
2. In the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, different types of `key` parameters are passed to the `ser[key]` indexing operation, including list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The bug occurs due to the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers in the `_get_with()` function, leading to a KeyError when indexing with a list key, but not with other types.
4. The `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'integer'` in some cases where the key is actually of type `'string'`, leading to the incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure consistent handling of all array-like indexers in the `_get_with()` function to avoid the KeyError issue for list indexers.
2. Correctly identify the key type to determine whether it is a positional indexer or label-based indexer.
3. Modify the conditional statements to handle list keys appropriately.
4. The fix should align with the expected behavior mentioned in the failing tests.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "boolean", "string"]:
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By making the above corrections in the `_get_with()` function, the issue with the KeyError when indexing with a list key should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test cases mentioned earlier.
