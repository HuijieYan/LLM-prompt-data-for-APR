The issue lies in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where handling of different types of indexers is causing inconsistency in behavior. Specifically, the bug occurs when a list indexer is used and results in a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` like other array-like indexers.

The bug is related to how the function `_get_with` deals with different types of indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when a list indexer is encountered. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other indexers, which return `NaN` for missing values. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` further confirms the issue by expecting `NaN` instead of raising a `KeyError` for list indexers.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, returning `NaN` for missing values. This adjustment will align the behavior for different types of indexers and make it consistent with the expected output in the failing test.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):  # Modified condition to treat list-like indexers the same way
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now behave consistently for different types of indexers, including list indexers, by returning `NaN` for missing values. This change addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures that the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` passes as expected.
