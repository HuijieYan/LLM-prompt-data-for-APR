### Analysis:
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to handle various types of indexers when accessing elements from a series. The bug occurs when a list-like key is passed to the function, causing an error when attempting to access values from the series based on the key.

The issue stems from the fact that the function handles different types of indexers inconsistently, leading to unexpected behavior and errors, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
When a list-like key is passed to the `_get_with` function, the function tries to handle it as an index. However, the logic for handling list-like indexers is incorrect, leading to the KeyError as the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function to align with the behavior of other types of indexers and prevent the KeyError. By treating list-like indexers consistently with other types, we can ensure the correct behavior when accessing elements from the series.

### Bug-free Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_bool(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic for handling list-like indexers and ensuring consistency with other index types, the function should now correctly handle different types of key inputs and prevent the KeyError issue highlighted in the failing test case and GitHub issue.
