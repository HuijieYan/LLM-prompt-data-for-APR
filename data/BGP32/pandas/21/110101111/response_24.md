The issue at hand is caused by the inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers when used with a Series object. Specifically, the method `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling list-like indexers properly, leading to unexpected behavior and failures in the provided test cases.

The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like indexer is passed, the function does not handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError` exception. This inconsistent behavior is not in alignment with the expected behavior of other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are processed correctly within the `_get_with` function, similar to how other types of indexers are handled. We can achieve this by updating the conditional statements within the function to properly handle list-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling for list-like indexers, ensuring that they are processed correctly within the function. By making these adjustments, the function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected behavior specified in the GitHub issue.
