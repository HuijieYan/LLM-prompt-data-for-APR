## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index.
2. The bug occurs when dealing with indexers that are list-like. In particular, the issue arises when the input `key` is a list and it leads to an incorrect KeyError due to mishandling of list indexers.
3. The bug stems from the difference in how indexing is handled for list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior.
4. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the same behavior for list/ndarray/Index/Series indexers but encounters a KeyError in the list case, highlighting the bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. The bug fix should ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically addressing the incorrect KeyError raised for list-like indexers.
2. Modify the logic for list-like indexers to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers, ensuring that the expected KeyError is not raised when indexing with lists.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Ensure that all list-like indexers are converted to a list
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, preventing the erroneous KeyError and resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
