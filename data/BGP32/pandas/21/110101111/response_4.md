## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index`, leading to an incorrect handling of the key type.
3. The issue arises from the incorrect inference of the key type when it is an `Index`.
4. The bug causes a KeyError when attempting to reindex with a key of type `Index`, which deviates from the expected behavior in such cases.
5. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior for indexing with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series), which is not maintained due to the bug.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the key type when it is an `Index`.
2. Ensure that the behavior is consistent for all types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
3. Modify the key inference logic so that it accurately determines the key type, especially when the key is an `Index`.
4. Avoid raising a KeyError when reindexing with an `Index`.
5. Update the function to align with the expectations of the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_is_index = isinstance(key, Index)

    if key_is_index:
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the corrections as detailed above, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of keys consistently, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
