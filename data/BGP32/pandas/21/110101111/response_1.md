The issue in the buggy function `_get_with` lies in the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when the key is of type list for which the code is not correctly reindexing the Series. This causes a KeyError in certain cases, as seen in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a list, it is appropriately handled to avoid the KeyError. We can modify the code to treat list indexers similar to other types of indexers like ndarray or Index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self._get_values(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by handling list indexers similarly to other types of indexers like ndarray or Index. This approach ensures that the KeyError is not raised when dealing with list-like key input.

By implementing this fix, the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` should now pass as the Series object will be correctly indexed even when the key is a list.
