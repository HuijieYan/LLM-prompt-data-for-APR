### Explanation of the Bug:

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where the behavior of indexing with a list is different from indexing with other array-like indexers like ndarray, Index, and Series. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when indexing with a list. The expected behavior is to treat all indexers in a consistent manner.

### Bug Location:
The bug occurs in the section where verifying the type of the key and then performing different actions based on its type.

### Cause of the Bug:
- When an index key is a list, the function incorrectly attempts to handle it separately and fails to return the correct result.
- The logic for handling different types of keys is incomplete and does not cover all cases properly, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
- Update the function to handle list indexers in the same manner as other array-like indexers.
- Ensure that the key types are correctly recognized and processed accordingly.
- Avoid raising a `KeyError` for list indexers and provide a consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent behavior when indexing with different types of indexers, including lists. It avoids the `KeyError` encountered in the failing test cases.
