### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where the behavior when indexing with a list is different from indexing with other array-like structures like ndarray, Index, or Series. The issue arises due to inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, leading to a KeyError in the case of a list indexer.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the same behavior for various indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when used to index a Series. However, the current implementation of the `_get_with` function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to the KeyError.

The key is not being properly converted to the expected type in the function, causing the subsequent checks to fail and leading to an incorrect return value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior is consistent when indexing with different types of array-like structures. Specifically, we need to handle list indexers in a way that aligns with the behavior of other indexers like ndarray, Index, and Series.

We need to improve the conversion and handling of the key, ensuring that it is correctly interpreted to avoid the KeyError. Additionally, the key_type should be properly inferred and used to determine the indexing strategy within the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key is properly handled and converted for consistent behavior when indexing with different array-like structures within the `Series` class.
