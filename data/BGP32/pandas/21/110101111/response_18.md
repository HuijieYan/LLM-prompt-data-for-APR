The issue in the provided function `_get_with` arises from the handling of the input `key` when it is a list. The function incorrectly processes the list indexer, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases, as highlighted in the failing test.

The problem occurs when the function encounters a list indexer and tries to handle it like other array-like indexers, causing a mismatch with the actual behavior expected by the implementation. This discrepancy results in the `KeyError` when attempting to access elements not present in the index.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the logic for handling list indexers specifically to align with the expected behavior. By adjusting the conditional statements and handling the list index case appropriately, we can ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like indexers separately
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By specifically checking for list-like indexers early in the function and handling them appropriately, we can ensure that the function operates as expected and passes the failing test cases. This update aligns the behavior of list indexers with the intended functionality, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
