The issue stems from the behavior of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class when a list-like key is passed. The function handles different types of keys in specific ways, leading to inconsistency and causing the failing test cases.

The bug arises from the code block that checks if the key is not list-like. When keys such as scalars that aren't recognized by `lib.is_scalar` are encountered, the function attempts to access the `loc` attribute directly, which might not be suitable for all types of keys.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of non-list-like keys to ensure consistent behavior across different key types, especially when the key is a list. We should avoid directly accessing `self.loc[key]` in such cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are treated uniformly, avoiding the direct access of `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like keys. This modification should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and pass the failing test cases.
