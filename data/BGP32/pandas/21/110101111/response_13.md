The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `Series` class. When using list indexers, an error is raised even though the key is not in the index. This behavior differs from using array-like indexers, where missing keys result in NaN values. The difference in behavior causes confusion for users trying to index a `Series` with various indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. Specifically, we should handle list indexers similar to how array-like indexers are handled, ensuring that missing keys result in NaN values rather than raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index, ExtensionArray)):
        key = np.array(list(key))

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers by converting them to a numpy array if they are not already an array-like type. By doing this, inconsistent behavior between different indexers is eliminated, ensuring that missing keys in a list indexer will result in NaN values rather than raising errors, aligning it with the behavior of other indexers. This correction should address the GitHub issue and make the `Series` indexing behavior more consistent overall.
