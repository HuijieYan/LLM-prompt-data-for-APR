### Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of keys. The function contains a conditional block that checks if the key is not list-like and then tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`. This leads to a `KeyError` because the key might not be a valid index for the Series.

In the given runtime values, we see that the `key_type` is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, which is likely causing the function to try and use it as an index.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is valid for indexing the Series before attempting to use it. We can modify the conditional block that handles non-list-like keys to better handle different key types.

We can check if the key is a valid index type before trying to access it. If it's not a valid index type, we can return an error or handle the key appropriately based on its type.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    raise TypeError("Invalid key type for Series indexing")
```

This corrected version ensures that only valid index types are used for indexing the Series and raises a `TypeError` if the key type is not supported.
