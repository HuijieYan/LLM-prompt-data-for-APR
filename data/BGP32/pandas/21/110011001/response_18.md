### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the issue arises when a key that is not list-like is provided, such as a scalar or tuple. This causes the function to incorrectly try to access the `loc` attribute of the key, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the section of the code where there is a check for `not is_list_like(key)`. In this case, when the key is not list-like, the function incorrectly tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which is causing the KeyError when the key is not part of the index.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where a non-list-like key is provided differently. We can modify the code to directly return the `self.loc[key]` for scalar keys or convert other non-list-like keys, such as tuples, into lists before further processing.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert non-list-like keys, such as tuples, to lists
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle non-list-like keys correctly and ensure that the KeyError issue is resolved.
