### Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the way it handles the different types of `key` inputs. The function is supposed to return the value associated with the provided `key` but fails to do so in certain cases due to incorrect type handling.

1. In Case 1, the input `key` is a list `['C']`, but the function incorrectly identifies its `key_type` as `'string'` instead of handling it as a list.
   
2. In Case 2, the input `key` is provided as an ndarray, which is not properly handled by the function, leading to an incorrect `key_type` identification.

3. In Case 3, the input `key` is an `Index` object, and the inference of its type as `'string'` is incorrect.

4. In Case 4, the input `key` is a Series object, and the function incorrectly identifies its `key_type` as `'string'`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different types of `key` inputs, identifies their types accurately, and processes them accordingly.

### Fix:
I will correct the `_get_with` function by ensuring proper handling of different types of `key` inputs and accurate identification of their types. The corrected version is shown below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        
    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == 'integer':
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

By ensuring that `key` is converted to an `Index` object if it is not one already and properly handling the identification of its type, the function should now work correctly for the different types of `key` inputs provided in the test cases.
