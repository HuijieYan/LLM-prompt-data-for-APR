### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is meant to deal with different types of input keys for a Series object. The bug occurs when the input key is not recognized as a list-like object, causing a KeyError to be raised incorrectly.

1. In Case 1, the input key is a list but is not correctly identified as such, leading to an incorrect type assignment for `key_type`.
2. Similarly in Case 2, the input key is an ndarray but is not properly recognized as a list-like object.
3. In Case 3, the input key is an Index object, and the inferred type is incorrect, leading to the same issue.
4. In Case 4, the input key is a Series object which is not handled correctly, resulting in the same error.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of different types of input keys in the function `_get_with`. When the key is not recognized as a list-like object, it is incorrectly processed, leading to a KeyError being raised even though the key should exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of input keys are correctly identified and processed in the function. Specifically, we should correctly distinguish between list-like objects and other types of keys to avoid raising KeyErrors erroneously.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Corrected handling of different types of keys
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):  # Add isinstance(key, str) check
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the `isinstance(key, str)` check in addition to `is_list_like(key)`, we ensure that all types of list-like objects are correctly recognized and processed within the function. This should prevent the KeyError from being raised incorrectly and resolve the bug.
