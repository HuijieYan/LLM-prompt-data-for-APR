### Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of key inputs and retrieve corresponding values. The bug seems to be related to how different key types are processed. 

- In Case 1, the key is a list, but the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'`.
- In Case 2, the key is passed as an ndarray, but the `key_type` is again incorrectly inferred as `'string'`.
- In Case 3, the key is an `Index` object, and even though `key.inferred_type` correctly identifies it as `'string'`, the actual key processing logic seems to have issues.
- In Case 4, the key is a Series and the `key_type` is again incorrectly inferred as `'string'`.

The bug seems to stem from the point where different key types are being processed based on their inferred type. The code logic has issues in correctly identifying the key types and processing them accordingly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and processed. A more robust check and handling mechanism for different key types should replace the current logic. 

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "object":
            # handle the case when key is an Index or a Series
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")

``` 

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes improved handling logic for different key types to ensure correct identification and processing of keys, addressing the bugs identified in the buggy version.
