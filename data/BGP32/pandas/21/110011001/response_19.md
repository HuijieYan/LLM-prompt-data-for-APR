### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index`. The function incorrectly assigns the key_type as `"string"` for all types of keys, which leads to incorrect behavior downstream in the function.

### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from incorrectly inferring the data type of the key, which causes the function to choose the wrong indexing method. In all cases, the key_type is set to `"string"` due to the incorrect `lib.infer_dtype` method call. As a result, the function chooses the wrong indexing method, leading to KeyError when trying to access non-existent values in the Series object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the data type of the key. We should handle the case when the key is of type `Index` separately since the inferred type will not provide the correct information. By checking if the key is an instance of `Index`, we can avoid the incorrect inference and select the appropriate indexing method based on the key type.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        if key.inferred_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle keys of type `Index` and select the appropriate indexing method based on the key type, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests.
