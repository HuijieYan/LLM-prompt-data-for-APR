### Issue Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where the key is not found in the index causing a `KeyError` to be raised. This is due to incorrect handling of different types of keys passed to the function.

1. In Cases 1, 2, and 3, the key is of type list, ndarray, and Index ('C' in all cases), respectively, while the key type is incorrectly inferred as 'string'.

2. In Case 4, the key is a Series object, which leads to a KeyError due to incorrect key handling.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- The key type inference should be fixed to correctly identify the key types.
- Different key types need to be handled appropriately to prevent KeyError when looking for values in the index.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Correct key type inference
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the key type inference and the handling of different key types, the function should now correctly handle various types of keys passed to it, avoiding KeyError issues.
