The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of the `key` parameter. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the `key` input, which leads to incorrect processing and causes the test cases to fail.

The function follows a series of checks to determine the type of `key` and how to process it. However, in some cases, the function mismatches the type of `key` resulting in incorrect outcomes.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves properly identifying the type of `key` and processing it accordingly. By ensuring that the type of `key` is correctly identified, the function can execute the appropriate logic for that type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # If key is not a scalar, treat it as list-like
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index
    
    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # At this point, key should be a valid Index
    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- The function checks if the `key` is a scalar using `is_scalar` and processes it accordingly.
- Non-scalar values are converted to an Index type using `ensure_index`.
- It checks if the key is boolean using `is_bool` for direct processing.
- Proper checks are performed to differentiate between integer-based and label-based indexing, ensuring correct processing based on the type of `key`.

By applying these changes, the function should now correctly identify the type of `key` and handle it appropriately, resolving the issues seen in the failing test cases.
