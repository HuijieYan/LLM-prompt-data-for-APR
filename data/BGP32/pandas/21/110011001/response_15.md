### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The function contains multiple conditional statements to determine the type of key and apply the appropriate indexing method.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of non-list-like keys, leading to incorrect results and causing the error in the test cases.
4. The key_type is being inferred incorrectly as `'string'` regardless of the actual type of key provided in the test cases.
5. The buggy function should correctly identify the type of key provided and apply the relevant indexing method to fix the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to correctly identify and handle the type of key provided.
2. Ensure that the key_type is inferred accurately based on the type of key passed.
3. Implement a method to correctly handle non-list-like keys to avoid the error raised in the failing test cases.

### Bug-fixed Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
  
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the conditional logic and key-type inference, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now handle the different types of keys provided in the failing test cases.
