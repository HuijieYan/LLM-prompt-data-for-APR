### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is encountering issues when trying to handle different types of keys, particularly when the key is provided as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The bug seems to be related to the check for `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))`, which may not accurately capture all the possible valid key types.

The key type is incorrectly inferred to be a string in all provided cases, suggesting that the key type is not being correctly identified within the function. This incorrect inference leads to issues later in the function logic when trying to handle the key based on its type.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the inaccurate handling and identification of the key type within the function. The conditions and checks for different key types are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible valid key types, leading to incorrect assumptions about the key type and incorrect behavior in return.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we properly identify and handle different key types, including lists, ndarrays, Indexes, and Series. We should update the conditions and checks within the function to accurately determine the key type and execute the corresponding logic based on the identified type.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_with` function below:

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional checks to correctly infer the key type and adjust the logic based on the identified type, ensuring that the function can handle various key types appropriately.
