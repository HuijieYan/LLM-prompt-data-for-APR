### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` values and return the corresponding sliced data from the Series object. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the input `key` when it is of type `Index`.

### Bug Explanation
- In Cases 1, 2, and 3, the `key_type` is being inferred as `'string'` regardless of the actual type of key provided. This leads to incorrect slicing operations being performed on the Series object, resulting in a KeyError.
- The bug occurs because the type inference for `key_type` is not correctly handling the case when `key` is of type `Index`. This leads to incorrect indexing decisions in the subsequent logic flow of the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type inference process for `key_type` correctly identifies the type of the `key`, especially when the `key` is an `Index` object. This will allow for appropriate handling of the key data type in the subsequent operations.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            key_type = 'object'  # Correcting type inference for Series
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the type inference logic and considering the case when the input `key` is a `Series`, we can address the bug and ensure that the function operates correctly with various types of input keys.
