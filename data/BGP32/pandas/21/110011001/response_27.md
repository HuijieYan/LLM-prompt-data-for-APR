### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys for indexing a Series. However, the issue seems to be with the way it identifies the `key_type` before deciding the indexing strategy (using `loc` or `iloc`). The bug is causing the function to incorrectly identify the type of the key, leading to incorrect indexing operations.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function `_get_with` arises from the way it determines the `key_type` of the input key. In the cases provided:
- for Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3: the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` regardless of the actual type of the key.
- for Case 4: the key is transformed into a Series before passing it to the function.

This incorrect identification of the `key_type` leads to the function choosing the wrong indexing strategy (using `loc` or `iloc`). As a result, the function fails to raise a `KeyError` when attempting to index with invalid keys.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified for the input key based on its actual type.
2. Handle different types of keys appropriately to avoid incorrect indexing operations.
3. Make sure to raise a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, ABCSeries)):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key_type` is correctly identified and the key is handled appropriately for indexing a Series. This should address the bug and make the function work as intended.
