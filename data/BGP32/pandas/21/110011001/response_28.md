### Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
3. The bug seems to occur when dealing with certain types of keys, leading to a KeyError in the failing test cases.
4. The function seems to wrongly identify the type of the key input, causing it to take the wrong path in the conditional statements.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect identification of the type of the key input in the function. This incorrect identification results in the function taking the wrong branch of conditional statements and ultimately failing to perform the indexing correctly.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the key input is correctly identified and the corresponding actions are taken. In this case, the incorrect identification of the key type can be resolved by improving the conditional checks for the key type.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Fixing the bug in the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these corrections, we ensure that the type of the key input is correctly identified and the function takes the appropriate actions to index the Series correctly.
