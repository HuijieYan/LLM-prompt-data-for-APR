## Analysis
The `_get_with` function is intended to retrieve values from the Series based on different types of keys provided. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object. The function tries to determine the `key_type` based on the provided key, but for list-like keys, it incorrectly infers the type as `'string'` when it should consider looking at the individual elements of the list-like key to determine its actual type.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises because when the key is list-like, the function infers the type of the list rather than analyzing the type of elements within the list. This leads to incorrect handling of the key, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access the Series values with the key.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the part of the function responsible for inferring the type of the key. Instead of inferring the type of the entire list-like object, we should focus on the type of individual elements within the list to determine the key type accurately.

## Corrected Implementation
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_types = [lib.infer_dtype(k, skipna=False) for k in key]

    if all(key_type == "integer" for key_type in key_types):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, we now correctly determine the `key_types` by inspecting individual elements within the list-like key. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the function works correctly for list-like keys.
