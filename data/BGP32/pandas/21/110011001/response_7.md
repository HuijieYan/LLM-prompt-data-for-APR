### Analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic for handling different types of `key` inputs. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key, resulting in an incorrect branch being taken. This leads to a `KeyError` exception not being raised as expected in the test cases, causing the tests to fail.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function's logic assumes that the key is always a list-like object. However, in the failing test cases, different types of keys are being used, such as arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. The function does not correctly handle these cases, leading to the wrong behavior.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to correctly identify the type of the key input. We should check for various possible key types and handle each case appropriately.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function with the corrected code above, it should now correctly handle the different types of `key` inputs encountered in the failing test cases, ensuring that the appropriate logic is applied and the `KeyError` is raised when necessary.
