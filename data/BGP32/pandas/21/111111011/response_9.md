### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that has no matching values in the index.
3. The error occurs when a list-like key is passed to the Series's indexer, leading to a `KeyError` because the handling of list indexers is inconsistent compared to other array-like indexers.
4. The runtime values show that the key type is being inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect and leads to improper handling of the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The key inference should be corrected to handle list-like keys properly in the `_get_with` function.
2. Update the logic to ensure that list-like keys are treated consistently with other array-like keys to resolve the issue identified in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these modifications, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other array-like keys, resolving the issue reported in the failing test.
