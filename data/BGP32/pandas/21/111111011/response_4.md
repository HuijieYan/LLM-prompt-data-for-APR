### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas` Series class is not handling the case where the key is a list of items properly. It is treating the list differently from other array-like indexers, which results in the KeyError being raised erroneously.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` creates a Series `ser` with values `['A', 'B']` and attempts to select a non-existent item `'C'` from the Series using different data types for the key (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). When a list key is used, it raises a KeyError while other data types behave differently.

The error message `KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"` indicates that the key 'C' is not found in the index, but the test expects the behavior to be consistent across different data types for the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function treats list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers. This will align the behavior with the expectation in the failing test and resolve the inconsistency.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers the same way as other array-like indexers
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

Applying this corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the issue and make the behavior consistent across different data types for the key, passing the failing test and aligning with the expectation.
