The issue arises from the inconsistent behavior when indexing a pandas Series with different types like list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case when the key is a list properly, resulting in a KeyError in certain scenarios.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When the input key is a list, the current implementation of the `_get_with` function fails to handle it correctly.
2. The function wrongly infers the `key_type` as "integer" which is incorrect for a list key.
3. As a result, it incorrectly falls into the block that leads to a KeyError when trying to access `self.loc[key]`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for list-like keys to ensure it is correctly handled. We should also check for list type specifically to avoid any erroneous assumptions.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the condition for list-like keys and ensuring proper handling of list type specifically, the corrected version should now properly handle all types of key inputs and resolve the KeyError issue in the failing tests.
