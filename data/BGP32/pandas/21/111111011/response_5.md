### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test is trying to index a Series with a key that is different from the other types of keys handled by the function.
3. The error message indicates that when indexing with a list key, it raises a `KeyError` instead of returning NaN for missing values.
4. The `key_type` variable is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which indicates a potential issue with inferring the key type.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a list key compared to other types of keys.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. The function is not properly converting the list-like key to an appropriate format for indexing the Series.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are properly handled to avoid raising a `KeyError` and instead return NaN for missing values. Additionally, we need to correctly infer the type of the key to determine the indexing strategy to use.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = np.array(key) if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = None # Clear the previous incorrect type inference
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle the case of indexing with a list-like key
        return self.reindex(key, fill_value=np.nan)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes outlined above, the corrected `_get_with` function should now properly handle indexing with list-like keys and return NaN for missing values, resolving the issue described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
