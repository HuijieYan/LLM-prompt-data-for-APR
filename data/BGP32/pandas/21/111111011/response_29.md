## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the Series class of the Pandas library is causing the failing tests due to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series object with different types of indexers. The issue arises when using a list as an indexer, which results in a KeyError, unlike other array-like indexers.

Here are the observations from the bug analysis:
1. The function checks the type of the key being used for indexing and handles different types differently (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple).
2. The problem occurs when the key is not list-like, where it falls back to `self.loc[key]`. However, this approach triggers an error for list indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure consistent behavior for different indexers, we need to modify the handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other array-like indexers.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray)):
        # handle scalars that are unrecognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

## Summary of Changes
- In the block handling non-list-like keys, added `or isinstance(key, np.ndarray)` to include other array-like types along with lists.
- Replaced `self.loc[key]` with `self.iloc[key]` in the list indexer branch to ensure consistency with other array-like indexers.

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the failing tests related to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers should pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
