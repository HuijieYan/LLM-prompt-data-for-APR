## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library has a conditional block that checks the type of the `key` parameter and performs different actions based on its type. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles an array-like key (e.g., list, numpy array, Index, Series) when passed to the Series.

From the failing test and the runtime values, it can be observed that when the `key` is an array-like object (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`), the function fails to return the correct result or handle the key appropriately. The function results in a `KeyError` even though the key is present in the index.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should handle the array-like keys (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) properly along with other supported key types in the `_get_with` function. We need to ensure that the function correctly retrieves the values corresponding to the provided keys.

Based on the inputs, the correct behavior should return the values corresponding to the keys when using different array-like objects as keys.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes handling different array-like keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and ensures proper retrieval of values based on the keys passed to the Series.

By updating the conditional statements to include the handling of array-like keys, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test.
