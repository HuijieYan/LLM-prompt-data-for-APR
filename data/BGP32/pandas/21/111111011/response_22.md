### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs, but it fails to properly handle a key input that is a list-like object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tests the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that has no matches in the index, leading to a KeyError raise when using a list-like key input.

### Bug Explanation
1. When the `_get_with` function encounters a list-like key input, it tries to handle it as a scalar, leading to an incorrect access attempt using `self.loc[key]`.
2. The failing test specifically tests the behavior of indexing a Series with a list-like key (which has no matching items in the index), causing a KeyError to be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle list-like key inputs in the `_get_with` function by addressing this specific case.
2. We should modify the logic to handle list-like keys appropriately to avoid KeyError raising when the key is not found in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Corrected to handle scalar values as list-like

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, it now correctly handles list-like key inputs, resolving the KeyError issue raised during the failing test cases.
