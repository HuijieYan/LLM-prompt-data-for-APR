The issue stems from the `_get_with` function in the `pandas` library, particularly in the handling of different types of key indexers such as lists, arrays, and indexes. The function fails when receiving certain types of key input, leading to a `KeyError` in cases where a `list` is used as an indexer.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers properly to align with the expected behavior. It seems that the function is not correctly handling lists as indexers, which is causing the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
```

By checking if the key is list-like directly using `is_list_like(key)` and returning `self.loc[key]`, the corrected function will correctly handle list indexers and avoid the `KeyError` that was occurring before.

This fix aligns with the GitHub issue's discussion about inconsistent behavior when using different types of indexers. Now, the `_get_with` function should properly handle list indexers and pass the failing tests without raising a `KeyError`.
