### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key input for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses various types of `box` input (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) to index a Series object, resulting in a `KeyError`.
3. The issue arises from how the `_get_with` function handles the different types of keys, causing inconsistency in behavior when using list-like inputs for indexing.
4. The key_type inferred incorrectly as `'string'` is indicative of the bug causing incorrect type inference.
5. Considering the failing test, the buggy function needs to handle list-like inputs properly to avoid the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to handling list-like keys differently in the `_get_with` function compared to other types of keys. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when indexing using a list in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys correctly by ensuring consistent behavior across different types of keys.
2. Update the logic to handle list-like keys based on their inferred type to avoid raising `KeyError` when indexing using lists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like keys consistently with other key types, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
