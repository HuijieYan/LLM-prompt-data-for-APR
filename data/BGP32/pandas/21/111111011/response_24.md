## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` package is encountering an issue when the input `key` is a list-like object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior when accessing a non-existent key in a Series.
3. The error message indicates that the function did not raise a `KeyError` as expected when using a list as the key.
4. The runtime values and types reveal that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as a string in all cases, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, with `list` indexers causing a specific failure.

## Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to incorrect identification of the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function, leading to inconsistent handling of list-like indexers. This inconsistency results in the function not raising a `KeyError` as expected.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined for list-like objects. This would involve handling list-like indexers in a consistent manner to align with the expected behavior specified in the failing test. Additionally, addressing the specific case for lists should resolve the issue.

## Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of `pandas` package:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame/Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        key = [key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring correct handling of list-like indexers and ensuring the proper inference of the `key_type`, this corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior for indexers.
