### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle various types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The failing test is testing the behavior when using a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or Series as the key to index the Series.
3. The bug seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior when passing a list-like object as the key.
4. The error message indicates a `KeyError`, which means the key is not found in the index.
5. In all cases analyzed, the `key_type` variable is determined as `'string'`, which is incorrect and leads to the bug.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the key type is incorrectly identified as `'string'` in all cases, which results in the wrong behavior in handling the key for indexing. This incorrect identification leads to the `KeyError` when trying to access the key from the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify the type of the key passed for indexing the Series. Then, based on the key type, we need to handle the indexing operation accordingly to avoid the `KeyError`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class that should address the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        elif is_list_like(key):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == 'string':
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By correctly identifying the key type and handling the indexing operation based on the type, the corrected function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
