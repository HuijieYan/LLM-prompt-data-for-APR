The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. Specifically, when using a list as the indexer, it raises a `KeyError`, while other indexers like ndarray or Index do not. This behavior contradicts other parts of the codebase and causes dissatisfaction among users, as discussed in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently. This can be achieved by modifying the `_get_with` function to treat list-like indexers in the same way as other indexers like ndarray or Index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as above, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue. This change should make the function behave correctly and pass the failing tests.
