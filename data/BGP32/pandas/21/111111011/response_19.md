## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys to retrieve values from a Series object. However, the issue arises when a list-like key is passed, causing a KeyError to be raised inconsistently compared to other types of keys. The failing test cases provide input values and types that expose the bug, showing that the key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` instead of being recognized as a list-like object.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle list-like keys, leading to incorrect key type inference and subsequently triggering a KeyError when attempting to access the key from the Series object.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to correctly handle list-like keys and avoid triggering a KeyError when indexing with a list. We need to adjust the logic to properly identify list-like keys and process them accordingly.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the logic to correctly handle list-like keys and avoid raising a KeyError, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and address the issue reported on GitHub.
