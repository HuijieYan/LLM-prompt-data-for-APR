### Error Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is failing to handle the case when a list indexer is used, resulting in a `KeyError`. The function is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, etc., but it fails to correctly process a list indexer.

#### Error Locations:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` should be removed or modified to properly handle list indexers.
2. The handling of list indexers needs to be adjusted to align with the behavior of other indexers.

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the function `_get_with` is not correctly handling the case when a list indexer is passed. When processing list indexers, the current implementation leads to a `KeyError` due to incorrect treatment of the indexer as a non-list-like object.

#### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers. We should adjust the conditions and processing steps to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers and that the `KeyError` is avoided.

### Corrected Version:

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version above, we have added proper handling for list indexers within the `_get_with` function. This update aims to resolve the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests.
