### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test is expecting an error message indicating that none of the specified index values are present in the Series.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the indexing is handled for different types of input keys.
4. The key_type is incorrectly inferred as "string", which leads to the wrong execution path causing the test to fail.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly inferring the key_type as "string" when handling certain types of input keys, which leads to incorrect behavior during indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the key_type inference is correct for different types of input keys.
2. Align the indexing logic based on the key_type and handle the case where the specified index values are not present in the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")

    return self.loc[key]
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a check to handle scalar input keys that are not present in the Series index.
2. If the key is scalar and not present in the index, raise a KeyError.
3. This change ensures consistent behavior for different types of input keys.

By making these corrections, the function should now handle the given test cases correctly and pass the failing test.
