### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of input `key` such as `slice`, `DataFrame`, `tuple`, and others.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to pass a `key` of type `list` to the `ser[key]` operation, triggering a `KeyError`.
3. The buggy function fails to handle a key of type `list` correctly, resulting in an error.

### Bug Description:
The bug occurs because when the input `key` is of type `list`, the function tries to extract `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. This operation returns `integer` as the inferred type for a key that is a list of strings, causing the subsequent logic to treat it as an integer indexer, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to identify when the input `key` is a `list` and handle it appropriately to avoid the `KeyError`. We should make sure that a key of type `list` is treated correctly as a label-based indexer. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = "list"  # Mark key type as 'list' for correct handling
        
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Update the condition to correctly handle key as list type
    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "list":
        # Check for list type key and perform label-based indexing
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the check for `list` type keys and treating them as label-based indexers, the corrected function should now handle the `list` input correctly and pass the failing test.
