## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of `key` inputs, such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and non-list-like elements.
2. The issue arises in the case when `key` is a list-like object, such as a pandas Series, but is being converted to a list directly in the function. This incorrect handling results in a KeyError when attempting to access the element from the Series.
3. The failing test is expecting an IndexError due to mismatched values in the index, highlighting the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers, especially for list-like objects.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle list-like objects differently and adapt the function `_get_with` to properly handle these cases to avoid the KeyError.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_list = list(key)  # Convert key to list if not already in list format

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = pd.Index(key)  # Create an Index from key list
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_list, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list-like objects, such as a pandas Series, are properly converted to a list before any operations are performed on the input `key`. This modification addresses the issue with KeyError during the indexing operation and aligns the behavior for different types of indexers.
