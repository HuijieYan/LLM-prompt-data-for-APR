## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug occurs when the buggy function `_get_with` encounters an input key that is an iterable or array-like object. The function currently handles different types of keys in different ways, leading to inconsistent behavior and causing the failing test to raise a `KeyError`. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function treats all array-like keys consistently, leading to a uniform behavior and resolving the failing test case.

## The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Check if the key is an ABCDataFrame
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    # Convert non-list-like keys to loc indexing
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Convert key to a list to handle different types uniformly
    key = list(key)
    
    # Infer the type of the key
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle various types of keys consistently
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all array-like keys are converted to a list and then treated uniformly to handle different types consistently. This should resolve the issue and make the function behave consistently for different key types.
