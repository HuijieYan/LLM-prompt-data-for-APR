## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used to retrieve values from a Series object based on different types of keys, such as slices, tuples, and lists.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior when trying to retrieve values using different types of keys, such as lists, arrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. The bug occurs when the input key is a list and the function encounters an `Index` type check that does not handle the list input correctly, leading to a KeyError.
4. The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of different types of key inputs in the `_get_with` function.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the handling of list inputs is consistent with other types of key inputs. Specifically, we need to address the case where the key is a list to avoid the KeyError when trying to return values based on the list key.

## Solution
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if len(key) == 1:
            return self.loc[key[0]]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list keys are correctly handled without causing a KeyError. It also ensures consistency in handling list inputs along with other key types.
