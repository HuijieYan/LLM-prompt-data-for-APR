## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses different types of key inputs like list, ndarray, Index, and Series and expects consistent behavior from the Series when trying to access elements that don't exist in the index.
- The error occurs specifically when using a list as the key input, causing a KeyError due to inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of a list-like key input. The function does not correctly process a list-like key input, leading to a KeyError when accessing elements that do not exist in the Series index.

## Cause:
The buggy function `_get_with(key)` does not handle list-like key inputs properly, which causes inconsistent behavior in indexing a Series. When a key that is a list is passed, it results in a KeyError because the function does not treat lists like other types of indexers.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key inputs in a consistent manner, similar to how other types of indexers are handled. Specifically, we need to ensure that attempting to access elements not present in the index does not raise a KeyError when using a list as the key.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if the key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # raise a KeyError if the key doesn't match any index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case when key is a list or other list-like objects
    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the key is not list-like and raise a KeyError if the key does not match any index. This ensures consistent behavior when accessing elements not present in the Series index, regardless of the key type used.
