## Analysis
1. The provided buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing Series.
2. The bug is likely related to how the function handles a key input that is a list-like object, which is causing an issue when trying to access an invalid key in the Series.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is expecting a KeyError to be raised when attempting to access a non-existent key in the Series. The test case uses different types of key representations (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and expects consistent behavior in each case.
4. The expected input/output values for each failing test case have been outlined, highlighting the key type and values, as well as the behavior expected before returning from the buggy function.
5. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior of Series indexing with different types of key representations, particularly focusing on the case of using a list as an index and the KeyError that is raised.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like object is passed as a key, the function does not properly handle the case where the key does not exist in the Series index. This results in no KeyError being raised, leading to the failing test.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be adjusted to ensure that when a list-like key is provided and the key does not exist in the Series index, a KeyError is raised consistently. This will align the behavior of different key representations (list, ndarray, Index, Series) with the expected outcome.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    try:
        key_list = list(key)
    except TypeError:
        key_list = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_list, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key_list]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key_list]

    if isinstance(key_list, Index):
        key_type = key_list.inferred_type

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key_list]

    return self.reindex(key_list)
```

By implementing the above corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the issue with inconsistent handling of list-like keys in the Series indexing operation should be resolved. This updated function should now raise a KeyError consistently when trying to access a key that does not exist in the Series index.
