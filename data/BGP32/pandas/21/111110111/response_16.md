After analyzing the buggy function, related class, and failing test cases, it seems that the bug is caused by the incorrect handling of indexers when they are of type list in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas.

The issue arises when the function encounters a key that is a list-like index. This list-like index should be handled consistently with other array-like indexers. However, the current implementation does not handle list-likes correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access such an index.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexes are treated in a consistent manner with other array-like indexes. We can achieve this by modifying the code to correctly handle list-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexes are converted to lists before further processing. This modification should allow the function to handle list-like indexes consistently with other array-like indexes and resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.

After applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexes correctly and pass the failing test cases provided.
