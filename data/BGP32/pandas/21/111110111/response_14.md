## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of indexers and return the appropriate value from the `Series` object. However, in the failing test case, when the key is passed as a list, the function does not handle it properly and raises a `KeyError` instead of returning the expected value.

## Bugs Identified
1. The buggy function does not properly handle the case when the key is a list.
2. The `KeyError` is raised instead of returning the expected value.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the discrepancy in how different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function. When the key is passed as a list, the function incorrectly treats it as an invalid index value, resulting in a `KeyError` being raised.

## Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list type indexers. We should ensure that when the key is a list, the function correctly interprets it as a valid index and returns the expected value instead of raising a `KeyError`.

## Updated Corrected Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key = np.asarray(key)
            
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

## Summary
The bug in the `_get_with` function has been identified and addressed in the corrected version provided above. The function now handles list type indexers correctly and returns the expected value without raising a `KeyError`. This fix will enable the function to pass the failing test cases and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
