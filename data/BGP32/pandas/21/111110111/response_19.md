### Fixing the bug

#### Understanding the issue:
The bug occurs when trying to index a Series using a list-like object that contains no matching values from the Series index. The function `_get_with` is not correctly handling the case when the key is a list or an ndarray with no matches in the Series index.

#### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle the case when the key is a list or an ndarray with no matching values in the Series index. We can catch this scenario and raise a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the values in the key are present in the Series index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should handle the case of indexing with a list or ndarray containing no matching values from the Series index by raising a `KeyError` with an appropriate message.

This solution aligns with the proposed fix strategy and addresses the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list-like objects.
