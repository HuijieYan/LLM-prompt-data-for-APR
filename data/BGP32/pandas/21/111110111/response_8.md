## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with different data types as keys and expects a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.
3. The error occurs when using a `list` as the key input, which triggers the last `elif` block in the `_get_with` function, leading to an incorrect return value.
4. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index for all input data types.

## Proposed Fix
1. Modify the last `elif` block in the `_get_with` function to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index for all data types.
2. Update the logic in the function to handle different key types consistently.

## Corrected Function
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        # Raise KeyError if key not found in the index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]
```

By making these changes, the function will handle all types of keys consistently and raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.
