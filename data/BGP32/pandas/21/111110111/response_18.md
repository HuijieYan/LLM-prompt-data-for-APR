After analyzing the buggy function, related test cases, input/output values, and the GitHub issue, we can see that the issue arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled by the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. The function fails to handle a list-like `key` properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access a value that does not exist in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like `key` indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function, similar to how other indexers are handled. We can achieve this by explicitly checking for list-like indexers and treating them appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Rest of the code stays the same
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking if `key` is list-like and using `loc` to access the value, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This correction should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test cases and align the behavior of different types of indexers as requested in the GitHub issue.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list-like indexers when accessing values in a Series.
