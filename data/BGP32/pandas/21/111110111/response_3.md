## An analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, test code, and the GitHub issue

1. **Buggy Function**: The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of pandas is intended to handle different types of indexing keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and other objects. However, it fails to properly handle a list-like key when attempting to access items from the Series.

2. **Related Functions**:
    - `_slice`: Slices the series based on the input slice object.
    - `_get_values_tuple`: Handles a tuple key.
    - `reindex`: Reindexes the Series based on the input index.

3. **Failing Test**: The failing test aims to check the behavior of accessing a Series with a list-like key (`box` being a list, ndarray, Index, or Series object) that does not match any existing index values. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised, as the key does not exist in the Series index.

4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue discusses the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically focusing on the difference in behavior when indexing with a list compared to other array-like objects. The issue proposes aligning the behavior with list indexers to have a consistent approach.

## Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function fails to correctly handle a list-like key, leading to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other indexer types. The function incorrectly processes a list key by passing it to the `reindex` method rather than raising a `KeyError` when the key does not match any existing index values. This results in a failure to retrieve the expected values from the Series, consequently causing the test to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to check if the key is list-like and raise a `KeyError` if the key does not match any existing index values in the Series. This adjustment will align the behavior with other array-like indexers and ensure consistency.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the updated code snippet above, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys correctly by raising a `KeyError` if the key does not correspond to any existing index values in the Series. This adjustment aligns the behavior with the expected outcome and resolves the bug reported in the failing test case.
