## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of the pandas library aims to index a Series object with the provided key.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` calls the `_get_with(key)` function with different types of keys such as a list, an array, an Index, and a Series, but it fails when the key is a list.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of input keys, leading to incorrect behavior when the key is a list.
4. The bug is causing a `KeyError` as the function is unable to find a match in the index for the provided key.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with(key)` function when the key is a list. Unlike other types of keys, the function fails to handle list keys correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the key values from the Series. This issue is due to inconsistent behavior in how different key types are processed within the function.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of keys are handled consistently within the `_get_with(key)` function. Specifically, when the key is a list, it should be processed correctly to avoid the `KeyError`. We can update the conditional statements in the function to handle all types of keys uniformly.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "bool":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with(key)` function to handle all types of keys consistently, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and provide the expected output for different key types.
