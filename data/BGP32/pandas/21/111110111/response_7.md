## Identified issues:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object properly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised incorrectly.
2. The expected behavior for list indexers is different from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistency in the results.

## Cause of the bug:
The buggy function `_get_with` does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to a `KeyError` being raised when accessing a `Series` with a list key. This behavior is inconsistent with other array-like indexers. The bug arises from not properly distinguishing between different types of indexers when processing the key parameter.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys properly. We should differentiate between the different types of indexers (list, array, index) and ensure consistent behavior for each type. By making the necessary adjustments based on the type of the key parameter, we can achieve consistent and expected behavior.

## Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

## Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles list-like keys, checks for the presence of keys in the index, and returns the desired behavior. By distinguishing between different types of indexers and implementing appropriate handling logic, the function now aligns with the expected behavior for accessing a `Series` with various types of keys. This correction resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue and ensures consistent behavior across different indexers.
