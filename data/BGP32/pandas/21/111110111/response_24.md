## Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is used for indexing operation. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` tests the behavior of indexing a `Series` with different types of indexers like lists, ndarrays, `Index` objects, and `Series` objects. The failing test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to index with an indexer that has no matches in the `Series`.

The failing test fails specifically when using a list indexer (`list(key)`) on a `Series` object, and this behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers. The `KeyError` message indicates that none of the elements of the index provided by the list indexer are found in the actual `Series` index.

## Identifying the bug

The bug lies in the condition that handles the case when `key` is not list-like. The current implementation tries to convert `key` into a list if it's not list-like, but this conversion approach is causing the issue when the indexer is a pandas `Series` object converted to a list. This conversion does not yield the expected behavior and results in a `KeyError` when trying to index the `Series`.

## Bug fix strategy

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when `key` is a pandas `Series` object separately from general list and ndarray indexers. We need to avoid converting the `Series` object to a list, as it is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCIndex, ABCSeries)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = [key]
    elif isinstance(key, list) and not all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
        key = [k for k in key if isinstance(k, str)]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, we handle the case when `key` is a pandas `Series` object appropriately by directly using `self.loc[key]` and avoid unnecessary list conversion. This should resolve the issue where using a list indexer on a `Series` object leads to a `KeyError`.
