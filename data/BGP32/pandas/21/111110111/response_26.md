## Analyzing the buggy function

1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is within the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function receives a `key` parameter, which is used to determine which values to retrieve from the series.
3. Within the function, there are conditional checks based on the type of the `key` parameter to handle different cases, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, and Index objects.
4. The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is a list-like object.

## Identifying potential error locations
The bug is likely related to how the function handles list-like objects in the `key` parameter and the usage of `loc` for getting values from the series.

## Cause of the bug
When the `key` parameter is a list, the function tries to directly access the values using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError if the values in the list do not exist in the index of the series. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled (such as slices or numpy arrays), which would not raise an error in this scenario.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we can modify the behavior for list-like objects. Instead of using `self.loc[key]`, we can reindex the series with the `key` parameter. This would ensure consistency with other indexers and avoid raising KeyError when the values in the list are not present in the series index.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not " "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By reindexing with the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object, we ensure that the function behaves consistently across different types of indexers and does not raise a KeyError in the case where values in the list are not present in the series index.
