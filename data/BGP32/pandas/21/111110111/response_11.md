To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers. The current implementation raises a `KeyError` when indexing with a list, while it should return `NaN` as it does for other array-like indexers.

The cause of the bug lies in the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` which incorrectly handles list-like objects. This condition should be removed and the logic in the subsequent block should be adjusted to handle list indexers appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not " "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Changed the condition to handle list-like objects appropriately
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior when indexing with list-like objects, consistent with other array-like indexers.
