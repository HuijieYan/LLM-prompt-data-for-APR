## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is a method of the `Series` class that handles different types of `key` inputs to retrieve values. 
   
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access an index that does not exist in the series. The test is designed to check the behavior for different `key` types including list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series.

3. The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is of type `Index` (from pandas) or a subclass, leading to incorrect handling and absence of expected exception.

4. The function incorrectly tries to handle the case when `key` is of type `Index`, leading to the issue. Instead, it should treat `key` of type `Index` in a similar way to other array-like indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section in the `buggy function` that handles the case for `Index` type `key`. We should avoid the unnecessary branching and treat `key` of type `Index` similar to other array-like indexers.

## Bug-free code
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
            key = list(key)
    
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making the suggested changes, the function will correctly handle different key types including `Index`, ensuring that the expected `KeyError` is raised when trying to access an index that does not exist in the series.
