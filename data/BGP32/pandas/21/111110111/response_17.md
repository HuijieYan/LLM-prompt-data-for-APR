## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys for indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Index objects.
2. The function processes the input key differently based on its type, eventually determining the key type ('integer' or 'string'). However, there is inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to verify the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that has no matches in the index. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised, but currently, the buggy function does not raise this error when a list-like key is used.
4. The inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types leads to the failing test case.
5. The proposed fix should update the `_get_with` function to ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when a list-like key does not have any matches in the index, consistent with how other types are handled.

## Proposed Fix
To address the bug and make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys appropriately and raise a `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(self.index.isin(key)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check for `if not any(self.index.isin(key))`, the function now ensures that a `KeyError` is raised when a list-like key does not have any matches in the index, resolving the inconsistency and passing the failing test cases.
