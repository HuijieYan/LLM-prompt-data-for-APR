After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue arises when passing a list as an indexer to a Series object. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, but it fails when receiving a list indexer.

The key issue is that the function incorrectly processes list-like indexers and fails to handle them as expected, leading to a KeyError in the failing test cases. The function should be modified to correctly handle list indexers to align with the behavior for other indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are processed correctly and that the appropriate series elements are returned without raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, list-like indexers are first processed by converting them to a list if needed before calling `loc` on the Series object. This modification ensures that list indexers are handled correctly without raising a KeyError.

By implementing this fix, the function should now correctly handle different types of indexers and pass the failing test cases.
