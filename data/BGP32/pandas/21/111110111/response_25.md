To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. The issue arises when trying to access a Series element using a list indexer, resulting in a KeyError.

To resolve this issue, we can update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers. We can modify the section of the code where lists are being processed to ensure that it behaves consistently with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert non-array indexers to lists
    key_as_list = key if is_list_like(key) else [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle all types of list indexers consistently
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat as positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key_as_list]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key_as_list]

    return self.reindex(key_as_list)
```

In this corrected version, we convert non-array indexers to lists, ensuring that all types of indexers are treated consistently before further processing. This adjustment should address the issue identified in the failing test and provide a more uniform behavior when accessing Series elements with different types of indexers.
