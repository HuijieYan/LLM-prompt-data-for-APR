### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of indexing keys, such as slices, pandas DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when indexing a Series with a key that doesn't match any index values.
3. The error occurs when indexing a Series with a key that is a list-like object, such as an array, Index, or Series. The error message indicates that the KeyError is not raised as expected.
4. The expected behavior is that a KeyError should be raised when trying to access an index value that doesn't exist in the Series.
5. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling list-like indexing keys and not raising the KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function failing to properly handle list-like indexing keys and not raising a KeyError when the key is not found in the index. This inconsistency in error handling causes the test to fail.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a KeyError is raised when trying to access an index value that doesn't exist in the Series. This can be achieved by updating the logic for list-like indexing keys to check if the key is in the index before attempting to access it. If the key is not found, a KeyError should be raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not self.index.isin(key).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly check if the key exists in the Series index before attempting to access it. If the key is not found, it will raise a KeyError as expected.
