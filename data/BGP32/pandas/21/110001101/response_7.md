### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic that determines the `key_type`. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` in all provided cases, which leads to incorrect processing of the key.

In the provided cases:
- The `key` values are all related to accessing the Series with a specific key value (e.g., 'C').
- The `key_type` is erroneously inferred as `'string'` when it should be `'object'` or another type that accurately represents the key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic responsible for inferring the `key_type` within the `_get_with` function. By accurately determining the correct type of the key, we can ensure that the Series is accessed correctly based on the input key.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
                
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
``` 

### Summary
The corrected `_get_with` function now accurately determines the `key_type` based on the input key, ensuring proper access to the Series data. This fix addresses the bug by correctly inferring the key type in various scenarios, thus allowing the function to operate as expected.
