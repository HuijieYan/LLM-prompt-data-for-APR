### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle different types of input keys for indexing. However, there are some issues in the function that cause it to return incorrect results and raise TypeErrors in certain cases.

1. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the function incorrectly identifies the type of the key as `'string'` when it should be identifying it as a valid index type.
2. In Case 4, even though the key is a Series object, the function treats it as a scalar which results in an incorrect return value.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not have proper checks and handling for different types of input keys. This leads to incorrect identification of key types and inappropriate indexing operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Add proper checks for different key types like list, ndarray, Index, Series, etc.
2. Make sure to treat each type of key appropriately for indexing operations.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list) and all(is_integer(x) for x in key):
            return self.iloc[key]
    
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function includes appropriate handling for different types of input keys, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.
