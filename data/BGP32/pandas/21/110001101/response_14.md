## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type inference. The function fails to properly categorize the type of the key, resulting in returning incorrect results.

1. In Case 1, the key is a list `['C']`, which is correctly identified as a list-like object. However, the function incorrectly infers the key as `'string'`.
   
2. In Case 2, the key is an ndarray `array(['C'], dtype=object)`, which should also be recognized as a list-like object, but again, the function incorrectly infers the key as `'string'`.

3. In Case 3, the key is an `Index` object, but the inferred type is still incorrectly set as `'string'`.
   
4. In Case 4, the key is a Series object `0    C dtype: object`, which is also a valid list-like input. However, the inferred key type remains incorrect.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred for all valid list-like input types. We can update the code to properly determine the type of the key, allowing the function to return the expected results.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for possible list-like input types
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        key = key.values
        
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle duplicate indexing
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the correct type inference logic and ensuring that all valid list-like inputs are handled appropriately, the corrected `_get_with` function should now return the expected results for all cases described.
