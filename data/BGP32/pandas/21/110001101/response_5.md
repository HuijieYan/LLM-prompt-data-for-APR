## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the improper handling of the `key` parameter. In the provided function, there are multiple conditional blocks checking the type of `key` and performing different actions based on the type. However, the handling of `key` as an `Index` object is incorrect. The code checks whether `key` is an instance of `Index`, but this is not accurate since `key` may consist of values from the `Index` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional block handling the case when `key` is an instance of `Index`. Instead of directly trying to extract the `inferred_type` from `key`, we should extract the values from the `Index` object `key` and perform necessary operations based on those values.

## Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_instance(key, Index):
        # Extracting values from Index object
        key = key.values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the case where `key` is an instance of `Index` and extract the values from it for further processing.
