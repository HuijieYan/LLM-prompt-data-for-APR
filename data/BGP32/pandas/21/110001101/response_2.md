### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. In the provided function, there is a check for the `key_type` to determine the type of the key passed as an input. However, the bug lies in the condition checks for different types of `key`.

In the provided function, the condition for checking if `key` is an instance of `list` is done using `isinstance(key, list)`. The issue is that if the `key` passed is an instance of `Index`, it will still return `False` for the `isinstance(key, list)` check because an instance of `Index` is not exactly an instance of `list`.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checks to properly handle the case where `key` is passed as an instance of `Index`. Additionally, we need to check for `Index` type separately to handle all possible scenarios accurately.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
            key = [key]
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This version fixes the bug by correctly checking for `Index` type and handling it separately. Now, the function should behave as expected for all input scenarios.
