## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is designed to handle different types of input `key` parameters and return the appropriate values based on the type of `key`. However, there are issues with the logic in the function:

1. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases, which is incorrect. It fails to correctly infer the type of the input `key`.

2. The handling of different types of `key` variables is not consistent and may result in incorrect behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the input `key` variable and then handles each type appropriately. Additionally, we need to address the inconsistent handling of different types of `key` variables.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- We use `ensure_index` to standardize the `key` input regardless of its initial form.
- We correctly infer the `key_type` based on the `key` variable.
- We ensure consistent handling of different types of `key` variables to prevent incorrect behavior.

This corrected version should now satisfy all the expected input/output values mentioned in the bug report.
