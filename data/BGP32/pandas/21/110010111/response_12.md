### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The function contains several conditional blocks to handle input keys of different types. However, the bug is related to the handling of a specific type of key (list-like) causing a `KeyError` in the failing test cases.

The failing test cases are focused on checking the behavior of indexing a Series object with different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The expected behavior is consistent across these types of keys, and the bug in the `_get_with` function is causing the inconsistency, leading to the `KeyError` not being raised as expected.

### Cause of the bug

The bug arises when the input key is list-like (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`). The function currently returns unexpected results or raises errors instead of correctly handling the list-like key.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug:
1. Identify the block of code responsible for handling list-like keys.
2. Modify this block to correctly handle list-like keys by finding the index values in the Series based on the list-like key items. Ensure that the correct behavior is maintained across different list-like key types.
3. Ensure that when indexing with list-like keys, the correct values are retrieved from the Series object.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should address the bug and ensure that the behavior is consistent when indexing a Series object with list-like keys. It should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output values for the given input keys.
