### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class contains conditional statements to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other types like lists, arrays, and Index objects.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing when using a list-like key for indexing.
3. The expected behavior is that when indexing with a list or ndarray key, the function should return `NaN` for missing values, similar to how it behaves with other types of indexers.
4. The bug appears to be related to the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers to avoid the `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list-like key is used, the function raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` for missing values. This inconsistency is the cause of the failing test case reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a consistent manner, ensuring that missing values are handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when indexing with a list-like key, missing values will be handled correctly. This change aligns the behavior with the expected results and resolves the inconsistency identified in the failing test cases.
