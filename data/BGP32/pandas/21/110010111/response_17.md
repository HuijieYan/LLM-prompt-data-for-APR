### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The function checks the type of the key and based on that type, it returns a subset of the Series data.
3. The function contains conditionals for different key types like `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, and others.
4. The failing test cases are related to passing a key of type `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` to the Series object, resulting in a `KeyError`.
5. The expected behavior is to handle these different types of keys correctly and not raise a `KeyError`.
6. The GitHub issue highlights inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers when used with a Series object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of certain key types (list, np.array, Index, and Series) within the `_get_with` function. The function currently does not properly handle these key types, leading to a `KeyError` during indexing.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Modify the code block where different key types are processed to ensure that keys of types list, np.array, Index, and Series are handled correctly.
2. The function should be updated to properly manage these key types to prevent the `KeyError` exceptions.

### Updated Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = [key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the different types of keys correctly and resolve the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing test cases.
