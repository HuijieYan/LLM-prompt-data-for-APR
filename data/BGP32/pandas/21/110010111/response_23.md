### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in pandas.
2. The function is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc.
3. The error message indicates a failure when trying to index a Series with a key that is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
4. The expected behavior is that indexing with any of these types should raise a `KeyError` if the values in the key are not present in the index.
5. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the different types of keys, especially when checking if the key exists in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the function is related to how different types of keys are being handled. When a list key is provided, the function attempts to handle it differently than other types of keys, which leads to incorrect behavior and the `KeyError` not being raised when expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats all types of keys consistently, especially regarding checking for the existence of values in the index. We should aim to have a unified approach for handling indexers to avoid the current inconsistency in behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            f"Indexing a Series with {type(key).__name__} is not supported"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, we have removed the specific handling for lists and ensured that all types of keys are converted to an index using `ensure_index`. This should provide consistent behavior for different types of keys and address the issue of the `KeyError` not being raised when expected.
