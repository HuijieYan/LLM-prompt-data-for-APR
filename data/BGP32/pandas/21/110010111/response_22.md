### Analysis:
1. The `__getitem__` method in the `Series` class is failing to handle the case where the indexer `key` is a list-like object properly. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised incorrectly.
2. The `is_list_like` method is used to identify list-like objects, but the process of converting the `key` to a list is not consistent throughout the function.
3. The primary cause of the bug is the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers like lists, arrays, and indexes. This inconsistency leads to the incorrect behavior when indexing with a list.
4. To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like objects consistently and accurately determine the `key_type` to decide how to index the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the logic to handle list-like objects in a consistent manner throughout the function.
2. Ensure that the `key_type` is properly determined based on the type of the `key` to make the decision between `loc` and `iloc` indexing.
3. Update the logic to handle cases where `key` is an Index type appropriately.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected implementation, the function should handle all types of indexers consistently and avoid raising `KeyError` incorrectly in tests involving list-like objects.
