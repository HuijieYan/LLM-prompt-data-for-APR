### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that the indexing behavior differs when using a list as the key compared to other data structures like ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The expected behavior is for all cases to behave consistently, returning NaN when there are no matching values in the index.
4. The bug is likely due to the specific handling of lists in the function `_get_with`.
5. The bug can be fixed by updating the logic for handling list indexers to align with the behavior for other indexers.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to inconsistencies. When a list indexer is used, the function raises a KeyError even if there are no matching values in the index, while it correctly returns NaN for other indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should be updated to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. Specifically, it should return NaN when there are no matching values in the index for list indexers.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not supported")
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as shown above, the bug related to inconsistent behavior with list indexers should be resolved, and the function should now pass the failing test cases while maintaining consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
