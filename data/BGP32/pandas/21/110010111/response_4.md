### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is getting a key input and based on its type, it performs different operations like slicing, raising an error if the key is a DataFrame, getting values using a tuple, etc.
2. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when indexing the Series `ser` with a key that does not match any index values. The test is being performed for different key types like list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different key types compared to indexing behavior and error raising inconsistencies.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different key types.
5. To fix the bug, the function should handle different key types consistently and raise a KeyError when the key does not match any index values.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like key types correctly and leads to inconsistent behavior based on the key type when finding no match in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all key types when indexing the Series.
2. Add a check to raise a `KeyError` when the key does not match any index values, regardless of the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is in the index
    if not any(key == idx for idx in self.index):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function will consistently raise a `KeyError` when the key does not match any index values, regardless of the key type.
