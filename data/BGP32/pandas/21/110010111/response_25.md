### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input key values for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of the key and then performs different operations based on the key type.
2. The error occurs when the key is a list-like object. The current implementation handles list-like keys differently than other types causing inconsistency in behavior.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that when indexing with a list of values, the function throws a KeyError because it fails to find the values in the index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when indexing with different types of keys.
5. By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys similarly to other types, we can resolve the inconsistency issue.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column or Index object"
        )
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the code to treat list-like keys in a similar manner to other types of keys, we ensure a consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This fix addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
