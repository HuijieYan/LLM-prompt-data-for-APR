### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.) and return the corresponding indexed values from the Series.
2. The bug is likely to be related to how the function handles the key parameter, specifically when it is of type `Index` or `list`.
3. The failing test expects a KeyError to be raised when indexing with a list that has no matches in the Series index, but the current implementation does not raise the KeyError in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when indexing with a list and no matches are found in the index, a KeyError is correctly raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of list indexers compared to other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When indexing with a list, the function should raise a KeyError if none of the elements in the list match the Series index. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly, leading to the failing test.

### Proposed Fix:
We need to modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case when indexing with a list and no matches are found in the Series index. Specifically, we need to check if the list key contains elements that are not present in the Series index and raise a KeyError if that is the case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        # If any element in the list key is not in the Series index, raise a KeyError
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to ensure that all elements in the list key are present in the Series index, we can fix the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
