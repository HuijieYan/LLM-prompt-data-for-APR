### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of input `key` for indexing a `Series`.
2. The error message indicates that when passing a list as `key`, the function does not handle it properly and raises a `KeyError`.
3. The expected behavior is to handle all types of input consistently for indexing without raising errors.
4. The bug is related to how different types of `key` inputs are processed and converted before indexing the `Series`.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug occurs when a list is passed as `key` to the `ser[key]` operation.
2. If the passed `key` is a list, the function currently attempts to convert it to a list again (line 53), which disrupts the indexing operation.
3. This incorrect handling of converting lists for indexing leads to the `KeyError` because the index does not match the converted list.
4. The function should handle lists properly to align with other indexing methods and avoid the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should check if the `key` is a list-like object and handle it appropriately without unnecessary conversions. The goal is to ensure that all types of input keys are treated consistently for indexing.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles different types of input keys for indexing a `Series`, addressing the bug identified.
