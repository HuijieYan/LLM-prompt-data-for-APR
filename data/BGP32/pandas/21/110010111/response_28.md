### Analysis:
1. The `key` parameter could have different types: `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`.
2. The buggy function `_get_with` is handling the different types of `key` in a way that is causing an inconsistency in behavior.
3. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised, but the function is not raising it for specific cases.
4. The cause of the bug is related to how the function handles different types of `key`, especially when it is a list. The if conditions may not cover all necessary cases.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all types of `key` consistently and raises a `KeyError` when needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle all types of `key` consistently.
2. Ensure that when `key` is a list, it raises a `KeyError` if any values in the list are not present in the index.
3. Make sure to maintain the behavior for other types of `key` as expected.
4. Update the function to match the expected behavior outlined in the failing test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the different types of `key` consistently, especially when `key` is a list. It should raise a `KeyError` if any values in the list are not present in the index, matching the expected behavior in the failing test.
