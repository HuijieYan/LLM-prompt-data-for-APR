### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used to handle different types of keys passed to a `Series` object for indexing. It contains branching logic to determine the type of key and handle it accordingly.
2. The error message indicates that when a `Series` object is indexed using a list key, it raises a `KeyError` because none of the items in the key are found in the index.
3. The function seems to mishandle the case when a list key is used for indexing. It tries to reindex the Series with the key instead of accessing the values directly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the list key case correctly by accessing the values directly instead of trying to reindex.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function mishandling a list key passed for indexing a `Series`. Instead of directly accessing the values corresponding to the provided keys, it attempts to reindex the `Series` with the list key, leading to a `KeyError` when none of the key values are found in the index.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for handling list keys in the `_get_with` function to directly access the values associated with the provided keys. This will prevent the `KeyError` from occurring when none of the key values are present in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_arr = np.asarray(key)
    
    if is_integer(key_arr) or is_bool(key_arr):
        return self._get_values(key_arr)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key_arr)
```

By directly accessing the values using `self._get_values(key_arr)` for integer and bool keys, and reindexing only for non-integer, non-bool keys, we ensure that the correct behavior is maintained for all types of keys, including list keys. This corrected version should resolve the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing test cases.
