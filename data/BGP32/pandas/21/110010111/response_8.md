### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class:** The `_get_with` function is a method of the `Series` class in pandas. It handles different types of indexing (slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc.) within a pandas Series object.
   
2. **Potential error locations:** The issue seems to be with how the function handles `list` type indexers compared to other types like arrays, indices, and Series.

3. **Cause of the bug:**
   - The bug occurs when the input `key` is of type `list`. In this case, the function does not handle the `list` type properly and leads to a `KeyError`.
   - The error message indicates that for a list indexer, none of the items in the list are found in the index. This discrepancy in behavior is mentioned in the GitHub issue as well.

4. **Strategy for fixing the bug:**
   - To fix the bug, we need to handle `list` indexers in a similar manner to how other types (array-like, Index, Series) are handled.
   - The handling of `list` indexers should be consistent with other types to avoid the `KeyError` raised in this case.

5. **Corrected version of the function:**
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert to list to handle all list-like objects

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making `key` a list and handling list indexers in a similar way to other array-like objects, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior for all types of indexers.
