### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used in the `Series` class to handle different types of indexers (`key`) while indexing the series. 
2. The function checks the type of the `key` parameter and applies different logic based on the type.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is a KeyError when trying to index the series using a list key. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError.
4. The function needs to correctly handle list-like keys to avoid the KeyError and align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key for indexing. The function is not able to handle list keys correctly, leading to a KeyError which is unexpected behavior. This is a known issue highlighted in the GitHub issue description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the function logic to correctly handle list-like keys for indexing within the Series.
2. Ensure that the key error is raised when none of the items in the key are present in the series index.
3. Align the behavior with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `ensure_index` on the key and making necessary adjustments, the corrected function now handles list-like keys appropriately, avoiding the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub request.
