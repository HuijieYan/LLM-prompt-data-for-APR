### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing. However, the bug lies in how it processes a list-like key, leading to KeyError in specific cases.
2. The error messages from the failing test indicate that the issue arises when using different types of indexers like lists, arrays, and indexes.
3. The function fails to handle list-like keys appropriately, leading to a KeyError when trying to index with a list.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly differentiate between the types of input keys and handle list-like keys the same way as other indexers like arrays or indexes.
5. By making the function treat list-like keys consistently with other indexers, the KeyErrors can be avoided.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, pd.DataFrame)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle list-like keys the same way as array-like or index-like keys, resolving the KeyError issues and making the function behavior consistent across different types of input key structures.
