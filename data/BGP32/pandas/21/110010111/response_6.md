### Identification of potential errors:

1. The `is_list_like` function is being used in the buggy function without handling the case when `key` is a list. This leads to an inconsistency in behavior when a list is passed as `key`.
2. The function is not correctly differentiating between different types of indexers, leading to incorrect handling of the input `key`.

### Cause of the bug:

The bug occurs due to the function `_get_with` not properly handling different types of indexer inputs. When a list is passed as `key`, the function does not correctly handle it, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the element from the Series.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Add a check to handle lists as input keys separately and make sure they are correctly processed.
2. Ensure proper differentiation between different types of indexers to avoid inconsistent behavior.

### Corrected version of the function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            return self._get_values(key)
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles lists as input keys, ensures the correct differentiation between different types of indexers, and should resolve the `KeyError` issue reported in the GitHub bug.
