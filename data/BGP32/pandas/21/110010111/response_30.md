### Analysis:
1. The `Series._get_with` function is intended to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The error occurs when trying to index a `Series` using a list or an array-like object that doesn't match any index values in the `Series`.
3. The error message indicates that when using a list or an array-like object as the key, it raises a `KeyError` instead of treating it similarly to the other indexers.
4. The expected behavior is to handle list-like input keys consistently with other types of indexers.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a `Series` with list-like objects compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by treating list-like input keys differently from other types of indexers, resulting in a `KeyError` instead of handling the input key appropriately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like input keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers when indexing a `Series`. This can be achieved by updating the logic within the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like input keys.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like input keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic as shown above, we ensure that list-like input keys are handled appropriately when indexing a `Series`, fixing the bug and aligning the behavior with other types of indexers.
