### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the case where the key is in the format of a list correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.
3. The function should determine the type of the key and branch into appropriate handling cases. Currently, the bug seems to occur when the key is in the form of a list.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys correctly.
5. We need to modify the function to handle list-like keys appropriately and provide the expected behavior for indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like keys properly. Instead of correctly indexing with a list-like key, the function raises a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of keys are handled.

### Proposed Fix:
We need to modify the function to handle list-like keys. Specifically, when the key is in the form of a list, the function should fall back to treating it as a positional indexer and use `self.iloc[key]`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By using `self.iloc[key]` for list-like keys, we ensure that the function correctly handles indexing with lists and provides the expected behavior.
