Based on the runtime values and types provided, the issue arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it results in a KeyError due to the mismatch in how it is processed compared to other types of indexers like arrays or indexes.

To address this issue, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a consistent way with other indexers. We can modify the conditional statements to ensure that list-like keys are correctly processed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, str):
        # Handle list-like keys
        key = list(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a specific handling for list-like keys that are not strings, ensuring they are correctly processed within the function. This modification should address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests.
