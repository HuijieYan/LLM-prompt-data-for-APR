### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. However, there are inconsistencies in how different types of key inputs are processed, leading to a KeyError in certain scenarios.

1. The function has a conditional block to handle `is_list_like(key)` where it calls `self.loc[key]`. This can cause a KeyError when the key is a list of values not present in the Series index.

2. The issue arises when using `list` key input. The function tries to reindex based on the `list` key, which can result in a KeyError if the values in the list are not present in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency, we need to revise the logic for handling `list` key inputs. Instead of trying to reindex directly with the `list` key, we should first check if all values in the `list` key are present in the Series index before performing the reindexing operation.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Check if all values are present in the Series index
        if all(val in self.index for val in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking if all values in the `list` key are present in the Series index before attempting to reindex, we can prevent the KeyError that was occurring in the failing test cases. This correction aligns the behavior with the expected indexing outcomes and addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
