### Bug analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. The bug arises when the key type is a list, which leads to an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types like np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series.

### Error location:
The bug is likely located in the block handling list-like keys. The current implementation treats list keys differently from other types, leading to an incorrect KeyError in some cases.

### Bug cause:
The bug occurs because the function logic for handling list-like keys is not aligned with other types of keys. This leads to an inconsistency in behavior, which results in the KeyError raised during indexing with a list key.

### Bug fixing strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all types of input keys in the function. This involves aligning the logic for list keys with the behavior observed for np.array, pd.Index, and pd.Series keys. By addressing the inconsistency, we can resolve the KeyError during indexing with list keys.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle all types of inputs consistently
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys to align with other input types, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to inconsistent behavior in indexing with different types of keys.
