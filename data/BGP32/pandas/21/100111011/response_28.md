The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of lists as indexers in the `key` parameter. Depending on the type of the key provided (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series), the function does not consistently handle the indexing operation, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

### Bug Explanation:
- When a list indexer (e.g., `list(['C'])`) is passed as `key`, the function tries to perform `self.loc[key]` which results in a KeyError if the elements of the list are not present in the Series index.
- In the failing test, the key is `['C']` which triggers the KeyError because 'C' is not present in the index of the Series.
- The bug causes inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) are handled consistently. We can modify the logic to check for the type of the key and perform the appropriate indexing operation to prevent the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = pd.Index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
        # Ensure that all index types are handled consistently
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the above changes, the function should now handle different types of indexers correctly and avoid the KeyError issue highlighted in the failing test cases.
