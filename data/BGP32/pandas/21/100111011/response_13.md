### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. The problem arises when using a list-like key that contains no matching values in the Series' index. This results in a `KeyError` being raised inconsistently based on the type of key (list, array, Index). The failing tests illustrate this inconsistency and issue related to indexing behavior.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of list-like keys that do not match any values in the Series' index. The function wrongly interprets the key type and does not handle the situation where no matches are found correctly. This inconsistency leads to errors when indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is causing the `KeyError` to be inconsistently raised for different key types when no matches are found in the Series' index. This inconsistency is not aligned with expected behavior and causes the failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys that do not have any matching values in the Series' index are handled consistently across different types of indexers (list, array, Index). The goal is to raise a `KeyError` in all cases when no matches are found.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or len(key) == 0:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of list-like keys with no matching values in the Series' index, raising a `KeyError` in all cases. By enforcing this consistent behavior, the bug causing the failing tests should be resolved.
