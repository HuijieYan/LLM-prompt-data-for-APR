## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle various cases of key types for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series using different key types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and expects KeyError when the key is not in the index.
3. The bug occurs when a key of type `list` is passed. In this case, the function fails to handle the key correctly and raises a KeyError even when the key is not present in the index.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent behavior of indexing when using a key of type `list`. The function incorrectly reindexes the key without checking if the key is present in the index, leading to a KeyError.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a key of type `list` is passed, the function should handle it in a way consistent with other key types (ndarray, Index, Series). Specifically, it should check if the elements of the list key are present in the index before indexing.

## Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # Handle DataFrame key
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # Handle tuple key
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like scalars
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle the case where key is a list
        if isinstance(key, list) and not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        
        # Infer key type
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By including a check for list-like keys and ensuring that all elements in the list key are present in the index, we can handle the key consistently and avoid the KeyError that was previously raised. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
