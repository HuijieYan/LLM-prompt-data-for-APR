### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case when the key is a list correctly. When the key is a list, the function is not converting it properly to be used for indexing, leading to a mismatch and ultimately raising a `KeyError`.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to test how different types of input (list, array, Index, Series) behave when used as a key to index a Series. The test expects consistent behavior, but the buggy function is not providing this consistency.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case when the key is a list. This involves converting the key appropriately for indexing operations. We should also ensure that the behavior is consistent across different key types (list, array, Index, Series) as expected by the test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert key to list if it's not already a compatible type
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making sure that list keys are properly handled and indexed, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and provide a consistent behavior for different types of keys.
