### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list type properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to index the Series. This issue is related to how the function distinguishes between different types of key input.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the section where the function handles the key that is not list-like. The function is not correctly handling the case when the key is a list, leading to the KeyError in the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not have a specific condition to handle key inputs that are of a list type. When a key is a list, it is not processed correctly which results in a KeyError when trying to perform indexing on the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to add a specific condition to handle key inputs that are list-like. We should ensure that list keys are processed correctly, similar to other types of key inputs like np.ndarray or Index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
  
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including a specific condition to handle list-like keys and ensuring they are processed correctly, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
