### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of pandas is not handling the case where a list-like key is provided correctly.
2. The failing test is trying to index a Series with a list-like key and expects a `KeyError` to be raised.
3. The error message indicates that the indexing is not behaving consistently for list, ndarray, Index, and Series inputs.
4. The runtime values show that the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` for all cases.
5. This bug is reported in GitHub issue #5880, where the inconsistency in behavior for different indexers is highlighted.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys consistently by raising a `KeyError` when none of the items in the key are found in the Series index.
2. Improve the identification of `key_type` based on the type of indexer provided.
3. Ensure that the behavior is consistent for list, ndarray, Index, and Series inputs.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now behave consistently for list, ndarray, Index, and Series inputs as expected by the failing test.
