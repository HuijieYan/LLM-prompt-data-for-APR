### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to arise from how different types of indexers are processed, especially when the key is a list. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is attempting to index a Series using a key that does not exist in the Series. The error message suggests that the KeyError is not being raised as expected.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when a key indexer of type list is passed to the Series indexing. The function does not handle list indexers properly, resulting in an incorrect behavior and failing tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is passed, the function should raise a KeyError if none of the elements in the list are in the Series index. We need to ensure consistency in error handling for different types of indexers.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle list indexers, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of keys.
