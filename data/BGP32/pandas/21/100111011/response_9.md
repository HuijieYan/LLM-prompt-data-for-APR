The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, particularly when using a list indexer causing a KeyError. The issue is related to the behavior difference between list indexers and other array-like indexers.

The root cause of the bug can be traced to the specific handling of list indexers within the function. When a list-like key is passed, the function tries to reindex the Series with that key, which leads to a KeyError if the key elements are not present in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like key is provided, the function handles it correctly, similar to how other array-like indexers are handled. We can modify the function to prevent KeyError by checking if the key elements are present in the index before reindexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above correction, the function now checks if all elements in the list key are present in the index before attempting to reindex. This aligns the behavior of list indexers with other array-like indexers in handling missing elements, resolving the KeyError issue.

By incorporating this change, the corrected function should pass the failing tests and address the GitHub issue related to inconsistent behavior between list and array-like indexers.
