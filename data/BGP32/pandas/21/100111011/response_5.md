The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from how it handles the key parameter when it is passed as a list-like input. The function incorrectly treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

The root cause of the bug lies in the conditional statements in the `_get_with` function that do not properly handle list-like input. Specifically, when the key is a list, the function fails to retrieve the values from the Series leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list-like input across different types of indexers. We should modify the code to treat list-like input the same way as other types, such as arrays or Index objects, to maintain a consistent behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like input is handled consistently with other types of indexers, addressing the bug and aligning the behavior with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
