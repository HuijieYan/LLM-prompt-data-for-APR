### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the input `key` is a list-like object properly, leading to KeyError exceptions when trying to access non-existent indices. This issue is highlighted by the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` which expects consistent behavior for different types of keys like list, array, Index, and Series.

### Error Location:
The bug seems to originate in the branch where the function checks if the `key` is not list-like and attempts to access `self.loc[key]`. This leads to errors when the key is a list-like object and some elements are not present in the Series index.

### Bug Cause:
The failing test aims to fetch values that do not exist in the Series by providing a key (`['C']`) that is not present in the Series index. The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when it tries to access the non-existent key directly using `self.loc[key]`, which triggers a KeyError due to the mismatch between the key and the index.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the input `key` is a list-like object before directly accessing it using `self.loc[key]`.
2. Implement logic to handle cases where some elements in the key do not exist in the Series index to prevent KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # handle list-like objects
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            key = list(key)
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating safeguards for list-like objects and handling cases where keys do not match the Series index, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and prevent KeyError exceptions.
