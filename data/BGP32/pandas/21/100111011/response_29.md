### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list-like scalars, Index objects, and lists. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like keys.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior of the function when indexing with list, ndarray, Index, and Series objects. It expects a `KeyError` with a specific message when trying to access a value not present in the Series index.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key and tries to index the Series with it. It fails to handle the list-like key appropriately, leading to an incorrect handling of mismatches between the key and the Series index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the function `_get_with` to correctly handle list-like keys and raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message when necessary.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index object

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type in ["floating", "datetime64", "timedelta64", "object", "integer"]:
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a conversion step to ensure the input key is an Index object using `ensure_index(key)`.
2. Correctly infer the key type and handle different key types like floating, datetime, timedelta, object, and integer by accessing values via `self.loc[key]`.
3. If the key type is not recognized or present in the index, raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message.

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now handle list-like keys correctly and raise a `KeyError` when needed, resolving the bug identified in the failing test cases.
