### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` has a conditional branch that handles different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalars, list-like, Index, integer, list, etc.). The bug seems to be related to how list-like keys are handled, resulting in a KeyError when passing a list key to the Series.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test, a Series is created with values ["A", "B"].
- The key is created as a Series with value ["C"] and then converted to the type specified in the parameter (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series).
- When trying to access `ser[key]`, a KeyError is expected, but the KeyError is not raised as anticipated.
- The bug most likely occurs when handling list-like keys; the error message specifically mentions the representation of Index(['C'], dtype='object') that is not found in the index. This suggests a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual implementation of list-like key handling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the handling of list-like keys to match the behavior of array-like keys to prevent the KeyError from being raised.
2. Ensure that the list-like keys are correctly processed and return the expected values without errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]  # Fix: Use iloc for list-like keys

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the fix, the function now correctly handles list-like keys by using `iloc` instead of `loc`. This change aligns the behavior with array-like keys and should prevent the KeyError from being raised during the test.
