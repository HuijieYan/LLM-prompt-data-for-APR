### Analysis:
The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function is designed to check the behavior when trying to access an element from a Series using an index that does not match any value in the Series. The test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised, but the error message indicates that the error is not being raised.

### Bug Identification:
The bug in the function `_get_with` occurs at the following condition:
```python
elif not is_list_like(key):
    # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
    return self.loc[key]
```
When `key` is not list-like, the code tries to access the `loc` attribute with `key` directly, assuming that `key` is the label for the index. This is incorrect behavior because if `key` is not list-like, it must be treated differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function attempts to directly index a scalar when `key` is not list-like. This leads to the behavior of looking for the value `key` as an exact match in the index, leading to the unexpected behavior in the failing test case.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we should handle the case when the `key` is not list-like differently. We can update the condition to correctly handle the scenario by using the `iloc` method instead.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Use iloc for single label
        return self.iloc[[key]]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle scalar values as keys when not list-like and return the expected behavior, passing the failing test case.
