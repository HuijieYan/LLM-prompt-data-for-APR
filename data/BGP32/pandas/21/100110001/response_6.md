### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file contains logic to handle different data types of `key`. However, there is an issue in the handling of keys that are not list-like. The buggy function correctly handles cases when `key` is a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, but fails when `key` is not list-like.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` provides an example where the bug occurs. It tests the behavior when `key` is assigned to a Series object but not list-like. The expected outcome is a `KeyError` since there is no match in the index, but the buggy function does not raise this correctly due to the issue in handling non-list-like keys.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling keys that are not list-like. The function tries to access `self.loc[key]` directly for a non-list-like key, which fails to raise the necessary `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if the key is not list-like, it should be treated in a way that raises a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index. We can achieve this by using a conditional statement to check if `key` is not list-like and then raising a `KeyError` explicitly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Raise a KeyError as this is not list-like
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the explicit `raise KeyError` statement for non-list-like keys in the corrected function, we ensure that when trying to access an index that does not exist in the series, a `KeyError` will be raised as expected, fixing the bug.
