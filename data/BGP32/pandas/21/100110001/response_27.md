### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series based on their data type. The bug seems to be related to processing the `key` argument passed to the function. Currently, the function is not correctly handling the case where the `key` is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug can be attributed to the way the function checks and processes the `key` argument. It fails to properly handle the case when `key` is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series, which results in it not being able to handle the indexing correctly. This leads to the failing test cases that expect the appropriate behavior when indexing with a key of the specified types.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can correctly process and index the Series based on the type of key provided. We should modify the function to handle the different key types properly, enabling it to return the expected output when indexing with a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle indexing with list, numpy array, Index, and Series keys. It should pass the failing test case mentioned earlier.
