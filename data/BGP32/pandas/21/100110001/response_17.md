### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function in `pandas/core/series.py` is meant to handle various types of keys being passed to it for indexing.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is triggering a `KeyError` while trying to index a `Series` object `ser` with a `box` key that doesn't match any values in the index of `ser`.
3. The error message indicates that the test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised in this case, but it is not being raised.
4. The bug might be in the mechanism of handling keys and deciding whether they are list-like or not within the `_get_with` function. It seems like the logic for treating the keys appropriately is incorrect.
5. To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the different types of keys being passed to the `_get_with` function and ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the key passed is treated appropriately based on its type:
   - If the key is a list-like object (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`), try to index using `loc` and handle the case where the key does not match any values in the index.
   - If the key is not list-like, raise a `KeyError`.
2. Modify the if-else conditions within the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the different types of keys.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuple is not "
            "supported, use appropriate column or single value."
        )
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index.")        
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        if not key:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index.")
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handling non-list-like cases where key is a scalar or unsupported type
    raise KeyError(f"Unsupported key type: {type(key)}")
```

By correctly identifying the key types and handling them appropriately, the corrected version of the function ensures that a `KeyError` is raised when needed.
