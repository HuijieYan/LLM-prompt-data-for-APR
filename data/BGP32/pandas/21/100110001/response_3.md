### Analysis:
The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from the `pandas` library is intended to handle indexing operations based on the type of key provided. The failing test is trying to index a `Series` object with another `Series` object containing a non-matching value.

### Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the block of code handling the case where the key is not list-like. When the key is not list-like, the buggy function tries to access it using `.loc[key]`, which leads to an incorrect index lookup.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from attempting to index the `Series` object using a non-matching key, in this case, a key that is not present in the index of the series. This causes a `KeyError` since the key does not exist in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check whether the key exists in the index before trying to access it. If it does not exist, we can raise a `KeyError` with a message indicating that the key is not present in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or tuples is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif is_scalar(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"Index '{key}' not found in the Series index")
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
                raise KeyError(f"One or more keys do not exist in the Series index: {key}")
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle duplicate indexing case
    if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"One or more keys do not exist in the Series index: {key}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to explicitly check whether the key exists in the index before performing any operations with it, the bug can be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
