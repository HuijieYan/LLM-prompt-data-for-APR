### Analysis:
1. The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function is testing the behavior of the `ser[key]` operation when `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series.
2. The buggy function `_get_with` is selecting the appropriate path based on the type of `key` provided.
3. The bug is likely in the `key` handling logic of the `_get_with` function, which doesn't handle all types correctly. This bug causes incorrect selection and indexing behavior for certain types.
4. We need to ensure that the handling logic for different types of `key` is correct and consistent to pass the failing test.
5. We need to handle the case where `key` is a list, numpy array, or pandas Series to ensure that the correct indexing behavior is maintained.

### Solution:
The bug can be fixed by checking for `list`, `np.ndarray`, and `Series` specifically before moving on to other checks. If the `key` is of any of these types, it should be treated consistently for correct indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when `key` is of type `Index`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, or `Series`, it directly uses `self.loc[key]` for correct indexing behavior, passing the failing test cases.
