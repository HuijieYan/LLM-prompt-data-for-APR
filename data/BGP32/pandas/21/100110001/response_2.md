### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file tests the behavior when trying to access a key that does not exist in the Series index.
- The error message indicates that an expected `KeyError` was not raised when it should have been.


### Potential Error Location:
- The key types are being tested and processed in the function, but there might be an issue with the conditional checks or logic flow that determines how to handle the different key types.


### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises from the conditional check for handling keys that are not list-like.
- The logic checks for different key types could be leading to an incorrect path of execution, causing unintended behavior when non-existent keys are accessed.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The conditional statements for handling different key types should be reviewed to ensure correct branching logic.
- Specifically, the part of the code that deals with keys that are not list-like should be carefully examined for potential issues.


### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        raise KeyError("Invalid index type")  # Newly added to raise KeyError for invalid type
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes an additional check for `ABCSeries`, raising a `KeyError` for an invalid index type.


### Note:
- It's important to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure that it now behaves as expected and passes all relevant tests.
