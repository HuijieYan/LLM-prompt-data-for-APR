## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object in Pandas. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses different types of keys like list, numpy array, Index, and Series to test the behavior of the function.

The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when an invalid key is used to index a Series. However, the function is not raising the correct error when such keys are used. This mismatch between the expected error and the actual outcome causes the test to fail.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The conditional check `elif not is_list_like(key):` appears to be used to manage non-list-like scalars, but the implementation with `return self.loc[key]` can lead to incorrect return values when the key is invalid.
2. The section where the function deals with different data types for the `key` could be causing issues in handling Index objects correctly.

## Explaining the cause of the bug

The function fails to raise a `KeyError` as expected in the test when an invalid key (in this case, the key "C" which is not present in the Series) is used. This failure is due to the improper handling of key types and the absence of proper checks for such scenarios.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies invalid keys and raises a `KeyError` when such keys are encountered during indexing. Proper checks and exception handling must be implemented to deal with different key types.

## Corrected version of the `_get_with` function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"KeyError: '{key}' is not present in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to raise a `KeyError` if the key is not list-like or recognizable. This ensures that an error will be raised for invalid keys as expected in the failing test. Also, we improved the handling of key types to ensure correct behavior when indexing the Series.
