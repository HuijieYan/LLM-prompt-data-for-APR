### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the Series class of pandas is intended to handle different types of indexing keys for a Series object.
2. The failing test is aimed at checking if a KeyError is raised correctly when trying to access a non-existent index element using different types of indexing keys.
3. The error message indicates that the test failed because the KeyError was not raised as expected, implying that the `_get_with` function is not handling the key properly.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the `key` variable when it is of type `list, np.ndarray, Index, or Series`.
5. It appears that the function is not properly checking the type of the `key` variable and thus not processing it correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle various types of `key` input, especially list-like types such as `list, np.array, Index, or Series`.
2. The function should correctly interpret the `key` type and perform appropriate operations based on that type.
3. We need to update the logic within the function to correctly handle the provided `key`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the modifications above, we ensure that the function can handle different types of `key` input correctly. This corrected function should pass the failing test successfully.
