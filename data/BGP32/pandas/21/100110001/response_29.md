### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is attempting to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, but there are several issues:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` is incorrect as it will fail for list-like objects. It should be checking if it's not a scalar.
2. The logic for handling different key types such as Index, list, and other types is not consistent and may lead to incorrect behavior.
3. The function does not handle the case where a key is a Series object, leading to a TypeError.

### Bug:
The bug in the function `_get_with` is that it incorrectly handles the case where the key is a list-like object, causing it to throw a KeyError in the test function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` to check if the key is a scalar.
2. Simplify the logic for handling different types of keys, ensuring a consistent approach.
3. Add a proper check to handle the case where the key is a Series object to avoid TypeError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported."
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Updated Version with Bug Fix:
In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the bug is fixed by properly handling the key types and introducing a check for handling a Series object key.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
