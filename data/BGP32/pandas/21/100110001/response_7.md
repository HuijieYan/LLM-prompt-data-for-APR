### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to retrieve values from a Series based on a given key.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to retrieve a value from a Series with a key that doesn't exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError`.
- The error message indicates that the test did not raise a `KeyError` as expected.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function `_get_with` handles keys that are not found in the index.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when the key does not exist in the index. It does not raise a `KeyError` as expected.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case when the key does not exist in the index and raise a `KeyError` in that scenario.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame/Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame/Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not all(elem in self.index for elem in key):
        raise KeyError(f"Some elements in {key} are not in the index")

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function should now correctly handle cases where the key does not exist in the index and raise a `KeyError` in such situations. This fix ensures that the function behaves as expected when dealing with keys that are not present in the index.
