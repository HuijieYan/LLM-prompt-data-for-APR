### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input `key` to index a Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` passes different types of inputs to the Series, expecting a KeyError to be raised if the key is not present in the index. The function is currently not handling the case where the input is a Series. 

### Bug Identification:
1. The current implementation does not handle input `key` being an instance of a Series.
2. The `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` condition is being invoked incorrectly. It should only be checking for individual types and not in a combined tuple.
3. The function needs to return `self.index[key]` instead of `self.loc[key]` for the case when key is not list-like and is not recognized as a scalar.

### Bug Cause:
The function fails because when a Series is passed as a key, it is classified under the `else` condition and then treated as list-like or scalar. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior and a `KeyError` is not raised as expected.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check for `isinstance(key, Series)` before other type checks.
2. Simplify the type checking condition for key.
3. Correctly handle individual types within the condition statements.
4. Make sure to return `self.index[key]` for non-list-like and non-scalar keys.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.index[key]

    if not (is_list_like(key) or is_scalar(key)):
        return self.index[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key_type = ensure_platform_int(key)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.index[key]
        else:
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.index[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying the corrected `get_with` function, the failing test should pass successfully without raising an error.
