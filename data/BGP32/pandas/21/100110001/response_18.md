### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class from `pandas/core/series.py` is expected to handle different types of input keys for slicing, pandas `ABCDataFrame`, tuples, non-list-like objects, and various other types like lists, NumPy arrays, `ExtensionArray`, `Series`, and `Index`. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles keys that are **not** list-like objects.

In the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, different types of inputs are tested for key access on a `Series`. The test case expects a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access keys that are not present in the index.

### Bug:
The bug is in the conditional logic for non-list-like keys. If the key is not list-like, the current implementation attempts to use `.loc` to access the key, which is incorrect. This leads to a mismatch when the test tries to access a key that is not present in the index, resulting in the test failure.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional block that handles non-list-like keys. Instead of using `self.loc[key]`, we should raise a `KeyError` explicitly for keys that are not in the index.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should now correctly handle non-list-like keys and raise a `KeyError` when the key is not present in the index. This will align the behavior with the expected result in the failing test cases.
