### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of input keys when indexing a Series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series index and expects a `KeyError` to be raised. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling this case, leading to a failure in the test.

### Identified Issue:
The bug is likely occurring in the portion of the code where the function tries to determine the type of the `key` before returning the corresponding result. It incorrectly handles certain types of keys and does not raise the `KeyError` as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function does not handle the case when the input key does not match any index values in the Series. This leads to incorrect behavior where the `KeyError` is not raised when it should be, causing the test to fail.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if the input key is not found in the Series index, a `KeyError` should be raised as expected by the test.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

With this corrected version of the function, the `KeyError` will be raised when the input key is not found in the Series index, fixing the bug and allowing the failing test to pass.
