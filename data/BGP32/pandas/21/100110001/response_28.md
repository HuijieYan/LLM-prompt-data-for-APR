### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a pandas Series. However, there are multiple issues in the function that are causing it to fail the test cases. One issue is with the handling of `Index` objects, where the condition to check if the key is an instance of `Index` is incorrect. Another issue is with the handling of checking key types, especially when dealing with different data types of keys.

### Bugs in the Function:
1. The condition to check if the key is an instance of `Index` is incorrect.
2. Incorrect handling of key types, leading to errors in specific scenarios.

### Suggested Fix:
The function should correctly identify the key types and handle them accordingly. The key type detection should be improved to cater to different types of keys such as lists, arrays, and `Index` objects. Additionally, the function should be able to handle edge cases like scalars.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    # Check for different key types
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = key.values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ('integer', 'boolean'):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By appropriately handling different key types and conditions, the corrected function above should now pass the failing test cases.
