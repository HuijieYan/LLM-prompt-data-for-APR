### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` includes a section for handling different types of input keys and returning corresponding results. However, there are multiple potential issues present in the implementation:
1. When checking if the key is a list-like object, the logic is insufficient and returns data from `self.loc[key]`, which is likely to cause a `KeyError` in certain cases.
2. The segment for handling key types other than slices and DataFrames could be improved to avoid potential issues with unsupported combinations of keys.

### Bug Cause:
In the failing test, a Series object is created with values 'A' and 'B', while another Series object 'key' is created with value 'C'. The test then attempts to access 'ser[key]', where 'key' is a list-like object. However, the _get_with function does not handle this case correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access an element from an index that is not present.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. Instead of assuming that a list-like key should be used directly for indexing, we should process it differently to avoid errors. A strategy could be to raise a `KeyError` for invalid keys that are not part of the index.

### Corrected Implementation:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError("Key error: Key must be list-like or scalar")
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self[key]
```

By using `ensure_index(key)` for list-like keys and then directly indexing to the series, we ensure that the key will match the index and prevent `KeyError` from occurring. This approach enhances the stability of the function and aligns with the expectations of users trying to access values from a Series object.
