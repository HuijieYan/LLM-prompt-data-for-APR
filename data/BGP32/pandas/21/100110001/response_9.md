## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is trying to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series, but it has a bug where it is not properly handling the case when the key is not present in the index.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is checking for the behavior when attempting to get a key that is not present in the Series index. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError`, but the buggy function is not handling this case correctly.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from not properly handling the scenario when the key is not present in the Series index. This causes the function to not raise a `KeyError` as expected in such cases, leading to the failing test.

## Fix:
A potential fix for this bug would be to explicitly handle the case when the key is not found in the index and raise a `KeyError` in that scenario. This ensures that the behavior matches the expectation in the failing test.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Raise KeyError if key is not found in index
    if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check to ensure that the key is present in the index and raising a `KeyError` if it is not found, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
