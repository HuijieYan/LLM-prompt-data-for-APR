### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `pandas/core/series.py` file is designed to handle various types of key inputs when indexing a pandas Series object. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type of key passed.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` file is designed to test the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that does not match any values in the Series index. The test expects a KeyError to be raised in this situation.

The failing test uses different types of key boxes (list, numpy array, Index, Series) to index the Series object.

### Bugs in the `_get_with` function:
1. The function checks if the key is an instance of `Index` but does not handle the case where the key is of type `pd.Series`.
2. When a key is passed as a tuple, the function tries to call `_get_values_tuple(key)`, which may not be a valid operation for all types of keys.
3. In the conditional block for checking if the key type is `"integer"`, the decision to use `loc` or `iloc` based on `self.index._should_fallback_to_positional()` can lead to incorrect indexing behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Add handling for `pd.Series` type keys in the function `_get_with`.
2. Modify the condition for checking tuple keys to handle valid operations for all key types.
3. Reconsider the logic for indexing based on integer keys to ensure correct behavior in all cases.

### Bug-fixed `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        # Return based on tuple key values for valid types
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The bug-fixed version improves handling of key types, particularly when indexing with a tuple key and when dealing with integer keys. The fixed version should pass the failing test and provide correct indexing behavior for the pandas Series object.
