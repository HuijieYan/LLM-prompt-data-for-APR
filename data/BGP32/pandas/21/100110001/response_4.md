### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Failing Test

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of inputs used for indexing a series. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing if an error is raised correctly when trying to access values in a series using an index that does not match any values in the series.

The failing test uses different types of index containers like list, numpy array, pandas Index, and pandas Series to pass as the index key to the series. The test expects a `KeyError` to be raised when values in the provided index are not present in the series.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations

The function `_get_with` uses multiple conditionals to determine the type of index provided and how to handle it. The specific issue causing the failing test to fail is likely related to the handling of the input keys, especially when they are not found in the series.

### Explaining the Bug

The failing test fails because the handling of the input key in the `_get_with` function does not raise a `KeyError` when the provided index doesn't match any values in the series. This results in incorrect behavior when attempting to access non-existent values.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an index key is provided that does not match any values in the series, a `KeyError` is raised. This means that the code logic in the `_get_with` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle this scenario and raise the appropriate exception.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this corrected version, if the index provided does not match any values in the series, a `KeyError` will be raised, as expected by the failing test. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave correctly when handling non-matching index keys.
