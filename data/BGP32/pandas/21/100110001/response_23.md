### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The failing test is trying to index a Series with an element that does not exist in the index, expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.

### Issues:
1. The `isinstance(key, tuple)` condition is incorrect as `key` is an instance of `list`.
2. The conditional check for `is not list_like` should come before other conditional checks to handle scalars properly.
3. The check for `isinstance(key, list)` should come before the check for `key_type == "integer"` to avoid misclassification.
4. The return statement for `isinstance(key, list)` should call `self.reindex(key)` instead of `self.loc[key]`, as it is handling a list of keys.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Rearrange the conditional checks to handle list-like elements first, scalars next, and finally other types.
2. Correct the type check for keys like tuple and list.
3. Use the appropriate indexing method based on the type of the key.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
    return self._slice(slobj)
``` 

After applying these changes, the corrected function should handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing test case.
