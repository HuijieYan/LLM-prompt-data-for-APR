The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a pandas Series correctly. The currently provided implementation checks if the key is an instance of `Index` before it checks if it is an instance of pandas Series. This is problematic because a pandas Series is also an instance of Index, leading to the wrong condition getting executed.

To fix this issue:
1. We need to move the check for pandas Series before the check for Index.
2. Update the condition for Index to be checked after all other types. If the key is an instance of Index, it should get handled separately.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks for all the types of `key` sequentially and handles each case appropriately.

After applying this fix, the provided test cases should pass without raising any errors.
