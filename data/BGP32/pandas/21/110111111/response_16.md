To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle list-like key types correctly. The issue arises when using a list as an indexer, where the error message indicates that none of the keys are in the index. This behavior is inconsistent with other index types.

The key problem lies in how the key is processed in the function. In the case of a list-like key, the function should interact with it differently to handle the indexing correctly.

To resolve the bug, we should modify the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like keys. We need to extract the data from the series using indexing without raising a KeyError when all the keys are not found in the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            series_key = key
            try:
                return self.loc[series_key]
            except KeyError:
                return self.reindex(series_key)
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the case when `key` is not list-like by attempting to locate the key in the series using `self.loc[key]` and falling back to `self.reindex(key)` if a KeyError is raised. This modification ensures that the function can handle list-like keys and return the expected output without raising errors.

By implementing this adjustment, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of key inputs, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
