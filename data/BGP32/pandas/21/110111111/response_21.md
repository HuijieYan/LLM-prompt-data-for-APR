Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the bug seems to occur in the block where it handles non-list-like keys. Specifically, when a key is not recognized as list-like, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which can raise an error if the key value is not present in the index. This issue aligns with the failing test cases provided, where the function fails to handle certain index types properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of non-list-like keys to ensure that the function behavior is consistent across different index types. We can introduce a check to verify if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it using `self.loc[key]`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is in the index, then proceed
    if self.index.isin(key).any():
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a check to ensure that if the key is not found in the index, then the function should not attempt to access `self.loc[key]` directly. This change should address the issue with the failing test cases and make the function behavior consistent across different index types.

Please verify this corrected version by running the failing tests to ensure that the bug is fixed and the expected input/output values are satisfied.
