The issue here is related to how list indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The failing test case involves passing a list indexer that leads to a `KeyError` because it's not properly handled within the function.

### Bug Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` currently does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements not present in the index.
2. The key issue arises from the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, specifically not properly handling list-like indexers.
3. The key type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, indicating a problem with type inference for the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers, ensuring that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
Here is an updated version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issues mentioned above:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    if isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list indexers, providing a consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolving the `KeyError` issue in the failing test cases.
