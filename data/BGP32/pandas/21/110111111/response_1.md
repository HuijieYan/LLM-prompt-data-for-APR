## Correction

Based on the analysis and the expected behavior outlined in the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of indexers within the `_get_with` function. The correction involves treating all indexers consistently to avoid the KeyError raised in the failing tests.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, list)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version treats all indexers consistently, ensuring that the KeyError raised in the failing tests is avoided. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers.

After applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test cases, satisfying the input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue.
