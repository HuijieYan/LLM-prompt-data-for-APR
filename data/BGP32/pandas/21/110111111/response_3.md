Based on the analysis provided, the bug seems to stem from the handling of the key parameter in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The issue is related to how different types of indexers are processed, leading to inconsistent behavior when using a list indexer to access elements that are not present in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function can correctly handle list-like indexers and raise a `KeyError` when trying to access elements not present in the index.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = key.tolist()

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version ensures that when a list-like key is provided, and the elements are not present in the index, a `KeyError` is appropriately raised to maintain consistency with other types of indexers. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the `_get_with` function behave as expected in all cases.
