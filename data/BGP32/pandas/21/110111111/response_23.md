## Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is failing when indexing with a list-like object (`key`) that does not match any values in the index of the series.
2. The failing test cases demonstrate that the behavior differs when indexing with a list compared to array-like objects like numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.
3. The buggy function incorrectly handles list-like objects as well as certain other index objects, leading to a KeyError due to mismatched values.
4. The expected behavior is to align the indexing behavior across different types of objects and raise a KeyError when the key does not exist.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like objects consistently with other array-like objects.
2. Ensure that the function raises a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index.
3. Align the indexing behavior across different types of objects to maintain consistency.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to raise a KeyError when the key does not exist in the index, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing tests.
