Based on the analysis of the buggy function, failing test cases, runtime input/output values, and expected input/output values, the bug originates from how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list. The issue is related to the check for list-like indexers and results in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly. The correction involves distinguishing between different types of list-like indexers and ensuring that the function behaves consistently for all cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the function will handle list-like indexers consistently, fixing the KeyError issue identified in the failing test cases. This fix should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue regarding the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.

Please try this updated function with the failing tests to ensure that it now passes all the test cases and behaves as expected.
