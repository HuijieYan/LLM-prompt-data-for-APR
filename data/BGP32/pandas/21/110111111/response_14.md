Based on the information provided, the issue seems to be related to the behavior difference when indexing a Series with list, array-like, Index, or Series objects, especially when there are no matches in the index. The failing test is expecting a KeyError to be raised in all cases, as the value 'C' is not present in the index of the Series 'ser'. However, the behavior is inconsistent when using list key indexing.

The buggy function `_get_with` is handling the different types of indexers but not consistently raising a KeyError when the index is not found, which causes the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that a KeyError is raised consistently when the key is not found in the Series index. We should modify the function to handle list-like objects correctly in terms of error handling.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Raise KeyError when the key is not found in the index
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when a key is not found in the Series index for list-like objects, a KeyError is raised consistently as expected by the failing test cases.

After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases and maintain consistent error handling when indexing with different types of objects.
