The issue with the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list. The function is not correctly handling the case when a list indexer is passed, leading to a KeyError in some scenarios.

## Bug Explanation
- When the function receives a list-like key (in Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3), it mistakenly treats it as an Index object in some branches of the logic, which leads to an incorrect type inference as 'integer' instead of 'string', causing the subsequent KeyErrors.
- The issue arises from the incorrect type inference for list-like objects, leading to the wrong path being taken in the conditional flow handling different types of indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic to accurately identify the type of the key and handle list-like objects appropriately. Ensure that list-like keys are processed correctly to avoid the KeyError.
- Update the conditional checks for different types of keys to include specific handling for list-like objects to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        
        if len(key) == 0 or len(key) > 1:
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            key = key[0]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string" or key_type == "mixed-integer-strings":
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we handle the list-like key more accurately, ensuring that the correct path is followed based on the type of the key. This correction should resolve the KeyError seen in the failing test cases.
