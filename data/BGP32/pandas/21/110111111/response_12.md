The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the incorrect handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer, which leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent values. To address this issue, we will modify the function to treat all indexers consistently and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.

Here is an updated and corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the function to always convert the `key` to a list before processing, we ensure that all indexers are treated consistently, preventing the `KeyError` issue when using a list indexer. This corrected version aligns with the expected input/output values described in the analysis above, effectively resolving the bug.

This revised function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output without encountering the `KeyError` problem.
