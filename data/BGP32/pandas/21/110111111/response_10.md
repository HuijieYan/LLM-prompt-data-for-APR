Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the failing tests, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `_get_with` function is likely related to how list-like indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers.

The root cause of the bug is the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers. When a list indexer is used, the function fails to handle it properly and raises a KeyError. This inconsistency can be observed in the failing tests where list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers are tested, but only the list indexer fails.

To fix this bug and make the function handle list indexers correctly, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function will now handle list-like indexers properly and align with the behavior of other types of indexers. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests and match the expected input/output values.
