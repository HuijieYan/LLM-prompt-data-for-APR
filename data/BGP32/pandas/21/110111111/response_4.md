Based on the information provided, the bug seems to occur because the function `_get_with` doesn't handle the `'list'` case correctly. When a list is passed as the key, the function tries to convert it to an Index, but it fails to match the key with the index values and raises a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects.

To fix this bug, we need to add a case to handle the list type key correctly and provide the expected behavior as seen in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the list indexing case by converting key to Index before reindexing
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a specific case for handling lists as keys. It converts the key to an Index object using `ensure_index` before trying to reindex the Series. This change should now make the function work correctly for list-type keys and pass the failing test cases, aligning the behavior with other indexers like arrays or Index objects.
