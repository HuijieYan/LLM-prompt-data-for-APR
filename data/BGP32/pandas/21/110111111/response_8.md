Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing test cases, the issue arises from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, which fails to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. The function should distinguish between different types of key inputs and process them accordingly.

The key issue in the failing test is that when accessing the Series with a list indexer, it raises a KeyError that is inconsistent with the behavior for other types of key indexers like ndarray or Index.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key indexes appropriately. We can achieve this by explicitly checking if the key is a list using the `is_list_like` function from pandas, and then handle it differently from other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is list-like
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version explicitly checks if the key is list-like and uses `loc` to access the Series when it is a list. It aligns the handling of different types of key input to provide consistent behavior. This correction should resolve the KeyError raised in the failing test and align the behavior with the expected output for list-like key indexes.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like key indexes correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
