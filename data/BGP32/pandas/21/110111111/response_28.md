The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from how different types of indexers are handled. The function fails to correctly process list-like indexers, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases. To address this issue, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of key indexers in the function.

The source of the bug can be traced to the part of the function where it tries to handle different types of key indexers. There is an inconsistency in how list-like indexers are processed compared to other indexers, leading to the failure observed in the provided test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers. By ensuring that all types of indexers are processed correctly, we can prevent the `KeyError` from occurring during the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like or scalar
    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, list-like indexers will be handled consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issues observed in the failing test cases.
