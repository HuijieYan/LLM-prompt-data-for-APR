Based on the analysis provided, the bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `pandas.core.series.Series` class. When the function encounters a list-like indexer, it fails to properly handle it, resulting in a KeyError in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly. Specifically, we should ensure that list-like indexers are treated consistently regardless of their origin (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series). 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We check if the `key` is list-like using `is_list_like` function.
2. If the `key` is list-like, we convert it to an Index using `ensure_index`.
3. This ensures that no matter the type of list-like indexer provided, it will be handled consistently.

By making these adjustments, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list-like indexers, resolving the KeyError issue reported in the failing test. This fix aligns with the expectation described in the failing test and satisfies the GitHub issue raised regarding the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers.
