The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of the key parameter, especially when it is a list-like object. The function fails to properly handle list indexers, resulting in a KeyError. The key issue is related to how different types of indexers are processed, leading to inconsistent behavior with list indexers compared to other types.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. We should modify the function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other indexers to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring consistent treatment of different types of indexers and handling list indexers similarly to other indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing tests and meet the expected input/output values.

This fix addresses the inconsistency in behavior for indexing with list-like objects as reported in the GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".
