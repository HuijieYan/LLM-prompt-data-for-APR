## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing tests, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of list indexers differently from other indexers. To fix this bug and make the behavior consistent across different types of indexers, we need to modify the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction makes sure that list indexers are handled in the same way as other indexers, leading to consistent behavior and resolving the error raised by the failing tests.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of indexers, including lists, arrays, Index objects, and Series objects, providing the expected results and passing the failing tests.
