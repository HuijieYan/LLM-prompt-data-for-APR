Based on the analysis of the buggy function and failing tests, it is evident that the issue lies in how the function `_get_with` handles different types of key inputs, specifically when a list key is used. The function does not handle the list-like key properly and results in a KeyError during the test execution.

To fix this issue, we need to update the handling of list-like keys to align with how other indexers are treated. We should ensure that accessing the Series with a list key behaves consistently compared to other types of keys, such as array-like or Index keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_list(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)

def _get_values_list(self, key):
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

In this corrected version, we introduced a new method `_get_values_list` to handle list-like keys specifically. This method attempts to access the Series using the `loc` indexer with the list key. If a KeyError is raised during this operation, it will be caught, and a more informative error message will be raised.

By implementing this change, the function should now correctly handle list-like keys and provide consistent behavior when accessing the Series with different types of keys, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
