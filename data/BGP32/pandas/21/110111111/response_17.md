## Bug Explanation:

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object. The function expects the `key` to be an array-like structure, but fails to handle a list in the same way, leading to different results and raising a `KeyError` in certain cases.

When the function receives a list as the `key` parameter, it attempts to treat it as an index and fails to find the corresponding values in the `self.index`, resulting in a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` is a list-like object, it is correctly handled to avoid the `KeyError`. This can be achieved by converting the list-like object into an array-like object before further processing. By standardizing the handling of different types of objects as keys, we can ensure consistent behavior across all cases.

## Corrected Function:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the check and conversion for list-like keys, this corrected function should now handle all types of keys consistently and prevent the `KeyError` issue encountered in the failing test cases.
