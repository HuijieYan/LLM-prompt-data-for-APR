## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle the case when the input key is a list properly, leading to an incorrect behavior resulting in a KeyError. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like input keys correctly and returns the appropriate output. Specifically, we should adjust the logic to handle list-like inputs consistently for various types like Index, Series, ndarray, and list.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the function `_get_with` to handle list-like input keys correctly by considering all possible types of the key.
2. Ensure that the function returns the appropriate value based on the input key type to avoid raising a KeyError.

Let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and the bug fix strategy.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle list-like input keys appropriately
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the issue should be resolved, and the failing test cases should pass successfully. The function now handles list-like input keys consistently for different types and returns the appropriate values without raising a KeyError.
