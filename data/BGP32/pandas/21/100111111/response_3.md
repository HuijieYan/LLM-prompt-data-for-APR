## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling a non-matching key for indexing a Series. The issue arises when the key is supplied as a list. The function incorrectly processes the list key, leading to an error in the test cases that expect proper handling of non-matching keys.

In the failing tests, the function is called with keys of different types (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`), and the test cases expect consistent behavior for all types of keys when they do not match any values in the Series index. However, the function does not handle the case of a list key properly, causing the test to fail.

The function checks if the key is not list-like and then tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`. However, when the key is a list, the function continues to `reindex(key)`, which leads to the KeyError. This inconsistency in handling non-matching keys of different types causes the tests to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles non-matching keys correctly, specifically for list keys. We should modify the logic for handling non-list-like keys to avoid the KeyError when reindexing. Instead, we should return `self.loc[key]` for list keys as well.

By adjusting the condition to handle list keys like other non-list-like keys, the function should provide consistent behavior for all types of keys when they do not match any index values.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle non-list-like keys properly

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]  # Return loc[key] for list keys as well

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this modification, the `_get_with` function should now handle non-matching list keys consistently with other types, ensuring correct behavior and passing the failing tests.
