## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, when the key is a list-like object, the function fails to handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

In the failing test, the key is converted to an array, index, or Series, but when it is a list, the function fails to process it properly. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers causes the function to raise an error when a list-key is provided.

The issue on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers to improve consistency and coherence in how different types of indexing operations are handled.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that list-like objects are handled properly alongside other types of indexers. We should align the behavior for list indexers with array-like, index, and Series indexers to ensure consistency across different types of indexers.

The fix involves modifying the logic within the function to correctly process list-like keys and avoid the `KeyError` that currently occurs when a list-key is provided.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the necessary modifications to handle list-like keys properly, ensuring that all types of indexers are processed consistently and preventing the `KeyError` issue.
