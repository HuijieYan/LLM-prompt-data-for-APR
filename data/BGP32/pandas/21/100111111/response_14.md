### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list is used as an indexer, the function raises a KeyError even though it should behave similarly to other array-like indexers.

The failing test case uses a list as an indexer and expects the behavior to be consistent with other array-like indexers. However, the function currently does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError being raised.

The function incorrectly processes the list indexer, leading to an error in cases where it should return valid results. This inconsistency in handling different types of indexers causes the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list indexers so that it behaves consistently with other array-like indexers. The function should return the expected results when a list is used as an indexer.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list indexers properly and pass the failing test case. It ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers and produces the expected output.

This fix aligns with the reported issue on GitHub, addressing the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series.
