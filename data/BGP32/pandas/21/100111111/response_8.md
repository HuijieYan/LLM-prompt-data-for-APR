### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, integers, lists, arrays, etc. In this case, the failing test is utilizing a list-like indexer to access elements from a Series.
2. The issue arises because the function treats list-like indexers differently from other array-like indexers, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access elements using a list.
3. The failing test expects that accessing elements using a list should behave consistently with other array-like indexers in a Series, but the current implementation results in a `KeyError`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly to provide the expected behavior and pass the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Identify the block of code that handles different types of indexing methods.
- Modify the handling of list-like indexers to match the behavior of other array-like indexers.
- Ensure the function distinguishes between different indexers correctly and returns the desired output without raising a `KeyError`.
- Update the code to align with the expected behavior described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):  # Modified this condition
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying these changes to handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, the corrected function should pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
