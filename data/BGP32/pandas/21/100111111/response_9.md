## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series index, expecting a KeyError to be raised.
3. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled, particularly when using a list indexer.
4. The failing tests attempt to index the Series with different types of key objects like lists, arrays, and Index objects, expecting consistent behavior.
5. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list key compared to other types of keys.

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is used, the function incorrectly calls `self.reindex(key)` instead of raising a KeyError when the key is not found in the index. This leads to unexpected behavior when indexing with a list key.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when indexing a Series with a list key that contains values not present in the Series index, a KeyError should be raised consistently across all types of indexers. This will align the behavior with user expectations and resolve the inconsistency.

Let's correct the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers properly and raise a KeyError when needed.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handling list indexer when key not found in the index
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if any element in the given list key is not present in the Series index, we can ensure that a KeyError is raised consistently for list indexers when accessing a Series object. This correction aligns the behavior with the user expectations and satisfies the failing test cases.
