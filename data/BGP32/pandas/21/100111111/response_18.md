### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` when indexing with a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
3. The error occurs because the function incorrectly processes list-like keys and fails to reindex them properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function to align with the expected behavior in the failing test.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list, ndarray, Index, Series as keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

The fix includes:
1. Checking for list, ndarray, Index, or Series keys and using `ensure_index` to ensure proper index type.
2. Validating if all elements of the key are present in the Series index.
3. Reindexing with the key if all elements are found or raising a `KeyError` if none exist.

By making these adjustments, the function will correctly handle list-like keys and pass the failing test, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
