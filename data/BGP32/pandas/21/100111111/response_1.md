## Bug Explanation

The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various iterables. The bug arises when the `key` parameter is not recognized as list-like and is not an instance of specific types like Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.

In the failing test cases, the `key` parameter is a Series containing one element `'C'`. When attempting to index the Series `ser` with this key, the function incorrectly expects the key to be list-like or of specific types, which leads to a KeyError during the retrieval operation.

The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with list-like objects compared to other types like np.ndarray or Index. The bug causes the function to handle list-like keys differently, leading to the KeyError inconsistency.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like keys, ensuring consistency across different types of indexers. By extending the support for list-like keys, we can align the behavior in line with the expectations of the failing tests and resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

## The Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Fix for handling list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly handle list-like keys when indexing a Series, ensuring consistency across different types of indexers and passing the failing tests. This fix aligns the behavior with the expected input/output values and resolves the inconsistency raised in the GitHub issue.
