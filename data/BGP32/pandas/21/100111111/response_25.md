The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer, causing a KeyError when it should not. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list indexers to match the behavior of other indexers.

Based on the analysis of the failing tests and expected values, we need to modify the logic inside the function to handle list-like keys correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we replaced the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` with `elif is_list_like(key):` to correctly handle list-like keys. This change ensures that list indexers are processed properly, avoiding the KeyError that occurred in the failing tests.

By making this adjustment, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.
