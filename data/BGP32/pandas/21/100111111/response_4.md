Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue seems to lie in the handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently to avoid unexpected errors such as the KeyError raised in the failing test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    # Unified handling for different indexers
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers are handled consistently, preventing the KeyError raised in the failing tests. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue pointing out the inconsistency in handling different indexers.
