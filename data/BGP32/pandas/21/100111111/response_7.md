## Fixing the Bug in the `_get_with` Function

### Issue Analysis:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when a list-like key is passed to access values in a Series object. The function fails to handle list-like keys properly, leading to a `KeyError`. The failing test cases indicate that the function treats different types of indexers inconsistently, especially when a list key is provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is primarily caused by the function not handling list-like keys correctly. When a list key is passed, the function does not properly recognize it, leading to the `KeyError` since it cannot locate the values in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled appropriately in the `_get_with` function. The function should treat list keys the same way it treats other array-like keys to maintain consistency in indexing behavior.

### Updated Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if not self.index.is_unique:
        return self._get_values_list(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key) and len(key) > 0:
        if lib.is_scalar(key[0]):
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.loc[ensure_index(key)]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added `ensure_index` function to convert the key to an Index object to ensure consistency.
2. Added additional checks to handle list keys by calling `_get_values_list` function when `is_list_like(key)` and `self.index.is_unique` is False.
3. Implemented a conditional check for scalar keys within list-like keys to handle them appropriately.
4. Removed redundant checks and streamlined the logic for better clarity.

### This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug and ensure consistent behavior when handling different types of indexers.
