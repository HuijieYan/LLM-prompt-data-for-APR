## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of Pandas treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers when attempting to retrieve values. When a list indexer is used, it raises a `KeyError` with a specific message, while array-like indexers produce a different behavior.

The failing test cases demonstrate that when using an index that doesn't match any values in the series, the `KeyError` should be raised consistently for all types of indexers (list, numpy array, Pandas Index, or Pandas Series). However, the current implementation of `_get_with` does not handle list indexers in the same way as other indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to treat list indexers in the same way as other types of indexers (numpy array, Pandas Index, and Pandas Series) when generating a `KeyError`. This consistency will align with user expectations and make the behavior of the function more coherent across different indexer types.

## The Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the inconsistency in handling list indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if key and isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if key_type == "boolean":
            raise NotImplementedError("Boolean indexing not supported yet")

        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version ensures that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently when attempting to access values in the series. The function now correctly raises a `KeyError` with a uniform message when the provided index does not match any values in the series.
