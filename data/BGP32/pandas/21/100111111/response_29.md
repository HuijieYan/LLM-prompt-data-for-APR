The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of different types of indexers when accessing a Series. When a list-like indexer is used (e.g., a list, ndarray, Index, or Series), the function fails to correctly handle the case where the indexer does not match any values in the Series index. This inconsistency causes the function to return incorrect results or raise unexpected errors.

The failing test cases demonstrate that when using a list, ndarray, Index, or Series as an indexer that does not match any values in the Series index, the function does not raise a KeyError as expected. This behavior is inconsistent with how the Series should handle these indexers according to the provided examples.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` should be modified to properly handle list-like indexers that do not match any values in the Series index. The correction involves ensuring that when a key from a list, ndarray, Index, or Series is used as an indexer and does not match any values in the Series index, a KeyError should be raised to maintain consistency and expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)) and not self.index.isin(key).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check to raise a KeyError when the list-like indexer does not match any values in the Series index. This adjustment ensures that the function behaves consistently and handles such cases appropriately.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
