### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. When the input key is an array-like object, the function works as expected. However, when the input key is a list of values, the function fails to handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError` as observed in the failing tests.

The function contains conditional checks for different types of keys, including slices, data frames, tuples, and non-list-like objects. When the key is a list, the code path does not handle it properly, causing the `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access the element that does not exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent behavior for list indexers and array-like indexers when accessing elements in the Series. This involves updating the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like inputs correctly.

### Updated `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = np.array(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle cases where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list-like indexers are properly converted to NumPy arrays before further processing, ensuring consistent behavior for all types of indexers. This modification should allow the function to handle the input keys correctly and pass the failing tests.
