## Fixing the Bug

### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers when indexing a Series. However, when dealing with a list-like indexer, it fails to handle the case properly, leading to a `KeyError`. The failing test cases highlight this issue, showing inconsistencies in behavior between different types of indexers.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug stems from the handling of list-like indexers in the function. Specifically, the code does not properly account for list-like indexers, leading to the incorrect return and causing a `KeyError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the mismatch in how different types of indexers are processed inside the `_get_with` function. When encountering a list-like indexer, the function does not handle it correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access an element that does not exist in the Series index.

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers. By updating the handling of list-like indexers to match the behavior of other indexers, we can avoid the `KeyError` and provide expected results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation:
In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the handling of list-like indexers has been updated to be consistent with other types of indexers. By checking if the input key is not list-like and then converting it to a list if necessary, we ensure that list-like indexers are processed correctly and do not result in a `KeyError`. This adjustment aligns the behavior of list-like indexers with other types, resolving the issue identified in the failing test cases.
