### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the way list-like indexers are handled differently from other types of indexers. The failing test is trying to access an element from the Series `ser` using a key that is a list-like object (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`). The `_get_with` function has different handling logic based on the type of key provided, which leads to inconsistent behavior.

In the failing test, when a list indexer `key` is used, the function raises a `KeyError`, stating that none of the items in the index are found. This is because when `is_list_like(key)` is True, it tries to access the element using `self.loc[key]`, assuming it to be label-based, causing the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list-like indexers. We can modify the logic to handle list-like indexers in a way that aligns with the expected behavior, avoiding the KeyError while accessing elements.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or is_list_like(key):  # Added condition for list-like keys
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a condition to handle list-like indexers similar to list indexers, we ensure that the behavior is consistent across all types of indexers, fixing the bug and aligning with the expected input/output values.
