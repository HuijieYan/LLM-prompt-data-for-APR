The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Index) when indexing a Series. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that the behavior for list indexers differs from array-like and Index indexers, leading to unexpected KeyErrors.

The problematic part of the function is the handling of key types and the decision-making process to use `self.loc[key]`, `self.iloc[key]`, or `self.reindex(key)`. In the failing test cases, the key is a list or array-like, which triggers the KeyError because the function incorrectly expects an Index type.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle list and array-like key types consistently with Index types. One approach is to convert all non-Index key types into lists before further processing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version of the function ensures that all non-Index key types are converted to lists before key_type inference and further processing. This change aims to handle list and array-like key types consistently with Index types, resolving the KeyError issues observed in the failing test cases.

By updating the `_get_with` function as described, the corrected implementation should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values, resolving the identified bug.
