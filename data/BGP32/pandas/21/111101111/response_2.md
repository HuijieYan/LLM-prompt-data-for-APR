## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the Pandas library. When the function is called with an index that is a list, it doesn't handle it correctly, leading to a KeyError during indexing. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled (e.g., arrays, Index, Series).

## Bug Location

The issue arises in the section of the function where it checks if the `key` parameter is not list-like. When encountering a list key, it tries to convert it to an Index object but fails to handle it properly, resulting in the KeyError.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to handle list-like keys the same way as other types like arrays, Index, and Series. This can be achieved by treating the list-like keys consistently within the conditional blocks, avoiding unnecessary conversions that lead to the KeyError.

## Bug Fix

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the bug fix applied:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handle list-like keys (no need to convert to Index for list-like keys)
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the condition flow to handle list-like keys within the existing conditions and avoiding unnecessary conversion, the function now behaves consistently for various types of indexers. This revised version should pass the failing test and address the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
