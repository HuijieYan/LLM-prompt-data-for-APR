First, let's analyze the bug in the `_get_with` function:

### Issue:
The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. Specifically, when a list indexer is used, it throws a `KeyError` with a message stating that none of the items in the index are found. This behavior is inconsistent with array-like indexers.

### Reason for the Bug:
1. When a list indexer is provided, the function incorrectly tries to handle it differently than array-like indexers.
2. The function fails to properly process the list indexer, leading to a `KeyError` being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers. By modifying the condition for list-like indexers, we can resolve the inconsistency and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes to the `_get_with` function, we ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers, which resolves the `KeyError` issue reported on GitHub.
