The issue arises from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class when handling different types of indexers. Specifically, when a list indexer is provided, the function fails to handle it correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.

The root cause of the bug lies in the conditional block handling list-like indexers. The code fails to check if the list indexer contains valid index values, leading to the `KeyError` when trying to access those values from the series.

To fix the bug, we need to refine the logic for handling list-like indexers to ensure that it works consistently with other types of indexers. Additionally, the error issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior across different indexers, so the fix should aim to provide a uniform approach while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if all values in the list indexer are present in the series index before attempting to access them. This approach ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the `KeyError` issue highlighted in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.

By implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like indexers correctly and pass the failing test cases while addressing the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
