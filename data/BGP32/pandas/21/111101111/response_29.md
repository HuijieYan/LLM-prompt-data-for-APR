### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in which it fails to handle the case where the key is a list-like object properly. When the key is a list, the function incorrectly tries to iterate over the list elements and process them separately, causing the KeyError exception to be raised because it cannot find the list items in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. Instead of treating each element of the list individually, we should pass the entire list to the `reindex` function to align the Series data according to the list values.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that will resolve the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex([key])
```

With this correction, the `key` variable will be checked for being list-like, and if it is, the entire list will be passed to the `reindex` function, solving the KeyError issue.
