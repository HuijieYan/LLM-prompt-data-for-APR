## Analysis:
1. The `Series` class in the pandas library has a buggy function `_get_with` that is responsible for handling different types of indexers. The failing test is due to the inconsistent behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, triggering the `is_list_like` condition in the function.
3. The bug causes incorrect behavior when accessing elements using a list indexer, leading to a `KeyError` exception. This behavior differs from array-like indexers and is inconsistent with the expected functionality, as highlighted by the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers to prevent the `KeyError` exception.
5. The corrected function below addresses the mentioned issue and aligns the behavior for list indexers with array-like indexers.

## Correction:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Modify to ensure list indexers are handled consistently
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = [key]
            key_type = 'scalar'
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ['integer', 'scalar']:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the handling of list indexers to be consistent with array-like indexers, the corrected function retains the expected functionality and resolves the inconsistency issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report.
