The issue in the buggy function lies in the conditional statements that handle different types of input keys. The problem arises when processing a list key due to the incorrect handling in the conditional blocks. The return behavior for list keys is not consistent with other types of keys, leading to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list keys are handled correctly within the function for a Series object. First, we should check if the key is a list-like object, and then perform the necessary operations to avoid the KeyError when accessing the index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys appropriately
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        if all(isinstance(item, str) for item in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This fix ensures that list-like keys are correctly processed to prevent the KeyError when accessing the index. The function now differentiates between string-based keys and other data types when handling list keys.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and behave consistently for different types of keys, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
