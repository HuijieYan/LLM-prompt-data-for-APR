## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is handling different types of `key` inputs inconsistently.
2. The bug is related to how the function processes the `key` parameter when it's an instance of a list, causing different behavior compared to when it's an instance of other types like numpy arrays or pandas Index.
3. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when `key` is a list, while it should be returning a similar result as when `key` is a numpy array or pandas Index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all different types of `key` inputs are processed consistently to avoid the `KeyError` and align the behavior with the expected output.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Identify the location in the function where the inconsistency arises based on the input types of `key`.
2. Modify the code to handle the list type input similar to how other types like numpy arrays or pandas Index are handled.
3. Ensure that the function returns the expected values for all types of `key` inputs to pass the failing test cases and align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug causing the `KeyError` to be raised for list inputs should be resolved. This correction should align the behavior of handling different `key` types consistently and pass the failing test cases.
