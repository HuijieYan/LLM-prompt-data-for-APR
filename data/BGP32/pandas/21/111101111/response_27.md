After analyzing the buggy function, the failing test, the runtime input/output values, the expected input/output values, and the GitHub issue, we can identify the cause of the bug:

- The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the conditional blocks for handling different types of key inputs. When a key is a list, the function treats it differently compared to other types such as ndarray or Index, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all key types are handled consistently. We will modify the function to treat all key types in a uniform way, avoiding the KeyError that occurs when a list key is used.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version uses the `ensure_index` function to convert all key types to Index type before further processing, ensuring consistency in handling different key inputs.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently for all types of key inputs, passing the failing test and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
