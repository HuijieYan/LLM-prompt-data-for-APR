### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class handles various types of input `key` including slice, DataFrame, tuple, and other types. The issue arises when the input `key` is an index-like object such as a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
2. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects compared to other index-like objects, leading to unexpected errors and different results.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior of indexing with different types of index-like objects, revealing the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers. The expected behavior is to handle list-like indexers similarly to other index-like objects.
4. To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to handle list-like indexers consistently with other index-like objects to align with user expectations and resolve the reported GitHub issue regarding inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional block for handling list-like objects in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent treatment with other index-like objects.
2. Determine the appropriate behavior for list indexers to align with user expectations and resolve the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
3. Update the indexing logic for list-like indexers to match the behavior of other index-like objects like Index, ndarray, and Series.

### Bug-free Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like objects in the `_get_with` function to consistently treat them like other index-like objects, the bug causing inconsistent behavior in indexing with different types of objects is fixed. The corrected function aligns with user expectations and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
