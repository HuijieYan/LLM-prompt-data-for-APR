The issue described on GitHub points out the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers in the `Series` class. The failing test case demonstrates this behavior, where using a list key results in a `KeyError`, while using other array-like key types like ndarray or Index does not.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class where the condition checking for `list` key is not handled properly. When the key is of type list, it is not correctly processed, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of list-type keys within the `_get_with` function to align it with the behavior of other array-like key types. The goal is to ensure consistency across different key types to avoid the `KeyError` for list keys.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes handling for list keys similar to other array-like keys, ensuring consistency in the indexing behavior across different key types.

By making this fix, the `KeyError` issue for list keys in the failing test case should be resolved, aligning the behavior with the expectations and fixing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
