### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with different types of indexers. When the key is a list, the function incorrectly handles it, leading to a `KeyError` exception. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are processed, causing the failing test.

The issue arises from the incorrect handling of list-like indexers, resulting in a key error when trying to access the values using the `loc` method. The function should correctly handle list indexers to align with the behavior of other index types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for handling list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that list indexers are processed in a way consistent with how other index types are handled to avoid the `KeyError` exception. By modifying the conditional checks for list-like indexers, we can align the behavior with the expected output as described in the failing test cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic for handling list-like indexers and ensuring consistent behavior with other index types, the corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and provide the expected output.
