### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class handles different types of indexers such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and other types. The issue arises when dealing with list-like indexers.
2. The bug is causing an inconsistency in behavior when using list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is expected to raise a `KeyError`. However, the bug causes the behavior to be inconsistent when using list-like indexers.
4. The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of list indexers in the conditional branches of the function. The bug leads to unexpected behavior and a failed test.
5. To fix the bug, the conditional branch handling list indexers should be adjusted to provide consistent behavior with other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is treated as an Index

    key_type = key.inferred_type  # Infer the type of the key
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list indexers
    return self.loc[key]
```

By explicitly ensuring the key is treated as an `Index` and handling list-like indexers separately at the end of the function, the bug causing inconsistent behavior with list indexers should be resolved. This fix ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers.
