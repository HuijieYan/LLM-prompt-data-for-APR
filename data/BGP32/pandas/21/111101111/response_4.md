## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object, such as slices, tuples, lists, arrays, or Index objects.
2. The bug occurs when a key of type `list` is passed to the function. It fails to handle this case properly and results in a KeyError.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is specifically designed to expose this bug by passing a key of type `list` to the Series object, causing the function to throw a KeyError.
4. The expected behavior is for the function to handle list indexers the same way it handles other array-like indexers (such as arrays, Index objects) without throwing an error.

## Bug Cause:
In the `_get_with` function, when a key of type `list` is encountered, instead of handling it correctly, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which raises a KeyError due to mismatched types.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a key of type `list` is passed to the function, it is handled in a way consistent with the handling of other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the logic to appropriately handle the list indexer case.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now correctly handle list indexers in a manner consistent with other array-like indexers. This correction should resolve the KeyError issue highlighted in the failing test.
