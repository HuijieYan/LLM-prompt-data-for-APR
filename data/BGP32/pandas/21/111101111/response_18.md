The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically failing to handle list-like indexers correctly. The failing test case demonstrates the different behaviors for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers, leading to a KeyError in the list case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled properly, similar to other types of indexers. The corrected version of the `_get_with` function below addresses this issue and aligns the behavior for all types of indexers.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function now correctly handles list-like indexers by converting them to a list before accessing the values through `self.loc[key]`. This change resolves the KeyError issue observed in the failing test case and aligns the behavior with other types of indexers.

After implementing this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test case, providing consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series indexers.
