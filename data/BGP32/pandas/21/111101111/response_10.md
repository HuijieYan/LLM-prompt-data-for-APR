## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class has conditional logic to handle different types of input `key`.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, and it fails to handle that case properly, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test cases.
3. The failing test expects the behavior for list/ndarray/Index/Series to be the same when accessing elements in the `Series`, but the current implementation handles list input incorrectly, leading to the error.
4. The key issue relates to how different types of indexers are handled, causing inconsistency in the behavior.
5. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and points out the specific behavior difference when using a list indexer.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the conditional block that handles a non-list-like input, where a list input is incorrectly identified as not list-like. This leads to the incorrect processing of the input `key` when it should be treated as a list.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list input is correctly identified within the conditional logic of the function. Specifically, when the input `key` is a list, it should be processed appropriately to avoid the `KeyError`. We will modify the logic to correctly handle list input as expected.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        # Handle list, Series, or Index input correctly
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

Applying the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug and ensure that the behavior for different indexers is consistent, resolving the `KeyError` in the failing test cases.
