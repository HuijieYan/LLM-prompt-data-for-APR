## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the `key` parameter is a list correctly. It is expected to return `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like scalars but is not properly handling list-like keys. This issue is related to a test case where the behavior for list indexers differs from array-like indexers, causing an inconsistency.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is a list, and the function tries to index the Series with that list. The function incorrectly categorizes list-like keys and does not handle them properly, leading to a KeyError in cases where the index is not found. This inconsistency is highlighted in the failing test where the same operation behaves differently for different types of keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When the `key` is a list, we should directly return `self.loc[key]` instead of trying to convert it to other types. This approach will align the behavior for list indexers with the behavior for other array-like indexers.

## Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function specifically addresses the issue of properly handling list-like keys by returning `self.loc[key]` when the key type is recognized as a list. This change aligns the behavior for list indexers with other array-like indexers and resolves the inconsistency highlighted in the failing tests.
