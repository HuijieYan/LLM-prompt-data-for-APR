## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when dealing with different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) for indexing a Series object. The issue arises from inconsistent behavior in how these indexers are processed, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

### Error Cause
1. When a list indexer is used, the `_get_with` function tries to handle it as a non-list-like key, leading to a KeyError exception.
2. The behavior for list indexers differs from ndarray, Index, and Series indexers, causing inconsistency in indexing methods and results.
3. The implementation of handling different types of indexers in this function is not unified, leading to unexpected errors and failures in some test cases.

### GitHub Issue Summary
The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers in the Series class. The test case added in Issue #5880 fails due to this inconsistency, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

## Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency issue, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) are treated consistently within the `_get_with` function. This involves updating the conditional statements and indexing logic to handle different types of indexers correctly.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns the behavior for different types of indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Convert non-list-like key to a list to handle scalar indexers
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    # Handle different types of indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the behavior for different types of indexers should be aligned, addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
