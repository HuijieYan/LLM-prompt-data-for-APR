Looking at the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue arises when the input `key` is an array-like object and not recognized as a list-like object, causing the function to run into an error. The function handles different types of input for `key`, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, and others. However, when the input `key` is array-like (array, Index, Series), it fails to handle them correctly, leading to the error described in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the function treats the array-like objects differently and does not handle them properly, resulting in a KeyError when trying to index the Series with an array-like object.

To fix the bug, we can specifically handle array-like objects (array, Index, Series) in a similar way as list-like objects. By ensuring consistent handling of different types of indexers, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for array-like objects (`np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to be treated similarly to list-like objects when indexing the Series. This modification ensures consistent handling of different indexer types, preventing the KeyError when indexing the Series with these types of objects.
