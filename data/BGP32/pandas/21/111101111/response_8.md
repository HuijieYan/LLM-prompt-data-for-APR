Based on the analysis of the buggy function, the failing tests, and the expected input/output values, the bug is likely occurring due to the inconsistency in the treatment of different types of indexers. The function `_get_with` encounters issues when handling certain types of indexers, especially when dealing with cases where the key is a list.

To fix this bug and align the behavior with the expected output, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently. Specifically, we should modify the section of the code that deals with non-array-like indexers, such as lists. This modification should ensure that the key is correctly processed and used for indexing without causing errors like the one observed in the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, we ensure that the `_get_with` function can handle different types of indexers consistently, including lists. This correction should allow the function to pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values.
