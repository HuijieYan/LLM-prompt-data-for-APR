The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. The issue arises when passing a list-like key to the Series object, causing unexpected behavior. The function incorrectly branches based on the type of the key and fails to handle the list case properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the function to handle list-like keys consistently with other types of keys. We should ensure that the function treats list keys in the same way as other array-like keys to maintain consistency and prevent errors.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like keys to a list

        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is converted to an Index

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures that list-like keys are treated consistently with other array-like keys. By converting non-list-like keys to a list and ensuring they are converted to an Index, we can avoid the KeyError issue that arises when passing list-like keys.
