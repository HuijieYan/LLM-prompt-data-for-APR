### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` handles different types of input `key` for indexing the series.
2. The function contains conditions to handle different types such as `slice`, `ABCDataFrame`, `tuple`, etc.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of a list-like input `key`. There is an issue with how the function processes a list-like key for indexing. The function fails to handle the case when the key is a list and not an array-like object properly.
4. Based on the GitHub issue, there is inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with a list that results in a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN` values.
5. The bug needs to be fixed by correctly handling list-like keys to align with the expected behavior in other indexing scenarios.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function fails to handle list-like keys properly. When a list is passed as a key for indexing, the function should return `NaN` values for non-existent keys instead of raising a `KeyError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should treat list-like keys properly for indexing by returning `NaN` values for keys that do not exist in the Series, aligning with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Code Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]  # Handle non-list-like keys
    
    for k in key:
        if k not in self.index:  # Check if key exists in the index
            return np.nan
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]  # Return values for existing keys
    
    return self.reindex(key)  # Fallback to reindex for remaining cases
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that when a list-like key is provided for indexing, the function iterates over the keys and returns `NaN` values for keys that do not exist in the Series. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug related to list-like key indexing.
