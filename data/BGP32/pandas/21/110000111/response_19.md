### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of key types within the function, leading to unexpected behavior.
3. The expected input key types are list, ndarray, or Index, but the function seems to incorrectly process some key types.
4. The bug reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how different key types are handled, especially when using a list as an indexer.
5. The bug is causing issues with indexers that don't match any values in the Series.

### Error:
The bug occurs when a list key is provided, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially raising errors due to incorrect handling of the key type.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of different key types within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to address the case when a list key is provided. We should make the function handle list-like keys correctly to avoid errors related to unmatched values.

### Corrected Function:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles list-like keys correctly and ensures consistency in how different key types are processed within the function. It should resolve the bug and align the behavior with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
