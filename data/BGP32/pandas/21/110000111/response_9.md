### Analysis:
The `buggy_function` `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`. The bug seems to be related to how the function processes key types and handles the indexer. The issue from GitHub suggests inconsistency in the behavior of the indexing method when using a list indexer.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of different key types, especially for lists
2. Inference of key types and the decision for positional or label-based indexing
3. Reindexing based on the key type

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistent treatment of different key types when the indexing operation is performed. Specifically, the function does not handle list keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of all key types for indexing. Proper type inference and correct decision-making for label-based or positional indexing are essential. Additionally, reindexing should be done appropriately based on the key type.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        if key.dtype == np.bool_:
            key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.is_extension_array_dtype:
        key = key.array

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different key types, including lists. It properly infers the key type, converts list-like keys to indexes, and handles the indexing operation accordingly. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
