## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in pandas/core/series.py.
2. Expected input parameters include `key` (a list, ndarray, Index, or other types), `self.index` (a RangeIndex), and `self` (a Series object).
3. The function `_get_with` currently has a bug related to handling different types of key inputs.
4. The bug causes inconsistent behavior when trying to access elements using list indexers.
5. The bug arises due to differing treatment of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.
6. The cases provided give insight into the expected behavior and types of variables at different stages within the function.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of different types of key inputs within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the function treats list indexers differently from other types of indexers (like ndarray or Index). This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior, especially when accessing elements using list indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent treatment of all types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. This involves handling list indexers in a similar way to other types of indexers to maintain uniform behavior.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle different key types consistently, the bug related to list indexers is resolved. The corrected function ensures uniform treatment of all types of indexers, leading to expected behavior across different scenarios.
