### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used in the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function is meant to handle different types of keys (slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars) for indexing a Series.
3. The bug occurs when the input key is not recognized by the function and it tries to index the Series in an incorrect way.
4. The key issue mentioned in the GitHub problem suggests that list indexers should behave consistently with other types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the key is not recognized as a specific type in the if-elif chain, it converts the key into a list but later tries to reindex the Series with this list key, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers behave consistently with other types of indexers. This involves handling list keys the same way as other valid indexers and avoiding unnecessary conversions and reindexing.

### Updated `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):                
        if not is_integer(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This updated function ensures that list indexers are treated the same way as other indexers, such as accessing the elements directly. It removes unnecessary reindexing when the key is recognized.
