## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input `key` and perform operations based on the type of input.
2. The function has multiple `if` conditions to handle different input types like slice, `ABCDataFrame`, tuple, etc.
3. The bug seems to be related to how different types of `key` are handled, especially when `key` is a list.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a `Series` with a list key, compared to other types of keys.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `key` is a list. The function does not handle list-like keys consistently with other types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior and possibly raising errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of keys. We can modify the logic for handling list-like keys to align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the function, list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of keys, ensuring a uniform behavior when indexing a `Series`. This should resolve the bug and align with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
