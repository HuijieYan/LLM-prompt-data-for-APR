### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys (e.g., slice, DataFrame, tuple) and perform indexing operations based on the key type. However, there is a bug present in how it handles key types, particularly when dealing with list-like keys. The function incorrectly processes the key type and does not return the expected output for certain cases.

### Identified Error:
The main error lies in the conditional checks for key types. When handling non-list-like keys, the function falls through all the conditional statements and should ultimately use `self.loc[key]` if the key is not list-like. However, due to incorrect branching logic and missing checks, the function does not return the correct result for certain key types, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes incorrect handling of different key types, specifically when the key is list-like. This is evident from the GitHub issue provided, where the behavior of the function for list indexers is inconsistent with other indexers. The function fails to properly process list keys, leading to unexpected exceptions and incorrect results.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks for different key types and ensure that the function behaves consistently for all types of keys. Specifically, when encountering a list-like key, the function should correctly handle it without raising errors or returning unexpected results.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if len(key) == 0:
            return self.reindex(key)  # Handle empty list case
        else:
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246, and correct key handling for list-like keys
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I added a check to handle the case where the key is empty when it's a list. Additionally, the branching logic for list-like keys has been adjusted to ensure correct handling and prevent unexpected errors or results. This corrected version should now handle different key types consistently and resolve the issues described in the GitHub bug report.
