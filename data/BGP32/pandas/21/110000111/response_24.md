## Analyzing the buggy function
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles non-matching index keys.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition for handling `not is_list_like(key)` might not be correctly implemented.
2. The way it handles different types of key inputs might not cover all cases.
3. The logic for determining `key_type` may not be handling certain cases properly.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to stem from an inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers. The function does not correctly handle cases where the key provided does not match any index values. This issue is evident from the GitHub problem description, which points out that different types of indexers behave inconsistently, and `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles cases where the key does not match any index values. This may involve adjusting the logic for determining the `key_type` and the conditions for returning the correct values.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- We have added a `try-except` block around `self.loc[key]` to catch `KeyError` and then try to `reindex` if the key doesn't match any index values.
- By introducing this exception handling, we aim to replicate the behavior observed in the GitHub issue, where the list indexer (`ser[list(key)]`) leads to a `KeyError`. This approach aligns the handling of different types of indexers to resolve the inconsistency.
