### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is responsible for retrieving values from a Series based on different types of keys like slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, etc.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys, where the correct data retrieval is not happening as expected.
3. The expected behavior for list indexers is not consistent with other indexers, leading to incorrect behavior when retrieving data using list keys.
4. The bug is identified as an inconsistency in handling list indexers, leading to KeyError in specific cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused due to the inconsistent behavior of how list indexers are processed compared to other indexers like arrays or indices. The function misinterprets list indexers, leading to a KeyError when attempting to retrieve data based on list keys.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we should ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers like arrays or indices. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic for processing list-like keys to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key = np.array(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version aligns the handling of list-like keys with the expected behavior for other types of indexers, ensuring that data retrieval is consistent across different key types, thus resolving the bug.
