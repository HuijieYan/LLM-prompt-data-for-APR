### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, ExtensionArrays, Series, and Index objects. The bug seems to arise from the handling of list-like key inputs.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the handling of a list-like key input when checking the type of the key and then trying to access the elements accordingly.

### Cause of the Bug:
When a list-like key input is encountered, the buggy function first checks if the key is not list-like by using the `is_list_like` function. If it's not list-like, it tries to access the element using `self.loc[key]`, assuming the key is a valid index. However, this assumption causes issues when dealing with specific types of key inputs, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of different key types is done correctly. Specifically, we need to address the case of list-like keys and ensure that the function processes them appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function addresses the issue with list-like keys to ensure proper handling of different key types based on the input provided.

By updating the code to correctly handle list-like key inputs, the function should now be able to return the expected output based on the provided test cases and resolve the issue highlighted in the GitHub post.
