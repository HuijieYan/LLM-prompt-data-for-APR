### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, such as a slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, etc. However, the bug arises in the handling of the `key_type` when the key is of an array-like type. This leads to inconsistencies in indexing behavior, as highlighted in the GitHub issue where indexing with a list causes an error.

### Error Location
The error lies in the determination of `key_type` for array-like keys, specifically in the block of code where `key` is not a single value but an array like `list`, `np.ndarray`, etc.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the code block for handling array-like keys does not distinguish between different array-like types. This leads to incorrect handling of the key, especially when it is a list, causing errors during indexing.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly identifies the type of array-like key being used. The handling for different array-like types should be distinct and consistent to avoid errors.

### Corrected Version
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            # Handling np.array keys separately
            key_type = 'numpy_array'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a separate handling for `np.ndarray` keys to differentiate them from other array-like types. Now, the function should be able to correctly index a Series using a list as the key without raising errors.
