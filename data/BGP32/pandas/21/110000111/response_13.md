The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the different types of indexers correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing the Series. The issue in the GitHub report highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly distinguishing between different types of indexers like lists, arrays, and indexes. This causes incorrect indexing behavior and results in unexpected errors or inconsistent outputs.

To fix the bug and address the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles different types of indexers and provides consistent behavior when indexing the Series.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert numpy array to list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue by properly handling different types of indexers like lists, arrays, and indexes. By making these adjustments, the function should now provide consistent and correct indexing behavior for the Series.

Please ensure to test the corrected function with the provided expected cases to verify that the bug has been fixed.
