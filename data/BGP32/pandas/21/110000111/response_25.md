### Analysis:
1. The `key` parameter passed to the `_get_with` function can be of different types: slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list like scalar, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index.
2. The function handles different cases based on the type of `key`, but there seems to be an issue in handling list-like keys.
3. The expected behavior for a list key is to return the values corresponding to the keys in the list, but the code seems to have inconsistencies in how it handles list-like keys.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to array-like indexers. The behavior for list indexers is not consistent with array-like indexers, leading to an issue in indexing with a list.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because list-like keys are not being handled consistently with other types of keys, causing a KeyError when attempting to access values using a list key.
2. The function should handle list-like keys similarly to array-like keys to maintain consistency.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling list keys to behave consistently with array-like keys to prevent the KeyError issue.
2. Ensure that when a list key is provided, the function retrieves the values corresponding to those keys without errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle list-like keys in a consistent manner with other array-like keys
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys to fetch corresponding values
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle integer type keys based on should_fallback_to_positional
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function handles list-like keys consistently with other array-like keys, allowing the function to return values based on the provided keys without causing a KeyError. It addresses the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue by ensuring that list indexers are treated similarly to other array-like indexers.
