1. **Analysis**:
   - The function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
   - The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on its type.
   - The bug seems to occur when handling a key that is not list-like, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]` which may lead to an error.
   
2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - The bug might be caused by the line `return self.loc[key]` when the key is not list-like.
   
3. **Bug Explanation**:
   - When a key that is not list-like is passed to the function, it checks if the key is an instance of a DataFrame, a tuple, or a scalar.
   - If the key is not list-like, it tries to access the `self.loc[key]` which may cause an error if the key is not found in the index.
   - This behavior is inconsistent with other types of key handling in the function.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling keys that are not list-like.
   - Instead of directly using `self.loc[key]`, we can handle such cases differently to align with the expected behavior.
   - It's important to handle the case when the key is not found in the index properly to avoid errors.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle key that is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex([key])

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the case when the key is not list-like appropriately by checking if the key is present in the index before accessing `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not found in the index, it will fall back to reindexing with the key provided.
