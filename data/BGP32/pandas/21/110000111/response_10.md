### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` function that handles different types of indexers and returns the corresponding values.
2. The bug occurs when the function encounters a key that is an instance of `Index`. In this case, it fails to correctly determine the key type and raises errors.
3. The bug is causing inconsistencies in how different types of indexers are handled, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the key type for all cases and handles them consistently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of `Index` instances in the `_get_with` function. When the key is an instance of `Index`, the function fails to determine the key type, leading to errors during execution.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is an instance of `Index` and extract the inferred type from it.
2. Use the inferred type if the key is an `Index` instance to determine the appropriate course of action.
3. Ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers to avoid the reported issue on GitHub.

### Correction:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = None    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if key_type is None:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly identified when the key is an instance of `Index`. It resolves the inconsistencies in handling different types of indexers, addressing the reported issue on GitHub.
