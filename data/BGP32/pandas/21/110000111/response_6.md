### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` function, which is responsible for handling different types of input keys and returning the corresponding values from the series.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles inputs that are not lists, arrays, or specific types. The issue on GitHub highlights discrepancies in behavior for different types of indexers.
3. The bug occurs when a key that is not recognized as a list, array, or specific type is passed. The function then tries to handle the key based on its type, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all different types of keys are handled consistently and produce the correct output in accordance with the expected input/output cases and the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the key and handle it appropriately based on whether it is a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.
2. Ensure that all unique cases are covered and return the correct values according to the expected input/output cases.
3. Update the function to handle all types of keys consistently to align with the requirements mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index key types
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat as positional or label-based indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version now handles different types of keys consistently and aligns with the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue's requirements.
