## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. However, there are inconsistencies in how it handles specific types of keys, leading to unexpected behavior. The function checks for various key types such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalar values. It also infers the key type and decides whether to use positional or label-based indexing.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys. The function does not properly handle list-like keys, as indicated by the GitHub issue description. When a list-like key is provided, the function does not return the expected result and can raise errors.

## Bug Description
When a list-like key is provided, the function `_get_with` does not handle it correctly. It should check for a list-like key and take appropriate action based on the type of key. However, the current implementation does not address this scenario properly, leading to inconsistencies in indexing behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should ensure that list-like keys are processed correctly and return the expected output. We can modify the code to handle list-like keys in a consistent and correct manner.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like keys and ensuring that they are processed correctly, the corrected function should now return the expected results for all input cases mentioned in the bug description. This fix addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue and improves the indexing behavior of the Series object.
