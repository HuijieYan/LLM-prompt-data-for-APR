## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing in a pandas Series. The bug seems to be related to how the function deals with different types of keys, specifically when the key is a list. The function checks for various key types and seems to have incorrect handling for list-like keys based on the provided GitHub issue.

## Error Locations
1. The part of the code that handles list-like keys appears to be problematic.
2. The return statements for different key types might not be handling lists correctly.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function receives a list-like key for indexing. The function does not handle lists correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to index the Series using a list. This issue is related to the inconsistent behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue where list keys are not treated the same as array-like indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly in the function `_get_with`. The strategy involves revising the logic for list keys to align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

## Updated `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and bug fix strategy:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes handling list keys using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent behavior with other key types and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
