## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is encountering issues when dealing with different types of indexers like lists, pandas Series, numpy arrays, and Index objects. The function is not handling all cases consistently, leading to potential errors. The GitHub issue "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]" highlights this inconsistency.

### Error Locations
1. The function should handle different types of key indexers consistently.
2. The function fails to correctly infer the type of the key, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The function lacks a cohesive approach to dealing with various types of key input.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises because the function `_get_with` does not have a unified strategy to handle different indexers, resulting in inconsistencies. In particular, the function fails to properly differentiate and handle cases involving lists and Index objects. This issue leads to unexpected behavior and errors when processing the key indexers.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, a consistent approach needs to be applied to handle various types of key indexers. The function should correctly identify the type of the key input and process it accordingly. By standardizing the treatment of different indexers, we can ensure that the function behaves predictably and avoids errors.

## Corrected Version
```python
# Fixed version of the _get_with function in the Series class
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (tuple, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now follows a consistent approach to handle different types of key indexers. It checks the type of the key input and processes it accordingly. This will help in resolving the inconsistencies and errors seen in the original buggy function.
