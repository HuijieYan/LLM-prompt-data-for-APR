## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` inside the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values from the Series data. 
2. The bug seems to occur when the input key is an array-like object, like a list, causing an issue with the indexing operation.
3. The bug is related to the discrepancy in handling different types of indexers (list, Index, np.array) causing inconsistent behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled correctly and consistently with other indexers when accessing values from the Series.
5. The primary focus should be on unifying the behavior for different types of indexers to maintain consistency.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, Index, np.array) are handled consistently. Specifically, for list-like indexers, we need to ensure that the correct values are retrieved from the Series data.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    inferred_key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if inferred_key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that for list-like indexers, the values can be accessed correctly from the Series data, maintaining consistency with other types of indexers.

By applying this fix, the behavior of the `_get_with` function should be consistent across different indexer types, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to inconsistent indexing behavior.
