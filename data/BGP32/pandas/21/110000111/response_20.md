### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers (such as slices, dataframes, tuples, etc.) to retrieve values from a series. The issue seems to be around the handling of list-like indexers.

### Identified potential error locations
1. The handling of `key` when it's not list-like may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The determination of `key_type` based on the type of `key` may not cover all possible cases.
3. Incorrect distinction between the different types of indexers may cause issues.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug arises from inconsistent handling of indexers in the `Series` class. Specifically, the function `_get_with` does not appropriately handle list-like indexers, leading to unexpected outcomes. This directly relates to the GitHub issue where the behavior of different indexers is inconsistent.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently to avoid raised errors.
2. Improve the determination of the `key_type` to cover all possible input scenarios.
3. Address the distinction between the different types of indexers appropriately.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle non-list-like scalars
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide on the indexer type based on the index
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Handle duplicate indexing case
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- List-like indexers are handled consistently with the addition of a specific check for non-list-like scalars.
- The determination of `key_type` is improved by directly inferencing the dtype of the key.
- The logic for distinguishing the types of indexers is appropriately maintained. 

This corrected version ensures that all indexers are handled correctly, addressing the inconsistencies highlighted in the GitHub issue.
