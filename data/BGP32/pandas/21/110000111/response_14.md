### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library, which deals with one-dimensional ndarrays with axis labels.
2. The function handles various types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, and list-like objects to retrieve data from the series.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers, where the code does not properly convert the key to a list causing issues in the return logic.
4. Based on the provided test cases and expected values, the bug occurs due to incorrect handling of key types when it comes to lists.
5. The key issue seems to be a discrepancy in handling list-like indexers compared to other types like slices or dataframes. The bug is associated with inconsistencies in behavior when using different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the conditional checks in the function. When a list-like key is encountered, the conversion to a list is incorrect, leading to issues with index alignment and data retrieval.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly converted to lists before further processing. This will align the behavior of list-like indexers with other types, ensuring consistency in data retrieval.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Ensure key is converted to a list

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are always converted to lists before processing, maintaining consistency in index handling across different input types.
