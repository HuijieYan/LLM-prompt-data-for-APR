### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of key inputs for a Series, but it has a bug related to the key types.
2. The function fails to correctly identify the key type in certain cases and may lead to incorrect behavior.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers in Series.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of different key types and align it with the expected behavior in the pandas library.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect identification of the key type, especially when it comes to list-like key inputs. This results in inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic to properly identify the key type for list-like inputs.
- Ensure consistent handling of various key types to align with the expected behavior in the pandas library.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version aims to properly handle the list-like key inputs in a way that is consistent with other types of indexers. It should align with the expected behavior and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
