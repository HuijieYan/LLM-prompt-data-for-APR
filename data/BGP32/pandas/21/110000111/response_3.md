## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers for a Series object. However, there are inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other types like slices, DataFrames, and tuples. This inconsistency causes issues when trying to use a list indexer with a Series object.

## Identified Errors
1. The function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to inconsistencies and potential errors.
2. The logic for distinguishing between different types of indexers is flawed, causing incorrect behavior when processing list indexers.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug lies in the conditional check for the type of indexers. When a list indexer is used, the function does not properly handle it, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly. Specifically, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key.inferred_type, str) and key.inferred_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function handles list indexers properly, ensuring consistency with other types of indexers and resolving the issue identified in the GitHub report.
