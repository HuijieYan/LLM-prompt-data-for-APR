### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers to retrieve values from the series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers, especially when `key` is not list-like.
3. The bug seems to be causing issues when the `key` is not list-like and the function tries to locate the key in the index using `self.loc[key]`.
4. The bug is related to the inconsistency in how different index types are handled, as reported in the GitHub issue, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to access values using non-list-like keys.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle non-list-like keys appropriately, leading to incorrect value retrieval from the series object. The specific issue arises when the function tries to locate a non-list-like key in the index using `self.loc[key]`, causing unexpected errors or results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles non-list-like keys when accessing values from the series object. We should align the behavior with the expected outcome described in the GitHub issue and ensure consistency in handling different types of indexers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]
        
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function includes proper handling for non-list-like keys by converting them to a list before proceeding to ensure consistent behavior when accessing values from the series object.
