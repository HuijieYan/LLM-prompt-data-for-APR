### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class contains the `_get_with` function, which aims to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series` object.
2. The function checks the type of the input key and performs specific operations based on the type.
3. The bug seems to stem from the handling of a list-like key. The function does not correctly handle a list key, causing unexpected behavior.
4. The GitHub issue indicates inconsistencies in how list indexers and array-like indexers are treated. The bug is related to this inconsistency.
  
### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function receives a list-like key. The function mistakenly treats the key as an Index object, leading to incorrect behavior. This results in unexpected outputs or errors when indexing the Series object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to differentiate between list-like keys and Index objects correctly. We should ensure that list-like keys are handled appropriately without mistakenly treating them as Index objects.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Differentiate the handling based on key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        # We already ensured key is an Index object
        if key.is_boolean():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Handle list type keys separately
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # For other cases, return reindexed values
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By differentiating the handling of list-like keys correctly and ensuring the appropriate type conversion and indexing methods are used, the corrected function should address the bug and provide expected results for the given test cases.
