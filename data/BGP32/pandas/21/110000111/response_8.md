### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers in a Pandas Series object. The bug seems to arise from how the function handles the different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and numpy arrays. The function appears to have issues when deciding whether to use `loc` or `iloc` for integer-based indexers and also when dealing with non-matching list-like indexers.

The GitHub issue highlights inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers on a Series object. Specifically, the issue points out differences in handling list indexers compared to other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError exceptions.

### Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of list indexers.
2. Inconsistent decision-making for `loc` or `iloc`.
3. Handling of different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers against other types of indexers while accessing a Series object. Incorrectly treating list indexers leads to unexpected behavior compared to other indexers.

### Fix Strategy
1. Update the condition for handling list indexers to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers.
2. Ensure consistent decision-making for using `loc` or `iloc` based on the inferred type of the key.
3. Enhance the handling of different types of indexers to prevent unexpected exceptions.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers by aligning the behavior for list-like indexers with other types of array-like indexers, and making a clear decision between `loc` and `iloc` based on the inferred key type.
