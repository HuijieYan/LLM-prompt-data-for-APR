### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of key inputs to index a Series object. However, the bug causes incorrect handling of the key, especially when it is a list type.
   
2. The bug seems to be occurring in the logic related to handling list-like keys, as specified in the GitHub issue.

3. The bug arises when a list-like key is provided, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and potential KeyError.

4. One strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys by converting them to proper index types before indexing the Series object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert list-like key to Index for consistent behavior
    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are converted to Index type using `ensure_index` function before proceeding with the indexing process. This should address the inconsistency in handling list-like keys and prevent potential KeyError issues.
