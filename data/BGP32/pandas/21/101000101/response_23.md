The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when determining the `key_type` variable. The code does not handle the case where `key` is a list-like object properly. Instead of correctly inferring the type of `key`, it results in providing a wrong type value. This issue can lead to incorrect branching decisions in the following code logic.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` variable is properly determined based on the type of `key`. We need to handle the case where `key` is a list, numpy array, extension array, Series, or Index separately to correctly infer the types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the type of `key` is correctly inferred and handled to determine the `key_type` variable. It should now correctly differentiate between list-like objects and other types of input to make appropriate decisions in the code logic for handling indexing.
