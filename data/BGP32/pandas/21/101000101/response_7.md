### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug seems to be located in the detection and handling of the `key_type`. From the provided expected cases, we can see that the `key` parameter can be of various types such as list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The expected `key_type` is set to `'string'` in all cases.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key_type` determination. The current implementation of the `_get_with` function fails to correctly identify the `key_type` for various input types which results in unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined for different types of keys. We can modify the code to check the type of `key` and assign the appropriate value to `key_type` based on the type of `key`. Additionally, we need to address the logic for handling different types of keys to ensure the correct behavior for each case.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = None

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key_type = "list"
        elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            key_type = "ndarray"
        elif isinstance(key, Series):
            key_type = "Series"
        elif isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = "Index"
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the `key_type` determination has been modified to correctly identify the type of `key`. Different types of keys are now properly handled, and the function should produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
