### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The issue arises when the input key is a scalar that is not recognized as a list-like object. The function fails to handle this case correctly, leading to a KeyError during the execution of `self.loc[key]`.

### Bug Explanation
1. When the input key is not recognized as a list-like object, the buggy code tries to use it directly with `self.loc[key]`. This approach raises a KeyError if the key is a scalar that is not present in the index.
2. The bug occurs because the code fails to account for non-list-like scalar keys that should be treated as single-item lists before indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle scalar keys appropriately. We can check if the key is not list-like and convert it to a list before further processing to prevent KeyError when using `self.loc[key]`.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Fixed the logic to handle non-list-like scalar keys
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert scalar key to a list

    if not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected code adds a check to convert non-list-like scalar keys to lists before proceeding with the indexing operations. This update ensures that scalar keys are correctly processed without resulting in a KeyError.
