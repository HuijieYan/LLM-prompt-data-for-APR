The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. When checking the type of `key`, the function mistakenly converts it to a list in some cases where it shouldn't, leading to unexpected behavior. This is especially problematic when dealing with different types of input data such as strings, arrays, or indexes.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling `key` based on its type and properly infer its dtype. We should ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of `key` and acts accordingly to return the desired result.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key` is properly handled based on its type and inferred dtype. It avoids unnecessary list conversions and appropriately differentiates between different types of input data. This version should now correctly handle various cases without unexpected behavior.
