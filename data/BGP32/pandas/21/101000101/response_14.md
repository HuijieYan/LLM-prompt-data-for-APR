### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys in a Series object. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `key_type` based on the input `key`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the case when the `key` is not recognized as a list-like object or an Index object. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to an incorrect determination of the `key_type`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the `key` is neither a list-like object nor an Index object properly. We should ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of the `key`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles cases where the `key` is not recognized as a list-like object or an Index object. It accurately infers the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` provided.
