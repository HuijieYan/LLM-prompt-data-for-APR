### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the appropriate output. However, there are issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior. The key issues identified are:
1. In the case when `key` is not a list-like object, the function attempts to access `self.loc[key]`. This is incorrect as `key` might not be a valid input for indexing.
2. In the case when `key` is not recognized as a list, an array, an ExtensionArray, a Series, or an Index, the code converts `key` to a list. This can cause unexpected behavior as the original data type of `key` might be lost in the process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Check if `key` is of specific types before performing any operations on it.
2. Handle cases where `key` does not match any expected types appropriately.
3. Ensure that the decision between using `self.loc` or `self.iloc` is made correctly based on the type of `key`.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise TypeError("Unsupported type for key. Expected list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index.")
    
    key_type = None
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function addresses the issues identified in the buggy implementation. It now properly handles different types of `key` inputs, ensures appropriate error handling for unsupported types, and correctly decides between using `loc` or `iloc` based on the type of `key`. This corrected version should now provide the expected behavior for the specified test cases.
