The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key input parameter. When checking the type of the key, the function incorrectly assumes that if the key is not recognized as a list-like object, it should be treated as a scalar and accessed using `self.loc[key]`. This leads to incorrect behavior when the key is actually a Series object.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the different types of keys, including cases where the key is a Series object. By making sure that the key is correctly identified and processed based on its type, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input scenarios.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, (Series, Index)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the necessary checks and handling for different key types, we can ensure that the function behaves correctly in all cases and returns the expected values as specified in the given test cases.
