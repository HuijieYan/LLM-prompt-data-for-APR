Based on the expected input/output values and the buggy function, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect identification of the key_type for non-list-like inputs. In the given cases, the key is not recognized correctly as a 'string' type, which leads to an incorrect branch execution.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the part of the function where the key_type is determined based on the input key. We should ensure that the key_type is correctly identified for non-list-like inputs to avoid the issue with branch execution.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key_type is correctly determined for non-list-like inputs before proceeding with the rest of the function logic. This should address the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected input/output values.
