### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys and perform appropriate operations based on the key type. The bug seems to arise from the mishandling of the `key` variable when it is not recognized as a list-like structure. The function attempts to access `key` using the `loc` attribute, which may lead to incorrect results if `key` is not a valid index.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the `key` variable is not recognized as list-like, and the function tries to access `key` using `self.loc[key]`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors in cases where `key` is not a valid index.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should check if `key` is a valid index before accessing it using the `loc` attribute. If `key` is not recognized as list-like or if it does not match any of the expected types, we should handle the case differently to ensure correct behavior.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle non-list-like key
        return self.loc[key] if is_scalar(key) else None

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function adds a check to handle the case when `key` is not recognized as list-like. It now returns `None` if `key` is not a scalar value. This modification ensures that the function handles various types of `key` correctly and prevents errors when accessing `key` using `self.loc[key]`.
