### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to how the function is handling the key when it is not recognized as a list-like object. Specifically, in the cases provided, the key is a scalar value ('C') being passed to the function.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to treat the scalar key as a list or array, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to handle the key for indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle scalar keys appropriately in the function. We can modify the logic to correctly handle scalar keys by using `.loc` to access the scalar value directly from the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly using `self.loc[key]` when the key is a scalar and not recognized as list-like, we ensure that scalar keys are handled correctly, fixing the bug in the function.
