## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, the bug seems to be related to incorrect handling of non-matching keys, particularly in the case of object types. The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'` in all cases, which leads to incorrect indexing behavior.

## Bug Explanation
In all the provided test cases, the key being used to index the Series object does not match any of the values in the Series index. This mismatch should raise a `KeyError` indicating that the key is not found in the index. However, due to the bug in the `_get_with` function, the function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'` instead of recognizing it as an object type, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly identifies the type of the key being used for indexing. We can leverage the available type checking methods and properly handle the case when a key is not found in the index.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the correct type checking methods and handling the case of non-matching keys properly, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle key indexing and pass the failing test cases.
