The bug in the `_get_with` function is that when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the function incorrectly treats it as a scalar and tries to access it directly using `self.loc[key]`, causing a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series by reindexing the Series with the key. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, it is properly handled by reindexing the Series with the key.

This fix should make the failing test cases pass successfully.
