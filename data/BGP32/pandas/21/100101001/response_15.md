The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs because the key_type is incorrectly identified as `'string'` for all cases, even when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. This incorrect identification causes the function to attempt reindexing instead of returning a KeyError as expected in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to properly identify the key_type based on the type of the key being passed. We can use the `is_list_like` function to distinguish between different types of keys. Additionally, we should handle the case where the key is not found in the index by raising a KeyError, as expected by the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
```

This corrected version properly identifies the key_type based on the type of key being passed and handles the case where the key is not found in the index by raising a KeyError. This modification aligns the function behavior with the expectations of the failing test provided.
