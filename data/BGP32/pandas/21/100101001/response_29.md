### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of input key types. The function fails to properly distinguish between different key types, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

1. In Case 1, 2, and 4, the function incorrectly identifies the key_type as `'string'` regardless of the actual input. This incorrect identification causes the function to attempt to handle the key as an integer indexer instead of a label-based indexer, leading to a KeyError.

2. In Case 3, even though the key type is correctly identified as a string, the function does not handle it according to the inferred type, resulting in a similar KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly identifies the type of the key and handles it accordingly. Specifically, we need to distinguish between integer and label-based indexing, ensuring that the key is treated correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle different types of keys and prevent the KeyError that was occurring before.
