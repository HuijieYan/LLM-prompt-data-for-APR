### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there are several issues in the code:
1. The check for `isinstance(key, tuple)` should come before the check for `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` as tuples can also be valid keys.
2. The `key_type` determination logic is flawed and always assigns `'string'` as the type, which is incorrect.
3. The logic for deciding whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`) based on `key_type` is flawed and needs to be adjusted.
4. The handling of keys of type `Index` and conversion to a list is problematic.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Reorder the `isinstance` checks to handle tuples first.
2. Correct the `key_type` determination logic by checking for specific types of keys.
3. Adjust the logic for selecting between `iloc` and `loc` based on the key type.
4. Ensure proper handling of keys of type `Index`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the mentioned issues in the function, it should now be able to handle different types of keys correctly and pass the failing test cases.
