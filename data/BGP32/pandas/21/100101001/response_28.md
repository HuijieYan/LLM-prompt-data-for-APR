### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for a Series object. It checks the type of the key and then performs different actions depending on the type. The bug seems to be related to the handling of keys that are not lists, arrays, or specific data structures like Index or Series. The key_type inference logic seems to be incorrect, leading to wrong behavior for certain keys.

### Bug Cause:
1. When encountering keys that are not recognized as arrays or lists, the function attempts to infer the `key_type` using the `lib.infer_dtype` function. This inference process somehow assigns the `key_type` as `'integer'` in some cases where keys are actually strings. This results in the function incorrectly making decisions based on the inferred type.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for all types of keys, especially when dealing with non-array, non-list type keys. We should modify the logic to handle string keys correctly and avoid mistakenly inferring them as integers.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):  # Fixed: Check if key is a scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and is_integer(key):  # Fixed: Correctly handle integer keys
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these corrections, the function should now correctly handle keys of different types and infer the key type accurately, leading to the correct behavior for the tests provided.
