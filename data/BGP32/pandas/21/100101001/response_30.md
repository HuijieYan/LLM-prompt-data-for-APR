The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to correctly handle the case where an invalid key is provided. Specifically, the issue stems from the `key_type` determination logic that fails to accurately identify the type of the key. This results in the function attempting to index the Series incorrectly, leading to a KeyError when accessing a non-existent index.

To address this bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the `key_type` and handling different types of keys appropriately. Based on the provided information and the failing test cases, we can revise the function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle various key types (np.ndarray, list, Series, Index) by directly using `self.loc[key]` without the need for additional type inference logic. This ensures that the correct indexing operation is performed, resolving the KeyError issue identified in the failing tests.

By making these adjustments, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different key types and pass the failing test cases.
