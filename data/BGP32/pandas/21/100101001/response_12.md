### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior and cause the failing tests.

1. The function incorrectly identifies the key_type as `'integer'` when the key is actually a string.
2. The function does not properly handle keys that are not recognized as list-like.
3. The function does not differentiate between different key types, leading to the wrong indexing method being used.
4. The function does not cover all possible key types, leading to inconsistencies in indexing behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to:
1. Correctly infer the key type and handle different types of keys appropriately.
2. Ensure that all possible key types are handled to provide consistent and accurate indexing behavior.
3. Update the logic to distinguish between different key types and choose the correct indexing method.
4. Ensure proper error handling and messaging for unsupported key types.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"Unsupported key type: {key_type}")

```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the issues with incorrect key type inference and handling will be addressed, and the function should now pass the failing tests.
