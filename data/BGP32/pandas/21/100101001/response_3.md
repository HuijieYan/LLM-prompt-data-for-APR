The bug in the `_get_with` function is that it incorrectly identifies the type of the `key` parameter and handles it inappropriately, leading to KeyError in the failing tests due to incorrect indexing.

The key issue lies in the initial check for `key_type == "integer"` and the subsequent handling of different key types. In the failing tests, the key is a list or ndarray containing a single element of dtype 'object' ('C'). However, the function wrongly infers the `key_type` as `'integer'` based on the content check. This leads to incorrect indexing logic and the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the key type and the corresponding indexing strategy based on the actual content of the `key`. We can utilize the content of the `key` to make an accurate inference about its type and then choose the appropriate indexing method.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        inferred_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if inferred_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now accurately determine the type of the `key` parameter based on its content, allowing it to perform the indexing correctly and pass the failing tests.
