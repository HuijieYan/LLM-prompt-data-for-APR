## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is used in the `Series` class for indexing operations.
- The function currently has a conditional block for handling different types of input keys such as slice, `ABCDataFrame`, tuple, non-list-like, etc.
- The bug is specifically related to how the function handles input keys that are list-like (e.g., `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`).
- The failing test tries to index a `Series` with a key that is a `pd.Index` object (which is list-like) containing values that are not present in the series.
- The bug causes the function to incorrectly expect the key to be present in the index, leading to a `KeyError` when the key is not found.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of `list` key indexers compared to other list-like indexers.
- The function treats a `list` key by trying to reindex it, expecting all elements to be present in the series index.
- This behavior is different from how other list-like indexers (e.g., `pd.Index`, `np.array`, `pd.Series`) are handled, leading to a `KeyError` when elements are not found in the series index.

## Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the handling of list-like keys to be consistent regardless of the specific type of the key (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
- Update the logic to handle list-like keys in a way that aligns with the behavior of other indexers to prevent the `KeyError` when elements are missing.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    # Check inferred type
    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to handle list-like keys consistently, regardless of their specific type, the corrected version should now correctly handle the provided failing test case and maintain consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
