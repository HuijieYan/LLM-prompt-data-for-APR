The issue with the `_get_with` function is that it doesn't handle list-like indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access the Series with a list-like key. The function mistakenly treats list-like indexers differently from other types of indexers.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently without raising an error. We should modify the function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case when key is a list
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle list-like indexers and other types of indexers consistently, ensuring that no `KeyError` is raised when accessing the Series with any type of key. This fix addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

After applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases and behave as expected with different types of indexers.
