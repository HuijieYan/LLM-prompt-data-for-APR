To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. Currently, the function fails to handle list-like keys properly, resulting in a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list.

The issue arises due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of key objects in the `_get_with` function. The function does not handle list-like keys correctly, leading to an error when attempting to index a Series with a list key.

To resolve this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to appropriately handle list-like keys. We should ensure that the correct key type is inferred and use the appropriate method for indexing the Series based on the key type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we check if the key is list-like and then proceed to index the Series based on the key type. By handling list-like keys correctly, the function will now properly handle indexing with list keys and avoid raising a `KeyError`.

This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistent treatment of list indexers. The function now handles list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers.
