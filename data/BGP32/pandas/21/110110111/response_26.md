After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, the issue stems from how the function `_get_with` treats different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function fails to handle the list indexer properly, resulting in a KeyError when accessing the index.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list indexers correctly. We can achieve this by ensuring that list indexers are processed consistently with other types of indexers such as ndarray or Index.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Ensure that all types of indexers are converted to list for consistent processing
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are converted to lists for consistent handling within the function. This should address the KeyError issue when accessing the index using a list indexer, as described in the failing test case.

After applying this correction, the function should pass the failing test case and align with the expected input/output values as described.
