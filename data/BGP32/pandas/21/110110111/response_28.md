To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the `key` parameter is a list-like object correctly. Currently, the function fails to process list-like keys, leading to a `KeyError`. We need to update the function to treat list-like keys consistently with other types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/series.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    """
    One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).
    
    Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object
    supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of
    methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical
    methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude
    missing data (currently represented as NaN).
    
    Operations between Series (+, -, /, *, **) align values based on their
    associated index values-- they need not be the same length. The result
    index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, Iterable, dict, or scalar value
        Contains data stored in Series.
    
        .. versionchanged:: 0.23.0
           If data is a dict, argument order is maintained for Python 3.6
           and later.
    
    index : array-like or Index (1d)
        Values must be hashable and have the same length as `data`.
        Non-unique index values are allowed. Will default to
        RangeIndex (0, 1, 2, ..., n) if not provided. If both a dict and index
        sequence are used, the index will override the keys found in the
        dict.
    dtype : str, numpy.dtype, or ExtensionDtype, optional
        Data type for the output Series. If not specified, this will be
        inferred from `data`.
        See the :ref:`user guide <basics.dtypes>` for more usages.
    name : str, optional
        The name to give to the Series.
    copy : bool, default False
        Copy input data.
    """

    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
            #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
            # Handle list-like or Index keys
            return self.loc[key]
        
        else:
            key = list(key)
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]

            return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles list-like keys by processing them with the `self.loc[key]` method. This fix ensures that the function can handle list-like keys consistently with other types of keys, resolving the `KeyError` issue.

By updating the `_get_with` function with the provided corrections, it should pass the failing test case mentioned earlier and align with the expected input/output variable values.
