## Analysis
1. **Buggy Function**: The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers. However, it currently fails to handle the case when the indexer is a list-like object.
   
2. **Test Function**: The `test_getitem_no_matches` test function aims to test how the Series class handles indexing with different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series). It expects a KeyError to be raised when there are no matches in the index.

3. **Issue**: The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in indexing behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when a list indexer is used.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when dealing with a list-like key. The function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError being raised, which results in the failing test cases.

The function mistakenly treats the key as a scalar and tries to access it using `.loc`, which causes the KeyError. The issue on GitHub points out this inconsistency in behavior when using different indexer types.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
- Modify the function to identify list-like indexers correctly and handle them appropriately.
- Check if the key is a list-like object and handle it differently than scalar keys.
- Ensure that the function can handle list-like indexers without raising a KeyError.

## Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(isinstance(k, (str, int, np.integer)) for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks for list-like indexers and handles them by using `.loc` with multiple keys correctly. It ensures that the function behavior is consistent for different types of indexers.
