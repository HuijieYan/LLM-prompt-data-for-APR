## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle different types of input keys, including slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, extension arrays, series, and indexes. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like keys.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when a key that is not present in the series index is used to index the series.
3. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when a list-like key is used, while other types of keys are handled differently. The function is incorrectly handling the list-like key case, leading to the test failure.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys by reindexing based on the key values.
5. We will update the function to properly handle list-like keys in order to pass the failing test and address the issue raised on GitHub.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle list-like keys by using the `loc` indexer for them. This change will ensure that the function behaves consistently across different types of keys and passes the failing test scenario.
