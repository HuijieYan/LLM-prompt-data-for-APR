## Identified Bug
The issue arises from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class. When a list-like key is passed to this function, it is incorrectly handled, leading to an error during indexing. The current implementation does not properly handle list indexers, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to array-like indexers.

The bug can be specifically traced back to the following block of code within the function:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
In this block, when the `key` parameter is not recognized as list-like (such as a scalar), it attempts to index using `self.loc[key]`, which leads to an error in scenarios where a list indexer is used.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. We should ensure that list indexers are properly dealt with, aligning the behavior with how array-like indexers are handled.

## Corrected Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the handling of list-like keys is now consistent with array-like keys, ensuring that list indexers are processed correctly without causing errors.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
