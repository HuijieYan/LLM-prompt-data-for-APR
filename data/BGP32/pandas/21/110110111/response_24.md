### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of keys during indexing.
2. The failing test is testing the behavior when indexing with a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series object.
3. The error occurs when indexing with a list, causing a KeyError due to mismatched index values.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles different types of keys and the corresponding error handling for index mismatches.
5. The expected behavior is to properly handle indexing with different types of keys without raising a KeyError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `key` is provided as a list, the implementation fails to properly handle the indexing operation, leading to a KeyError due to mismatched index values.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the implementation to properly handle the case when `key` is a list by ensuring that the indexing operation aligns correctly with the index labels.
2. Implement a consistent behavior for indexing with different types of keys to avoid KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the function should now properly handle different types of keys during indexing, avoiding the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test cases. This corrected version aims to align the index values correctly with the keys being used for indexing.
