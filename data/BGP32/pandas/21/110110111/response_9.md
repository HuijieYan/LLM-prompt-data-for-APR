The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is causing an issue when a list indexer is used, as observed in the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`. The function incorrectly handles different types of indexers, resulting in the `KeyError` exception not being raised for certain cases.

### Issue Analysis:
- **Buggy Function**: The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class has conditional checks for different types of indexers, but the implementation for a list indexer is causing the problem.
- **Failing Test**: The failing test is trying to access an element from the `Series` using a list indexer, but the incorrect handling is leading to the `KeyError` exception not being raised.
- **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the `KeyError` was not raised as expected, pointing to the problem with how list indexers are processed.
- **Expected Input/Output**: The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` when trying to access a non-existent key in the `Series`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function fails to correctly handle list indexers when accessing elements from the `Series`.
- The mixture of checks for different types of indexers results in inconsistent behavior, leading to the incorrect flow for list indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists.
- Ensure that a `KeyError` is raised consistently when trying to access non-existent keys in the `Series`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer" and self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the changes mentioned above, the corrected function ensures consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list indexers. This should resolve the issue observed in the failing test case and align the function's behavior with the expected output.
