The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled. When a list indexer is passed, an error occurs as the function attempts to reindex the Series with the list key. To fix this bug, we need to handle list indexers in a similar manner to other types of indexers.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function now checks if the key is a list-like object or an instance of a Series before directly using `self.loc[key]` to access the values. This change ensures consistency in handling different types of indexers and resolves the issue with list indexers raised on GitHub.
