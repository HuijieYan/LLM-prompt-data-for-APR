## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various array-like objects.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the function when using indexers like lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. The error message indicates that the `KeyError` exception is not being raised as expected when using a list as an indexer, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.
4. The expected input/output values reveal that the `key_type` should be determined as `'string'` in all cases where a string key is involved.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is likely caused by the incomplete handling of the indexer type check for lists. When `key` is checked for being list-like, it tries to convert it to a list using `list(key)`, which could lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with an indexer like a list of objects. This results in the incorrect treatment of the index as a list and failing to raise the `KeyError` appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type checks are consistent and correctly identify when an indexer is a list. Instead of converting the key to a list regardless of its type, we can check if the key is a list and handle it separately to maintain consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Bug-free Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition to check for list-like objects and scalars separately, the correct behavior is maintained for different types of indexers, including lists. This fix should address the inconsistent handling of key types and ensure that the `KeyError` exception is raised when necessary.
