## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs (slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list-like scalar, list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index).
2. The bug occurs when the input key is a list type. The function fails to properly handle the list key input.
3. The failing test case aims to test the behavior of the function when trying to access a key that does not exist in the series index. It expects a `KeyError` to be raised but the current implementation does not raise it for list-like keys.
4. To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle list-like keys and raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the series index.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle list-like keys, leading to inconsistent behavior when accessing non-existent keys in the series index.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the section of the function that handles non-list-like indexers to properly handle list-like keys. We should check if the provided key is not in the series index and raise a `KeyError` in that case.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key in self.index:
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By making the necessary modifications to correctly handle list-like keys and raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the series index, this corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
