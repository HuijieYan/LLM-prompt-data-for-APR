## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when indexing with an object that doesn't exist in the Series, expecting a `KeyError`.
3. The error occurs when the input key is converted to a list and passed into the function.
4. The test parameters involve different types of key input: list, ndarray, Index, and Series.
5. The main issue is related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other indexers in the function.

## Bug Cause:
1. When passing a key that doesn't exist in the Series as a list, the function tries to reindex with that key, leading to a `KeyError`.
2. The code doesn't handle list-like key input correctly, and the different behavior is causing inconsistency and failing tests.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of input keys by adapting the handling of list-like keys to be in line with other indexers.
2. Modify the logic to handle list-like key inputs appropriately to prevent KeyError when the key doesn't exist in the Series.

## Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list-like keys correctly, the corrected function ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the KeyError issue with the failing test cases.
