To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to address the issue where using a list-like key as an indexer does not behave consistently with other types of indexers. 

The root cause of the bug is that when a list-like key is passed, the function does not handle it properly, leading to a `KeyError`. This inconsistency causes confusion and unexpected behavior for users.

To address this issue, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys correctly. We can achieve this by ensuring that a list-like key is properly converted to an index object before further processing.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version now properly handles list-like keys by converting them to an index object using `ensure_index` before processing. This ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolves the `KeyError` issue reported in the failing test.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test and behave as expected for list-like keys.
