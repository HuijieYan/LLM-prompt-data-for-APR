## Analyzing the Buggy Function and Failing Test

### Buggy Function
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series` object. The function checks the type of key and processes it accordingly. However, there is an issue with how it handles list-like keys.

### Failing Test
The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to test the behavior of indexing a Series object with a key that does not match any values in the index. The test uses various types of keys (list, numpy array, Index, Series) to check for consistent behavior.

### Error Message
The error message indicates that the test did not raise a `KeyError` as expected when using `ser[key]` with a list-like key. This inconsistency in behavior is noted in the GitHub issue associated with the bug.

### Expected Input/Output Values
For the failing test, the expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` when trying to index the Series with a key that is not present in the index. The `Series` object should handle list-like keys consistently with other types of keys.

### GitHub Issue
The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a `Series` with different types of keys, specifically when using a list-like key. The aim is to make the behavior consistent across all types of keys.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Identify the code block responsible for handling list-like keys and ensure it aligns with the behavior for other types of keys.
2. Modify the code to raise a `KeyError` when indexing with a list-like key that does not exist in the index.
3. Make sure the function performs consistent error handling for all types of keys to address the issue raised in the GitHub report.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with unsupported type, use a valid key type."
            )
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            if all(k in self.index for k in key):
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure consistent handling of list-like keys when indexing a `Series` object. This correction should address the issue raised in the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
