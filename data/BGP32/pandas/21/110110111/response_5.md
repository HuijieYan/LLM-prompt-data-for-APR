To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the conditional checks for different types of key input parameters. The bug occurs when trying to access a value from the Series using a list-like key, resulting in a KeyError.

The issue arises because when the key is of type list, the function tries to convert it to a list again, causing an error. We need to handle the list case differently from other types of keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the case of a list-like key separately by directly returning `self.loc[key]` when the key is of type list. This modification ensures that the function works correctly and passes the failing test case.

By making this change, we align the behavior of list indexers with array-like indexers, as requested in the GitHub issue. This modification resolves the issue of KeyError being raised when using a list key to access a value from the Series.
