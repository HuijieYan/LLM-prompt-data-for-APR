### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series object. However, the bug seems to arise when the key type is not correctly identified, leading to an incorrect indexing operation and resulting in a `KeyError` in the failing test cases.

The problematic part of the code seems to be the identification of the `key_type` based on the input key. This identification is critical for determining whether to use positional indexing (iloc) or label-based indexing (loc) in the following steps.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the key type is not correctly identified during the indexing process. This leads to the wrong approach being taken for indexing, which results in a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index. The issue lies in the determination of the `key_type` based on the input key, which is crucial for selecting the appropriate indexing method.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified, so that the correct indexing operation (loc or iloc) can be selected based on the key type. We can improve the identification of the key type to handle different types of keys correctly.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Identify the key type
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if hasattr(key, "inferred_type"):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Handle indexing based on the key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes improvements in identifying the key type and using the correct indexing method accordingly. It ensures that the function properly handles different types of keys and performs the indexing operation accurately.
