### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the bug seems to be related to how it handles the key that is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The error message indicates that the function fails to return a KeyError when the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function fails to correctly handle the key when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. It should raise a KeyError when the key is not present in the index, but it fails to do so.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code block that handles list, ndarray, Index, or Series keys. We should add a check to ensure that the key is present in the index. If not present, we should raise a KeyError.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not self.index.isin(key).all():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check to validate that all elements of the key are present in the index. If not, it raises a KeyError with an appropriate error message.
