### Analysis:
- The `Series` class has a method `_get_with` that is intended to handle various types of `key` inputs to retrieve values.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that there is an issue when indexing with a key that is not found in the series index, resulting in a `KeyError`.
- The buggy function seems to incorrectly handle the different types of `key` inputs and does not properly distinguish between them, leading to the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of different types of `key` inputs in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when indexing with a key that is not found in the series index, the function fails to raise a `KeyError` as expected. This bug can be attributed to the improper type-checking logic and conditional statements for different key types.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Improve the type-checking mechanism to correctly identify the type of the `key` input.
2. Ensure that the function raises a `KeyError` when trying to access a key not present in the series index.
3. Verify that the function correctly handles different types of `key` inputs according to the pandas API specifications.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Raise KeyError if key is not found in the index
    if not self.index.isin(key).any():
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    # If key is a basic Python type, directly look up the value
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # For list-like keys, handle duplication and reindexing
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Justification for the Correction:
1. The corrected version includes a check to raise a `KeyError` when the `key` is not found in the series index, ensuring that the behavior aligns with the test expectation.
2. The corrected version corrects the handling of different types of keys, providing appropriate processing based on the key type.
3. The correction ensures that the `_get_with` function conforms to pandas API standards and properly handles various key inputs.
