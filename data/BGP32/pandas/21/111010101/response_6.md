### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a Series.
2. The failing tests are related to indexing a Series with various types such as lists, ndarrays, Indexes, and other Series.
3. The error message is a `KeyError`, indicating that certain keys are not found in the Series index.
4. The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of different key types within the function.
5. The expected input/output values vary based on the type of key being passed to the function.
  
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Ensure that the function properly handles the different types of keys that can be passed to it for indexing.
2. Adjust the logic for determining the type of key and how it should be indexed with respect to the Series index.
3. Update the function to handle each key type correctly to avoid the `KeyError` during indexing.
4. Make sure that the function follows the expected behavior based on the key type being used for indexing.
  
### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check type and handle accordingly
    if isinstance(key, (Index, pd.Series)):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```
  
By updating the `_get_with` function with the corrected logic to handle different key types appropriately, the function should now pass the failing tests and return the expected output values for each case.
