### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is expected to handle different types of input keys (such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, etc.) and return the corresponding values from the Series object.
2. The failing test cases involve passing different types of keys to the Series object and expecting KeyError to be raised when there is no matching index present in the Series object.
3. The bug occurs because the logic for handling non-list-like keys is incomplete. It tries to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]` without checking if it is a valid index or not.
4. To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic for handling non-list-like keys and ensure that KeyError is raised when there is no match.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is an instance of a valid index (list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index) before trying to access it directly.
2. If the key is not a valid index type, raise a KeyError to indicate that the key is not found in the Series object.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")  # Raise KeyError if key is not list-like

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")  # Raise KeyError for invalid index type

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")  # Raise KeyError if key is not handled by any condition
```

By implementing the above changes in the `_get_with` function, it should now correctly handle different types of keys and raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the Series object.
