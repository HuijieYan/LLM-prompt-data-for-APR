### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type.
3. The error message indicates that the function is not handling the key correctly when it is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.
4. The bug could be related to the way the function is handling different types of keys, especially in the cases where the key is expected to be a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.
5. The function should correctly handle these different types of keys and perform the indexing appropriately.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the function encounters a list, numpy array, Index, or Series as the key. The function currently uses `key = list(key)` for these cases, which might not handle the key correctly. It might convert the key into a list but not index the Series appropriately.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the type of the key and directly index the Series if the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.
2. Handle the indexing of the Series appropriately for these key types.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly indexing the Series using `self.loc[key]` for list, numpy array, Index, or Series keys, the corrected version should handle these cases correctly and pass the failing test cases.
