### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. The function is intended to retrieve values from the Series based on the provided key. However, the bug arises when the input key is of type `Index`. In this case, the function incorrectly infers the type of the key as `integer` instead of handling it as an `Index` type. This mistake leads to the wrong path being chosen in the subsequent logic flow, resulting in an incorrect index operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is of type `Index`, it is correctly handled as an `Index` type and not inferred as an `integer` type. This will ensure that the function follows the correct path based on the actual type of the key.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the case when the key is of type `Index` and ensures that it is processed as such, resolving the bug and allowing the function to produce the expected output for all test cases.
