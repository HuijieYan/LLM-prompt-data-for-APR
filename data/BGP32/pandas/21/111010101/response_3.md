### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` takes a key as input and performs various checks based on the type of the key.
2. The error occurs when the input `key` is not recognized as a list-like object and the function tries to access the `key` using `.loc[key]`.
3. The error message indicates a `KeyError`, which means that the key is not present in the index.
4. The bug arises from incorrect handling of non-list-like keys, leading to the `KeyError`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of non-list-like keys to properly index the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Change the block handling non-list-like keys to correctly process the key when it is not list-like.
- Use proper conditional statements to ensure the key is indexed based on its type and contents.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalar keys correctly
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
            # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
            #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
            if key_type == "integer":
                # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
                #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above corrections, the function should now correctly index keys that are not list-like objects and avoid the `KeyError` that was previously occurring.
