### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others.
2. The failing tests are trying to access elements in a Series using different types of keys, such as lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is not being raised when it is expected, showing a discrepancy in handling the key types.
4. The bug seems to occur when determining the `key_type` based on the type of key provided.

### Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the determination of the `key_type` based on the type of the key provided. The incorrect handling of key types is leading to the wrong path being taken in the logic flow, causing the wrong behavior and failing the tests. The way `key_type` is inferred and used in decision-making is causing the mismatch.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for inferring the `key_type` based on the type of the key. We need to ensure that the correct type inference is done to align with the expected behavior for different key types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a modified logic for inferring the `key_type` based on the type of the key, ensuring that the correct path is taken for different key types.
