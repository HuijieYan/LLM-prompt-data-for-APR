### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle various types of key inputs for indexing the `Series`. However, there seems to be an issue with how it handles the key input, leading to a `KeyError` in the failing test cases. The expected behavior is to correctly select the values from the `Series` based on the key provided.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the key is of type `ndarray` or `Index`, as those are not properly handled in the `_get_with` function. The key is converted to a `list` or an `Index` instance during processing, which results in a mismatch with the original key type provided, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the type of the key input and process it accordingly without converting it to an incompatible type.
2. Handle `ndarray` and `Index` types separately to prevent the conversion mismatch.
3. Ensure that the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the key type.
4. Update the path for reindexing operations if needed to address the issue.

### Corrected Code

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle ndarrays
    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim == 1:
        key = key.flatten()

    # Handle Index instances separately
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, the `_get_with` function should now appropriately handle different types of key inputs without causing a `KeyError` in the failing test cases.
