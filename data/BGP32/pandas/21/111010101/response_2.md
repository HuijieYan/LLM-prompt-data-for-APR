### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. Based on the error messages provided, it seems that the bug lies in how the key is handled within the function causing a `KeyError` to be raised. The expected behavior is to correctly index the Series object based on the type of key provided.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of different key types inside the `_get_with` function. In all cases where the key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function is trying to access the `loc` attribute of the Series object directly, leading to a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the index.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling different key types. Specifically:
1. If the key is not a recognized list-like object, we should fall back to using `iloc` instead of `loc`, assuming the index is position-based.
2. If the key is recognized as type `Index`, we should directly use `loc` on that key.
3. If the key is a list, we may need to handle duplicate indexing correctly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the errors related to the failing test cases should be resolved, and the function should now handle different key types accurately while indexing the Series object.
