### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` takes a key as input and performs different operations based on the type of the key.
2. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised when indexing the Series with a key that does not exist in the index.
3. The bug seems to be related to the comparison and handling of different key types within the function.
4. The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the function correctly handles the key type and appropriately raises a `KeyError` when needed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the key type at the beginning of the function and handle each type accordingly.
2. If the key is not found in the index, raise a `KeyError` as expected.
3. Correctly infer the `key_type` based on the key input.
4. Refactor the function to accurately determine whether to use positional indexing or label-based indexing.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame) or isinstance(key, Series):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported."
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Scalars or unsupported types
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index.")

    key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index.")
```

The corrected version of the function handles different key types appropriately and raises a `KeyError` when a key is not found in the index. This version should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
