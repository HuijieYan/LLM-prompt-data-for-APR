### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for returning values based on different types of `key`.
2. The failing tests are checking for proper handling of keys that are not present in the index, resulting in a `KeyError`.
3. The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of different types of `key` inputs in the buggy function `_get_with`.
4. The buggy function is not correctly handling the case when `key` is a subclass of `Index`, leading to a KeyError.
5. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError when the `key` is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly handle different types of `key` inputs.
2. Specifically, ensure that when `key` is a subclass of `Index`, it is handled appropriately to prevent the KeyError.
3. Add a check to validate if the key is present in the index before attempting to fetch the value.
4. Refactor the code to handle different types of keys systematically to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if key.empty:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle different types of `key` inputs properly and pass the failing tests with the expected behavior.
