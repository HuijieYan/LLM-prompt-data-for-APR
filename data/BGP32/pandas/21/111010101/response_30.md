### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test is related to indexing a Series object with a key that is not present in the index, resulting in a `KeyError`.
3. The bug in the function seems to be related to the way it handles different types of keys, especially when the key type is not recognized correctly.
4. The bug may lie in the logic that determines the `key_type` for the given key and decides whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`).

### Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the key type when indexing a Series object. The function fails to select the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) based on the type of key provided. This leads to a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that is not present in the index.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correctly identify the key type being used for indexing.
2. Use the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) based on the key type.
3. Ensure that the function handles different types of keys correctly and prevents `KeyError` exceptions when indexing.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the function explicitly checks for both "integer" and "string" key types and uses either `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type. This should prevent the `KeyError` issue when indexing with keys that are not present in the index.
