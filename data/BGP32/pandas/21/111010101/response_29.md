### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys passed to the Series. It first checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or some other type like a list or ndarray.
2. The bug occurs when the key is an Index object. The code incorrectly tries to access the `key.inferred_type` attribute, which does not exist, leading to a KeyError when trying to use this attribute later in the code.
3. The bug causes the function to fail when an Index object is passed as the key parameter due to the incorrect handling of the key type conversion.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct approach is taken when dealing with an Index object as the key parameter.

### Proposed Fix
We need to modify the function to properly handle Index objects as keys by checking the object type and inferring the dtype directly from the key. We should not attempt to access the nonexistent `inferred_type` attribute.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle Index objects as keys and pass the failing test cases.
