### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` values, such as slices, dataframes, tuples, and list-like objects. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the `key_type` variable based on the type of `key`. The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to retrieve values from the Series using a different type of `key`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the function encounters a key of type `Index`, which should lead to inferring the key type as a `"string"`. However, due to incorrect handling of the `Index` type, the `key_type` variable does not get updated correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to reindex or locate the key value in the Series.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of `key`. We should handle the `Index` type properly to update the `key_type` as a `"string"` when the `key` type is `Index`. Additionally, we should ensure that the function can handle the different types of keys correctly to prevent any unexpected errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This correction includes handling scalar keys using `is_scalar()` function, ensuring that the `key` is a valid index using `ensure_index()`, and correctly inferring the `key_type` based on the type of `key`.
