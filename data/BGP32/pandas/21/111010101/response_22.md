### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing Series objects.
2. The buggy function checks the type of the key and processes it accordingly. It raises a `TypeError` if the key is of type `ABCDataFrame`, which is expected behavior.
3. The failing test cases are testing different types of keys like list, ndarray, Index, and Series, and expecting a `KeyError` to be raised.
4. The bug is likely to be related to the processing of the key types and how it interacts with the indexing flow in the function.
5. The function should correctly handle the indexing operation based on the type of the key and the existing index of the Series.

### Bug Cause
The bug likely stems from how the function `_get_with` is treating different types of keys for indexing. The bug might relate to how the function interacts with the index of the Series object, leading to a failure in certain test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles different types of keys appropriately based on the indexing requirements of the Series. We should address the key types like ndarray, Index, and Series for proper indexing and error handling.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the expected input/output values and bug analysis:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check for different types of keys and handle them accordingly
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    if is_object_dtype(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle the different key types properly and align with the expected input/output values for all test cases. It ensures that the function behaves as intended for indexing Series objects.
