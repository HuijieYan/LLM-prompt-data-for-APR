### Bug analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to improper handling of the key when it is a Pandas Index type. The function incorrectly tries to access the `inferred_type` attribute directly from the `key`, causing a KeyError to be raised during the test cases because the `inferred_type` attribute does not exist for Pandas Index objects.

### Bug location
The bug is located in the following snippet of code:
```python
if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```

### Bug explanation
- When the key is of type `Index`, the buggy code tries to access the `inferred_type` attribute directly from the key. However, Pandas Index objects do not have an `inferred_type` attribute, leading to a KeyError.
- The bug causes a KeyError because it tries to access a non-existing attribute on an Index object.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the code to correctly handle Index objects. We should infer the dtype of the key if it is not an Index object. If it is an Index object, we should consider an alternative approach to determine the key_type.

### Corrected version of the _get_with function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle Index objects and infer the dtype of the key appropriately. The corrected function should now pass the failing test cases and return the expected outputs.
