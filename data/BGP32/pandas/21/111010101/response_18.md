### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for indexing a Series object with various types of keys, such as a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, a list, an ndarray, an ExtensionArray, a Series, or an Index.
2. The bug occurs when attempting to index the Series object with a key that is not recognized by the current implementation. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access an element in the Series.
3. The function contains multiple conditional checks to determine the key type and handle the indexing appropriately. The bug likely originates from the branching logic and incorrect handling of certain key types.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all possible key types are correctly handled and indexing operations are performed accordingly.
5. The corrected version of the `_get_with(key)` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ['string', 'datetime', 'categorical', 'object']:
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == 'integer':
            if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case where key is not recognized
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By fixing the conditional branches and ensuring proper handling of different key types, the corrected version of the function should now provide the expected behavior for indexing a Series object with various types of keys.
