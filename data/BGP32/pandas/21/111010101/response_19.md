### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series. It checks the type of the key and then processes it accordingly.
2. The error message indicates that the test is expecting a `KeyError` to be raised during indexing, but it is not being raised, leading to test failure.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key types in the function.
4. The function should properly handle the key types to ensure that the correct indexing behavior is applied.
5. The key types need to be properly identified and processed to ensure the correct behavior of indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the key type correctly and apply the corresponding indexing behavior.
2. Update the conditional statements to handle different key types appropriately.
3. Ensure that the index is properly checked for the presence of the key before attempting to access it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
        
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)
        
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() and not is_bool(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, MultiIndex):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to correctly identify and handle different key types, the corrected version should now pass the failing test cases and ensure the expected input/output values are satisfied.
