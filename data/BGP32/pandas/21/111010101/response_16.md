### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. It checks the type of the key and then performs specific actions based on the type. The error message in the failing test indicates that the function is not correctly handling the case when the key type is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

The bug is likely in the part of the function that handles these types of keys. The key is being converted to a list without checking if it's already a list or Index type, which is causing the issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when the key is not recognized as list-like, the function tries to convert it to a list unconditionally. This leads to incorrect handling of Index type keys, resulting in a KeyError during indexing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic for handling keys that are not list-like. If the key is an Index type, it should not be converted to a list. Instead, the function should interpret Index type keys correctly for indexing the Series.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles Index type keys correctly without unnecessarily converting them to lists, avoiding the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.
