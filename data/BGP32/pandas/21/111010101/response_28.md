### Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test

1. The buggy function `_get_with` takes a key as input and performs different operations based on the type of the key.
2. The error messages from the failing test indicate that a `KeyError` is not being raised when accessing the Series with certain types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series).
3. The expected behavior is for a `KeyError` to be raised when the key is not found in the Series index.
4. The failing test cases cover various input types for the key parameter, expecting a `KeyError` if the key is not present in the Series index.

### Bug in the function
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the handling of different key types. The function does not properly handle cases where the key is not found in the Series index, resulting in the incorrect behavior observed in the failing tests.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if the key exists in the Series index before performing any operations.
2. If the key is not found in the index, raise a `KeyError`.
3. Ensure consistent error handling for different key types to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
           raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"{[k for k in key if k not in self.index]} not found in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the check for the existence of each key in the Series index and raising a `KeyError` if the key is not found, the corrected function will provide the expected behavior for the failing test cases.
