### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug seems to be related to the handling of key types in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. It appears that the function incorrectly determines a key type as `'string'`, which leads to a failure in the test cases where an index is not found in the Series.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled within the function. Specifically, we should update the logic for determining the key type and provide appropriate handling based on the type of the key.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now correctly handle different types of keys passed to it and address the bug that caused the failing tests.
