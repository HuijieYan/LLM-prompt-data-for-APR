### Analysis
The `_get_with` function is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug occurs when the key is of type `Index`. When the key is an instance of `Index`, the inferred type is incorrectly identified as `'integer'`, leading to an incorrect branch in the code flow. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised instead of returning the appropriate result.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly inferring the type of the key when it is an instance of `Index`. This leads to the function taking the wrong code path and raising a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type of the key is correctly identified when it is an instance of `Index`. By correctly inferring the type, we can ensure that the function takes the appropriate code path and returns the expected result without raising a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = getattr(key, "inferred_type", None)  # Correctly infer the key type for an Index
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including the correct handling for `Index` objects and ensuring the `key_type` is correctly inferred, the corrected function should now return the expected results without raising a `KeyError`.
