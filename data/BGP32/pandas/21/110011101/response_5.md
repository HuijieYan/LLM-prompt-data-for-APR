### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type when it is not recognized as a list-like object, causing unexpected behavior and ultimately leading to a KeyError in the test cases.

When the key is not list-like, the function incorrectly tries to access the `loc` attribute with the key as an index. This results in a KeyError because the key is not present in the index of the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is not list-like, we handle it appropriately by returning the expected value without trying to access it as an index.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self._get_value(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes the addition of `_get_value` to handle non-list-like keys appropriately and eliminate the KeyError issue. Now the function should properly handle different key types and behavior as expected in the failing test cases.
