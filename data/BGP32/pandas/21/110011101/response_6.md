### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when attempting to access an index that does not exist in the Series. This bug occurs because when a non-list-like key is passed to the function, it falls into the `else` block where the key is treated as a label-based indexer and passed to `self.loc[key]`. This results in a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that non-list-like keys are handled correctly. We can modify the function to first check if the key is present in the index before attempting to access it directly. If the key is not found, we can raise a `KeyError` with an appropriate message.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple): 
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected function, we first check if the key is in the index before attempting to access it, and raise a `KeyError` with a message if it is not found. This ensures that the function behaves correctly when non-list-like keys are provided.
