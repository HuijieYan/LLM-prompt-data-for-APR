### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of keys when indexing a Series object. However, the bug occurs when dealing with a key that is not recognized correctly, leading to an incorrect return value and consequently causing the failing tests.

The issue arises when detecting the type of the key. The function tries to infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`, but this method may not always accurately determine the key type. This can result in the function treating the key incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly infers the key type, leading to a wrong path being taken within the function. This results in the function attempting to reindex with an incorrect key, causing the tests to fail with a KeyError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the key type is correctly identified before proceeding with the indexing operation. We can refine the logic for determining the key type to handle various key types properly. Additionally, we can simplify the key type detection to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential errors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):  # Check if key is a scalar
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = 'other'  # Defaulting to 'other' for non-integer and non-string key types

        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == 'string':  # Assuming string keys
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)  # Default handling for all other cases
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for scalar keys and string keys, defaulting to reindexing for other cases. This approach improves the robustness of the function and ensures correct handling of various key types.
