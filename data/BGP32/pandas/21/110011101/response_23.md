### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when handling certain types of keys. Specifically, the issue arises when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, causing unexpected behavior in the function. This leads to a `KeyError` being raised in the failing test.

In the buggy function, the conditional block that checks if the key is not list-like should ideally return the result of `self.loc[key]`, but instead, it erroneously tries to directly index the Series without proper handling for non-list-like keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when the key is not recognized as list-like, we fall back to using the `loc` attribute to correctly retrieve the values from the Series. This will prevent the `KeyError` from being raised and ensure proper indexing behavior.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correctly using `self.loc[key]` when the key is not recognized as list-like, we ensure that the function will handle all types of keys appropriately and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring in the failing tests.
