### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when trying to access an element from the Series using a key that is not found in the index. The function mistakenly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` instead of recognizing it as a type that indicates the key is not present in the index.

### Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test cases, the key being used to access an element in the Series is not present in the index.
2. The buggy function `_get_with` incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'`.
3. This incorrect inference leads to improper logic execution within the function, which results in a failure to raise a `KeyError` when accessing a non-existent key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correctly identify cases where the key does not exist in the index and raise a `KeyError` as expected. We should modify the logic in the function to handle this scenario appropriately.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if self.index.isin(key).all():  # Check if all keys are present in the index
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the check to ensure all keys are present in the index before using `self.loc[key]`, we prevent the logic error that led to the bug. This correction should ensure that the function raises a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index.
