### Bug Explanation

The bug is caused by the incorrect check for the key type within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. The function incorrectly checks for the key type using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)` and compares it with 'integer' to decide whether to treat the key as a positional indexer or a label-based indexer. However, the `lib.infer_dtype` function does not return 'integer' for integer keys, leading to the incorrect decision about how to index the Series. This results in a KeyError when accessing elements that should be available in the Series.

### Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic used to determine the key type and how to index the Series based on that type. We can replace the check for `key_type == "integer"` with a more reliable approach to identify integer keys. One common way to check if a key is an integer is by explicitly checking if it is an integer using the `isinstance()` function.

### Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index, pd.Index)):
        if all(isinstance(k, int) for k in key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking if the key is an integer before deciding whether to use `iloc` or `loc`, the corrected function will handle integer keys correctly and avoid the KeyError that was occurring before. This fix ensures that the Series can be indexed properly with keys of different types.
