### Analysis
1. The function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of `key` inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others, and return the appropriate values from the Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `key` input parameters, leading to a misclassification of the key type.
3. The error messages indicate that the key type is not recognized correctly, resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and that the corresponding action is taken.
5. The bug is likely in the classification and handling of the key type inside the function.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the section where the key type is determined and the corresponding action is taken. We will ensure that the key type is correctly identified and the appropriate retrieval method (`.loc` or `.iloc`) is used based on the key type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif key_type == "boolean":
            # The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
            raise NotImplementedError("Boolean type not supported yet.")

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should address the misclassification of the key type and handle the key correctly based on its type. It should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output for different types of key inputs.
