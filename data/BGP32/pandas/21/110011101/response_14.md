### Analysis
1. The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing. It checks if the key is a slice, a DataFrame, a tuple, or a list-like object, and then performs operations accordingly.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles certain key types, specifically when the key is a list, numpy array, Index, or Series.
3. The error messages indicate that a KeyError is not being raised as expected when certain key types are used for indexing. This suggests that the function is not properly handling these key types.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different key types and raises a KeyError when necessary.
5. I will modify the function to properly handle the different key types and ensure that the KeyError is raised when needed.

### Updated Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame) or isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, Series)):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle DataFrame as a key and considering different key types for indexing, the bug should be fixed. This updated function should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected output.
