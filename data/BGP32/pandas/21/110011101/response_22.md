### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The function contains several if-elif conditions to identify the type of key and perform the appropriate operation. However, the bug seems to be related to the handling of certain key types, especially when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series object.

From the failing test cases, it appears that the function is not correctly identifying the key types, leading to a KeyError when trying to index the Series object with those keys. The key_type variable is incorrectly identified as 'string' in all cases, which is not an acceptable type in the context of indexing.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the key type in the `_get_with` function. The key_type should reflect the actual type of the key being passed, such as 'index', 'integer', or 'boolean', to determine whether to use `loc` or `iloc` for indexing.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key_type is correctly identified based on the type of the key being passed. We should also handle the different key types (list, ndarray, Index, Series) appropriately for indexing the Series object.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated implementation ensures that the key is converted into an Index object if it's not already in that format. It also correctly infers the key_type based on the type of key being passed. By handling the key types consistently within the function, we should be able to address the KeyError issues seen in the failing test cases.
