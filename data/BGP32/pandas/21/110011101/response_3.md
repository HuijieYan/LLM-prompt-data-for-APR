The bug in the `_get_with` function is due to incorrect handling of the key input parameter types, leading to the KeyError during the tests. Based on the provided information, we can see that the key_type is erroneously identified as `'string'`, which is incorrect for the given input types, causing the function to return incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the handling of key types, especially when key is a list-like object. We should ensure that the key is correctly processed based on its type to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Series)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or another Series is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)  # Ensure key is a list
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures proper handling of different key types and should address the KeyError issue during the tests.
