The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of key types, which leads to the KeyError during indexing. In the provided cases, the key is assumed to be a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, but the function fails to properly handle the key's type.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly determines the key type and handles each case appropriately. We can achieve this by updating the key_type detection logic and the corresponding key handling conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)) or is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

This corrected version includes proper type checking and handling for the key input, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for the provided cases and resolves the issue causing the KeyError during the failing tests.
