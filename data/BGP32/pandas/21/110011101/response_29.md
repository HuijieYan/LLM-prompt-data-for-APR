## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the input `key` parameter. The function is designed to handle different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list) when indexing a Series. However, when dealing with a key that is a list-like object, the function fails to correctly determine whether it should be treated as a positional indexer (using `iloc`) or a label-based indexer (using `loc`). This leads to a KeyError being raised when trying to access the key in the Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle list-like keys by correctly determining whether they should be treated as positional or label-based indexers. This can be achieved by checking the type of the key and then using either `loc` or `iloc` accordingly.

## Corrected Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version of the function now properly handles list-like keys by checking their type and deciding whether to use `loc` or `iloc` for indexing the Series. This fix should address the KeyError issue observed in the failing tests.
