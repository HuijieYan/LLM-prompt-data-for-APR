## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is improperly handling different types of indexers. The issue arises when passing a list as an indexer, causing a `KeyError` instead of treating it the same way as other indexer types like arrays. This inconsistency leads to failing tests and raises confusion among users.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to handle list indexers similarly to other array-like indexers by performing the necessary operations without raising a `KeyError`. We can achieve this by ensuring that list indexers are processed correctly within the function's logic.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers properly, the corrected version ensures consistency in handling array-like indexers, including lists, which resolves the reported issue on GitHub.
