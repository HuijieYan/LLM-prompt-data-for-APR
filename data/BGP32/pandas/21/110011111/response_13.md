## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function in the `pandas.core.series.Series` class when different types of indexers are provided. The issue arises when using a list indexer causing a `KeyError` due to inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other index types.

The bug arises because the function fails to handle list-like indexers in the same way as other types like numpy arrays or Pandas Index objects. This inconsistency leads to a `KeyError` when trying to index with a list.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other index types such as numpy arrays or Pandas Index objects. This can be achieved by updating the logic in `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list indexers consistently with other index types, resolving the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests. This should align with the expectations outlined for each case.
