### Bug Analysis
1. **Buggy function relation**: The `_get_with` function is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
   
2. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is expected to be raised, but it is not raised during the test execution.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The conditionals for different types of `key` inputs might not be handling all cases correctly.
2. The logic to determine the `key_type` and the subsequent decision making based on that might have issues.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to how different types of `key` inputs are handled inside the `_get_with` function. 

- When a `list` is passed as `key`, it should ideally raise a `KeyError`, but due to the current implementation, it does not.
- The `key_type` inference, especially for a `list` input, might not be working as intended.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the different types of `key` inputs and raises a `KeyError` when needed.

### Fixing the Bug
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the Index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the Index")
```

This corrected version ensures that a `KeyError` is raised when needed, particularly for the case of a `list` input. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
