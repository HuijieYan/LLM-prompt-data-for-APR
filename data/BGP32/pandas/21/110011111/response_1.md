### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling indexing using a Python `list` correctly. It treats list indexers differently from other array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior. When attempting to index a Series with a list that contains no matching items in the Series index, it raises a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with how indexing with other array-like types is handled, leading to unexpected results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the function `_get_with` needs to handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers. By ensuring that all different indexers have the same behavior when no matches are found, we can address the issue.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    indexer = key if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else list(key)
    key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if not self.index.is_unique and key_type == "string":
        if len(set(indexer).intersection(self.index)) == 0:
            return self.reindex(indexer)
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[indexer]
        return self.iloc[indexer]

    return self.reindex(indexer)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- Added a check for uniqueness of the index to ensure consistent behavior with string-based indexers.
- Implement a check to verify if any items in the indexer list intersect with the Series index. If no matches are found, then reindex the Series.
- Adjusted the logic to use the `indexer` variable consistently for all index types.
- Introduced conditional statements to cover different scenarios and provide a coherent response to list indexers with no matches.

By making these changes, the updated function should now handle list indexers appropriately and align the behavior with other array-like indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
