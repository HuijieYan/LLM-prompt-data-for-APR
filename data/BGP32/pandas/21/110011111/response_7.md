## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. When the function receives a list-like indexer `key`, it tries to reindex the `Series` object based on this indexer. However, the logic to handle different types of indexers is causing an inconsistency, leading to a `KeyError` in certain cases.

The function first checks if the `key` is a slice, dataframe, or tuple. Then, it proceeds to handle cases for non-list-like indexers and different types of indexers, including `Index`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, etc. The bug arises from treating a list-like indexer differently from other array-like indexers.

In the failing test cases, when passing a list-like indexer to the `ser[key]` operation, it results in a `KeyError` because of the inconsistency in how list-like indexers are handled compared to other array-like indexers such as `Index`, `np.ndarray`, or `pd.Series`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and ensure consistent handling of all array-like indexers, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class to treat list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers. By unifying the behavior for all array-like indexers, we can resolve the `KeyError` issue that arises when using list-like indexers.

Additionally, the fix should align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue, where all types of indexers behave consistently and `KeyError` is raised only when there are no matches in the index.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if key_type == "boolean":
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

        return self.reindex(key)

    elif isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    else:
        # Scalar or other cases
        return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the logic to handle different types of indexers uniformly, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle list-like indexers without raising a `KeyError` and ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers in the `pandas` library.
