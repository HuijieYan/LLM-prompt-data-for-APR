### Bug Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling a list-like key properly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the key that is not present in the index.
- The function checks the type of the key and branches into different cases based on the key type. However, the handling of list-like keys is causing the bug.
- The error message from the failing test indicates that using a list as a key is not working as expected, and it should behave consistently with other types of key input.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test cases, the keys provided are either list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
- The function does not handle list-like keys appropriately, leading to a KeyError when trying to access missing keys.
- The key_type inferred as 'string' should not occur, as it should be inferred based on the type of the key provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly by either updating the way they are processed or ensuring consistent behavior with other types of keys.
- Make sure to handle the presence of the key properly within the index before operating on it.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_arr = None
    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_arr = key.values
    else:
        key_arr = np.asarray(key)
    
    if lib.inferred_type(key_arr) == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- Added a condition to convert list-like keys to numpy arrays to ensure consistency.
- Updated the logic for inferring key type using `lib.inferred_type`.
- Utilize the numpy array of the key to determine its dtype and handle integer indexes appropriately.
- By handling list-like keys uniformly with other types, the function should now behave consistently and avoid KeyError issues.
