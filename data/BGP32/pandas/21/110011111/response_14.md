Based on the given information, the issue arises from inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types like lists, arrays, Index, and Series objects. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class does not handle the list-like key properly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to index with a list. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the indexing with list-like objects behaves consistently with other types.

To address the issue, we can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys correctly. We will revise the key checking logic to treat all list-like objects in the same way as arrays or Index objects to avoid the `KeyError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Treat all list-like objects the same way as arrays or Index objects
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function will now correctly handle list-like keys without raising a `KeyError` and ensure consistent behavior across different types of objects used for indexing. This correction aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list-like objects.
