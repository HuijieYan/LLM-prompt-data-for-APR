## Bug Fix Strategy
Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue lies in how the function handles different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list. Since the test cases expect consistency in behavior regardless of the type of indexer used, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers to align with the behavior of other indexers.

To fix the bug:
- Modify the code section responsible for handling list indexers to ensure consistency in behavior.
- Make sure that list indexers are processed correctly without raising errors that are not in line with the expected behavior.

With this strategy in mind, let's provide a corrected version of the `_get_with` function.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the issue reported in the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to inconsistent behavior with different indexer types.
