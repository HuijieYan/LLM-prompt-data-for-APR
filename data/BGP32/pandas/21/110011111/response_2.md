The issue seems to stem from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, array-like, Index) in the `ser[key]` operation. It throws a KeyError for a list indexer but not for other types. To address this bug, we need to ensure consistency in how different indexers are handled during the operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/series.py

class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):

    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        key_list = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key_list]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key_list]
        
        return self.reindex(key_list)
```

In the corrected version:
1. We ensure that when `key` is not list-like, it is directly passed to `self.loc` for proper indexing.
2. We handle the `Index` case by extracting a list from the `Index` object.
3. For cases where `key` is a list, we ensure consistency by directly using the list to index with `self.loc`.

This correction should now pass the failing tests, maintain consistency in handling different indexers, and align with the expected input/output values.
