## Analyze the buggy function
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to return a modified version of the Series object based on the input key. The function handles different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others, to retrieve values from the Series.

## Identify potential error locations
1. The key type handling inside the function (_get_with) might lead to incorrect logic when determining the type of key provided.
2. The condition to check if the key is list-like might not be accurate in all cases.
3. The logic to differentiate between different key types (e.g., integer, boolean, list) could be causing unexpected behavior.

## Explain the cause of the bug
The bug is likely due to incorrect key type detection and handling inside the `_get_with` function. This incorrect type inference may lead to wrong behavior when processing the key to retrieve values from the Series. The key is not being properly recognized or processed in specific cases.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled when attempting to access values from the Series. The failing test cases indicate that passing a list as a key results in a KeyError, while other indexers work fine.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the key's type is correctly identified and processed. Additionally, the function should be modified to handle list-like keys appropriately to prevent the KeyError reported in the failing tests. Improving the type detection and key handling logic should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle cases where the key is a different type
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type detection mechanism and properly handling list-like keys within the function, the corrected version should address the issues reported in the failing tests and the GitHub bug.
