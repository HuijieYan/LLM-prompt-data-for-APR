Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, the issue lies in how different types of indexers are handled inconsistently, specifically when dealing with list indexers. The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to the function `_get_with`, leading to a `KeyError` without proper handling.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the conditional statement that processes the input key in the `_get_with` function. When the key is not recognized as list-like or array-like and is not an Index object, the function attempts to return the result by using the `loc` method directly on the key. This leads to a `KeyError` as the behavior of trying to access an item from a Series with a list indexer isn't consistent with other types of indexers.

### Solution Strategy:
To fix this bug, the conditional flow for handling key types that are not list-like should be modified to avoid the `KeyError` issue. Ensure that proper handling is in place for list-like indexers to align with the behavior of other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the inconsistent behavior when using list indexers as shown in the failing test cases should be resolved.
