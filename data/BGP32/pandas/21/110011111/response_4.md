## Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key input to extract values from a Series object. 
- The failing tests indicate that when using a list as a key, the function is not behaving as expected, leading to a `KeyError`.
- The function has conditions to handle slice, DataFrame, tuple, and scalar key types, but the handling of a list-like key is causing the issue.
- The GitHub issue suggests that using a list as an indexer is behaving inconsistently compared to other array-like indexers.

## Bug Cause
- The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of list-like keys where the code fails to appropriately extract the values from the Series object using the given list key.

## Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list key is provided, the function can correctly extract values without raising a `KeyError`.
- This can be achieved by adjusting the logic to handle list-like keys similar to other array-like indexers.

## Fixed Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Adjusted handling for list-like keys
    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the fixed function, the issue of handling list-like keys is addressed, and the function should now be able to correctly extract values from the Series object without raising a `KeyError`.
