### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is causing a `KeyError` when indexing with a list that has no matches in the Series index.
2. The function has conditional blocks to handle different types of keys, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and others.
3. The bug occurs when a list key is provided, and the function tries to reindex based on the key, resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case of a list key differently and avoid the `KeyError` by ensuring that the indexing operation proceeds correctly.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises due to the incorrect handling of the list key type. When trying to index with a list key, instead of returning a value from the Series based on the key, the function attempts to reindex using the list key, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should directly return the values corresponding to the list key from the Series without attempting to reindex. This approach will prevent the `KeyError` when the key does not match any index values.

### Updated Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function is updated to handle list keys appropriately without causing a `KeyError` when indexing with a list with no matches in the index. This fix ensures that the function behaves consistently and correctly with different types of indexers.
