### Analysis:
1. The `Series` class has a method `_get_with` that is responsible for handling different types of indexers, like slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc. The buggy function seems to have an issue with correctly handling the case when the indexer is a list.
2. The test cases provided demonstrate that when using different kinds of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series), the behavior is inconsistent, and specifically, the list indexer case is causing a `KeyError`.
3. The bug seems to arise from the confusion in handling different types of indexers within the function, leading to incorrect behavior and error cases.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers and ensure that the correct values are returned based on the type of indexer used.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently and correctly identify the type of indexer being used.
2. Ensure that the function returns the correct values based on the type of indexer provided, avoiding any potential `KeyError`.
3. Refactor the code to have a clear distinction between the different types of indexers and the corresponding actions to be taken for each type.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # Handle list indexer case
    if is_list_like(key):
        # Handle the case where key is a list
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle other types of indexers
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle other cases like individual scalars
    return self.loc[key]
```

By making these corrections to the function, we ensure that the behavior is consistent and correct across different types of indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing tests.
