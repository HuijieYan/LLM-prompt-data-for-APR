### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The function is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. However, the bug arises when dealing with a key that is a list. The issue is that when the key is a list, the function fails to properly handle it and raises a `KeyError` exception.

The failing tests try to index a Series using different types of keys (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`). The expected behavior is consistent for all these key types, except for `list` where the bug occurs.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function can properly handle the case when the key is a list. We should make the behavior consistent across different key types to align with expectations.

### Correction of the Buggy Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Correction Rationale:
- By changing the condition to check for any of the key types recognized as valid for indexing, we can include `list` among other types.
- Using the `loc` indexer for all recognized key types ensures a consistent behavior for indexing different input types.
- This fix addresses the inconsistency in the original function's behavior for list key inputs and aligns it with the expected behavior across different types.
