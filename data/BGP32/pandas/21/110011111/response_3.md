### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is experiencing issues when dealing with different types of indexers, specifically when the input `key` is a list. The function is supposed to handle different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, and non-list-like objects correctly. However, due to a conditional check for `is_list_like` that leads to using `loc` on the key, the function fails for list inputs causing a KeyError.

The main issue arises from the use of `is_list_like` to check the type of the key. When the key is a list, the function attempts to access the elements using `self.loc[key]`, which results in a KeyError when the element is not in the index.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly treats a list-like `key` by attempting to access it using `self.loc[key]`. Since a list index like this is not present in the index, it raises a KeyError, leading to test failures. The function does not correctly handle list-like objects causing the unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle list-like keys differently. Instead of trying to access the elements directly using `self.loc[key]`, we should rework the logic to handle list-like keys appropriately, either by returning the elements corresponding to the positions in the list or reindexing if needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer" or not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        keys = key
    else:  # Convert non-list-like object to list
        keys = list(key)
        
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[keys]
        else:
            return self.iloc[keys]
    
    return self.reindex(keys)
```

By making these corrections, the function now correctly handles list-like keys and should pass the failing tests while also aligning with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.
