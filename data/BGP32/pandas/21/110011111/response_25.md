### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers like slice, DataFrame, tuple, etc., for a Series object.
2. The failing tests are indicating that when using a list-like indexer, the function is not returning the expected result, leading to a KeyError.
3. The key_type inferred in the buggy function seems to be incorrect for list-like indexers, resulting in the wrong path of execution in the function.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a wrong key_type inference for list-like indexers, leading to the function taking the incorrect path of execution and resulting in a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the key_type inference for list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function and ensure that the function handles list-like indexers correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['string', 'floating', 'mixed-integer']:  # Update the key_type conditions for list-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key_type conditions to include the relevant types for list-like indexers and ensuring that the correct path of execution is followed based on the indexer type, we can fix the bug and make the function behave consistently for all types of indexers as desired.
