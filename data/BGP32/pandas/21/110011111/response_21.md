## Analysis
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists. The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to the function. The function deals differently with list-like indexers compared to other types like arrays or DataFrames. This inconsistency leads to failing tests as shown in the provided test cases.

### Bug Explanation
1. The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to the `_get_with` function.
2. When a list-like indexer is passed, the function tries to reindex the data based on the indexer, which leads to a `KeyError` if the list elements are not present in the Series index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. We should not reindex the data based on the list-like indexer, as this leads to a `KeyError`. Instead, we should raise an error similar to other indexers like arrays or DataFrames.

### Corrected Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

With this fix, we handle list-like indexers consistently and raise a `KeyError` for all cases where the indexer elements are not found in the Series index. This aligns with the expected behavior for array-like and DataFrame indexers.
