### Identify the Bug
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the conditional block where it checks if the key is not list-like, and then calls `self.loc[key]`. This approach doesn't handle certain cases correctly, leading to failing tests.

### Explain the Bug
Based on the failing tests and the debug information:
- When a key that is not list-like is passed, it goes to the last `elif` block and tries to access `self.loc[key]`.
- This fails to locate the key properly and raises a `KeyError` exception.

### Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we should update how the function handles cases where the key is not list-like. Instead of trying to access `self.loc[key]`, we should follow a better strategy:
- Check if the key is not list-like and if it's an array-like object.
- If so, convert it to a list and then proceed with further handling.

### The Corrected Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version will handle non-list-like keys more effectively, ensuring that the proper data indexing is performed and resolving the failing tests.
