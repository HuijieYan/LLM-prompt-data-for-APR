The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is encountering issues when handling different types of indexers, leading to failing tests due to inconsistent behavior. The problem arises when treating list-like indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing an error when using a list as an indexer. To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is treating list-like indexers differently from array-like indexers. This inconsistency leads to an error when using a list as an indexer, as observed in the failing test cases. The function currently does not handle list-like indexers correctly, causing the tests to fail with a `KeyError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats all types of indexers consistently. By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers in the same way as array-like indexers, we can resolve the inconsistencies and pass the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, the function now maintains consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This correction should address the failing tests and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
