The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. When a `list` type key is used, the function raises a `KeyError` instead of returning `NaN`, which causes the failing test cases.

### Error Cause:
1. The key is checked for being list-like, and if it's not recognized as a list, `self.loc[key]` is called. However, the following `else` clause mistakenly attempts to handle some additional cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Proposed Fix:
To resolve the bug, modify the function to handle list-like keys properly and avoid raising a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Update this part to handle list-like keys correctly
    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case of a list-like key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `if` condition for handling list-like keys and ensuring correct handling for different key types, this corrected version should pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values and the issue reported on GitHub.
