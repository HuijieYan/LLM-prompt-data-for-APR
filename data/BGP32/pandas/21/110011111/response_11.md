### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when dealing with indexers that are lists. The function treats a list indexer differently from other array-like indexers such as numpy arrays or Pandas Index objects, leading to inconsistent behavior.

The issue arises because when the function encounters a list-like indexer, it tries to convert it to an Index object to get the inferred data type. However, in the case of list indexers, this conversion can lead to incorrect behavior and eventually raise a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent keys in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with list-like indexers. We should handle list-like indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers, avoiding unnecessary conversions that might lead to incorrect key access.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = key.values if isinstance(key, Series) else key

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the code to handle list-like indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, we ensure that the function behaves correctly across different types of input indexers.
