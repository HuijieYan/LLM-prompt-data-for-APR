### Analysis:
1. Buggy Function and Class Relationship:
   - The `_get_with` function is part of the `Series` class in pandas, responsible for handling different types of indexers for a Series object.
   - The issue arises when trying to access the Series using a list as an indexer, leading to inconsistent behavior.

2. Potential Error Locations:
   - The handling of different indexer types within the function, specifically when dealing with list-like indexers.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug occurs because the function does not handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError when trying to access elements not present in the Series index.
   - As demonstrated by the failing test cases, different types of indexers (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) result in different behaviors, causing inconsistency.

4. Bug Fix Strategy:
   - To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure consistent behavior when accessing elements using list-like indexers.
   - The function needs to handle list-like indexers appropriately to align with the expected behavior.

### Correction:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the last part of the function to handle list-like indexers consistently, the bug should be fixed. This correction aligns the behavior with the expected outcome and resolves the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue.
