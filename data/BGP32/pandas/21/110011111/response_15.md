### Cause of the Bug
The bug originates from how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is provided. The current implementation treats list indexers differently from array-like indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising a `KeyError` in some cases.

When a list indexer is passed to the function, it goes through checks for different types of indexers (`Index`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, etc.). However, the handling of a list indexer results in a `KeyError` because it is not properly reindexed or converted for the Series object.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including list indexers. We should handle list indexers similarly to other array-like indexers by reindexing them correctly. Additionally, we need to account for cases where the list indexer doesn't match any index values in the Series.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers. This should ensure consistent behavior and prevent the `KeyError` from occurring when using a list indexer.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing tests and address the issue reported on GitHub regarding inconsistent behavior with different types of indexers.
