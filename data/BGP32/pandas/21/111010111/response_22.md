### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with()` is designed to handle different types of keys passed to a Series object. It distinguishes between slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, and other types of keys to retrieve corresponding values.
2. The error message indicates that when trying to access a Series using a list-like key, it fails to raise a KeyError as expected.
3. The bug occurs in the handling of list-like keys, where the KeyError is not raised when accessing values. This inconsistency is highlighted in the GitHub issue related to this bug.
4. The bug fix involves ensuring that the handling of list-like keys correctly raises a KeyError when the key is not present in the index of the Series.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with()` function:
1. Check if the key is list-like and if it is not found in the Series index, raise a KeyError.
2. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of key inputs, aligning with the expected output values and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not self.index.isin(key).all():
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition to check if the key is list-like and raising a KeyError when the key is not present in the Series index, the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function should now pass the failing test and align with the expected input/output values.
