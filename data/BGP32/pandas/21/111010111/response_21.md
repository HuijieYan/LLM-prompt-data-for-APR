### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, etc.) for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to arise when the key is a list, and the function tries to handle it differently based on its type.
3. The error message indicates that when indexing a Series using a list key, the function fails to handle it correctly and does not raise a KeyError as expected.
4. The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are provided for four different cases, specifying the expected behavior for different types of keys.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the function failing to handle list-like keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to index the Series. The discrepancy in behavior for list keys compared to other types of keys causes the test to fail and the incorrect handling of the key type results in an incorrect return value in some cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys and behaves consistently for all types of keys. We should modify the logic to process list keys in a way that aligns with the correct indexing behavior expected by the test cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        # handle the case of list-like key
        key = list(key)
        return self.loc[key]
```

By handling list-like keys as a separate condition and ensuring consistent behavior for all types of keys, the corrected version should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values for the failing test cases.
