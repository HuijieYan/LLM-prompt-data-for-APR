### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message from the failing test indicates that there is inconsistency when using different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series), as the behavior is not consistent for all cases.
3. The expected input/output values and types are provided for each test case.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a list key. The `_get_with` function does not handle the list key appropriately, leading to a `KeyError`. This inconsistency is causing failures in the test cases provided.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list keys, similar to how other types of indexers are handled. This involves updating the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list keys properly.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list key
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should properly handle list-like keys for indexing a Series, resolving the inconsistency and passing the failing test cases.
