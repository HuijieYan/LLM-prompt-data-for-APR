### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The issue arises when a list indexer is passed to the function, which triggers an error that none of the elements in the list are in the index.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the expected behavior for list/ndarray/Index/Series should be consistent, but currently, the list case is different.
4. The function does not handle the list indexer correctly and throws an error when trying to locate elements that do not exist in the index.
5. The expected key type in the function is `'string'`, but the list indexer is not appropriately handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to correctly handle list indexers like other types with the same behavior.
2. Update the logic to handle the list indexer by converting it into expected data structures for further processing.
3. Ensure that the function handles the list indexer and locates elements in the index without triggering KeyError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index if it's a list
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes additional logic to handle list indexers correctly by converting them into an Index type before further processing. This modification ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers in a Series object.
