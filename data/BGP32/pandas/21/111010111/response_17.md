### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module is responsible for handling different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test cases involve passing in different types of key inputs like a list, ndarray, Index, and Series, which should all return consistent behavior.
3. The error message indicates that for certain types of key inputs, a KeyError is being raised when it should not be.
4. The expected behavior is to handle the different key types consistently and return the appropriate values from the Series without raising errors.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The bug lies in the handling of different key types within the `_get_with` function.
2. The function checks the type of the key and processes it differently based on the type, such as Index, list, ndarray, Series, etc.
3. In the case of passing a list as a key, the function incorrectly calls `self.reindex(key)` which leads to a KeyError being raised if the key is not found in the index.
4. The expected behavior should be that if the key type is a list, it should try to handle the indexing directly from the Series without raising a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic for handling list keys to directly handle the indexing from the Series.
2. Remove the call to `self.reindex(key)` for list keys to prevent KeyError from being raised.
3. Ensure that the function processes all key types consistently and returns the expected values without raising errors.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the handling of list keys to directly return the value from the Series instead of calling `self.reindex(key)`, the bug should be fixed and the function should behave consistently for all key input types.
