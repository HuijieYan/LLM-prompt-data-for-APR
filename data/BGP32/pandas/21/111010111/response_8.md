### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used to handle different types of indexers like slice, DataFrame, tuple, scalar, list, ndarray, etc.
2. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list indexer `ser[key]`.
3. The bug occurs when the function encounters a list indexer. It treats the list indexer differently from other types of indexers, leading to an inconsistency in behavior.
4. The function should handle the list indexer in a consistent way with other types of indexers to align with expected behavior and resolve the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function compared to other types of indexers. This inconsistency results in a `KeyError` when trying to access elements from a Series using a list indexer.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are treated consistently with other types of indexers. We can modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (pd.Index, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key].reindex(self.index)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "string":
            return self.loc[key].reindex(self.index)
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function to consistently handle list indexers like other array-like indexers, the corrected version aligns the behavior with the expected output and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
