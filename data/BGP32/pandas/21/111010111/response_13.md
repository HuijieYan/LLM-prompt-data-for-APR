Based on the provided information, we can see that the issue is related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers such as lists, arrays, and series. The function treats them differently, leading to inconsistent behavior when trying to access elements that don't exist in the series.

The key problem lies in the conditional blocks that check the type of the `key` parameter. More specifically, the `if not is_list_like(key)` block is causing the issue by not handling the case where the key is a list. This results in a KeyError being raised when trying to access elements that are not in the series.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the function properly handles list-like keys, such as lists, arrays, and series. We can make adjustments to the conditional blocks to ensure that the function behaves consistently for all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Treat all array-like indexers in the same way
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function will handle list-like indexers consistently, allowing the function to return the expected results without raising any KeyErrors. This fix aligns with the GitHub issue description and ensures that all types of indexers are treated uniformly in the `_get_with` function.
