### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in Pandas, which is used for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of the key being used for indexing and then performs specific actions based on the type.
2. The bug occurs when the key parameter is a list-like object. The buggy function is not correctly handling the case when the key is a list or ndarray, resulting in a KeyError.
3. The failing test cases indicate that when indexing a Series using a list, ndarray, Index, or a Series object as the key, the expected behavior should be consistent. However, the current implementation fails to handle the list case correctly, leading to the KeyError.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a list, the function correctly handles the indexing operation to avoid the KeyError.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case when the key is a list or ndarray. We can implement this by explicitly checking for list-like objects and performing the indexing operation accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[list(key)]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking for list-like objects and handling the indexing operation accordingly, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases and provide consistent behavior when indexing a Series with list, ndarray, Index, or Series objects as keys.
