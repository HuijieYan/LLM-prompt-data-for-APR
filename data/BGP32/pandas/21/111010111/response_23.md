### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and others.
2. The failing test cases are focusing on the behavior of passing a list-like key input to the Series object.
3. The bug seems to be related to the inconsistent behavior of different types of indexers, especially when a list-like key is passed.
4. The error occurs when the key is a list-like object, and the function does not handle it correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.
5. The expected behavior is for the `ser` Series to handle list-like key input similar to other array-like indexers.
6. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, and the desire to make them behave consistently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the function `_get_with` not correctly handling list-like keys, leading to a `KeyError` when attempting to slice the Series with a list-like indexer.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list-like key is passed to the Series, it is handled properly, similar to other array-like indexers. This can be achieved by modifying the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly process list-like keys.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should properly handle list-like keys when passed to the Series, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
