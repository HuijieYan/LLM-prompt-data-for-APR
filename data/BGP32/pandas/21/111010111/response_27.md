### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of key input, including slice, DataFrame, tuple, and other data types.
2. The bug occurs when the key input is a list-like object, where the function incorrectly checks if the key is an instance of `Index` and then attempts to infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`.
3. The key type inference logic, when applied to a list-like key, incorrectly infers the key type as "integer" in some cases, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and resulting in a `KeyError`.
4. The expectation is that the key type should be inferred correctly for list-like keys to avoid the KeyError, similar to how other types of keys are handled correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Adjust the logic for inferring the key type when the input key is a list or array-like.
2. Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently and properly indexed within the Series object.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "mixed":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type inference logic for list-like keys and ensuring that the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is chosen based on the key type, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys correctly and resolve the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.
