### Bug Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a series.
2. The bug occurs when the key input is a list-like object, leading to an error in the indexing process.
3. The error message indicates that there is inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.
4. The expected behavior is that all types of indexers should behave the same way, returning NaN when the index doesn't exist.
5. The bug results in a KeyError when trying to index with a list-like object in certain scenarios.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Revise the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like key inputs consistently with other array-like indexers.
2. Ensure that the function returns NaN values when the index doesn't exist for list-like key inputs.
3. Confirm that the function follows the expected behavior for indexing with different types of indexers.
4. Update the method to align with the issue raised on GitHub regarding the inconsistency in indexing behavior.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string"):  # Updated to handle string key types for consistency
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)  # Handle all other cases consistently
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the function should now handle list-like key inputs consistently with other types of indexers, ensuring a NaN return when the index does not exist. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue raised on GitHub regarding indexing inconsistencies.
