## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is encountering an issue when using a list-like key for indexing. The function is not properly handling the list indexer, leading to a KeyError that is not being raised as expected. This behavior is inconsistent compared to how other indexers like array-like, Index, and Series are handled.

The function `_get_with` first checks if the key is a slice, then checks if it is a DataFrame, and finally handles other types of keys like tuple or scalar values. However, when it comes to handling list-like keys, the function does not properly differentiate between different list-like types.

The error message indicates that none of the elements in the key list are found in the index, causing a KeyError to be raised. This behavior is not consistent with the expected outcome, especially when compared to how other indexers are handled in similar scenarios.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the improper handling of list-like keys. When a list-like key is encountered, the function does not differentiate between different types of list-like objects, leading to unexpected behavior and a KeyError being raised even though the elements are present in the index.

## Proposed Fix
To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function needs to properly handle list-like keys and ensure that the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers. We need to differentiate between different list-like types and handle them appropriately to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are properly handled, and the behavior is consistent with other types of indexers in the pandas `Series` class. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output values.
