### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with()` is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, non-list-like scalars, etc.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` parameter is in the form of a list, array-like index, or Series instance.
3. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError when the provided index does not match any values in the Series index, but currently, it is not working as expected for list-like inputs, array-like inputs, and Series instances.
4. The issue mentioned in the GitHub thread revolves around the inconsistency in behavior when indexing Series with different types of indexers.
5. The bug causes the function to fail for cases where list, ndarray, Index, or Series instances are used as indexers, resulting in a KeyError not being raised when it should be.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function properly handles list, array-like index, and Series instances as indexers.
2. We should ensure that a KeyError is raised if the provided index does not match any values in the Series index.
3. The bug fix should align with the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series)):
        if not any(idx in self.index for idx in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing these changes, the corrected function should now handle list-like, array-like, and Series indexers correctly, ensuring that a KeyError is raised when necessary as per the expected behavior.
