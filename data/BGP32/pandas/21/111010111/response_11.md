### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, tuples, lists, arrays, and series.
2. The bug arises when passing a list indexer specifically, as it does not handle it properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to access the data based on the list indexer.
3. The issue is related to inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers (`Index`, `np.array`, `Series`, `list`) and how they are processed in the Series indexing operation.
4. The failing test is a direct result of this inconsistency, expecting an error due to `None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]`.
5. The expected key type for the failing test is a string.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly by ensuring that the data is accessed appropriately when a list indexer is passed.
2. Adjust the logic to properly handle list-like objects to avoid the `KeyError` and ensure consistency in the behavior of different indexer types.
3. The key type should be inferred correctly for list-like objects to determine whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`).

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
            key = list(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version of the function, the issue should be resolved, and the function should handle list indexers correctly, passing the failing test and maintaining consistency with other indexer types.
