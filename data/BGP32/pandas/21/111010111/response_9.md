### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, and the code path taken for handling the list indexer is incorrect.
3. The error message in the failing test indicates that the function does not raise a `KeyError` when accessing non-existent values with a list key.
4. The expected behavior is that the function should raise a `KeyError` when trying to access a key that does not exist in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `key = list(key)` statement in the function. This statement converts the input `key` to a list even if it is already a list. As a result, when the key is then passed to subsequent checks, it does not work as expected with a list input.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the redundant conversion of the `key` to a list in the function.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles the case where `key` is already a list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values  # Extract the values of the Index, if needed

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Infer the dtype of the key

    # Check if key_type is 'mixed' which is a list-like key
    if key_type == 'mixed':
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By removing the unnecessary conversion of `key` to a list and handling list-like keys appropriately, the corrected function should now raise a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent values using a list key.
