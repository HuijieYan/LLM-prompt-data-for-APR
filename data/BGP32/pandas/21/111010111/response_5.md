### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects. The bug is related to how the function handles list-like indexers.
2. The bug occurs when a Series object is passed as the indexer (key), which triggers an error when trying to use it for indexing.
3. The bug triggers a KeyError because the function erroneously tries to treat the Series instance as a valid indexer.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle Series objects as indexers differently, ensuring it aligns with the intended behavior when indexing Series objects.
5. The incorrect handling of a Series object as an indexer should be modified to avoid the KeyError and allow proper indexing.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check if the key is a Series object
    if isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.to_numpy()
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a check to convert a Series object to a NumPy array before further processing, the function will now correctly handle Series objects as indexers, avoiding the KeyError and aligning with the expected behavior.
