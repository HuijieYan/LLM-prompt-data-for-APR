### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is used to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series. However, there seems to be an issue with how it handles the case when a list-like key input is provided.
2. The failing test is expecting a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list-like key, but the current implementation is not raising the `KeyError` as expected.
3. The error message indicates that the issue lies in the behavior difference between different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index) when used with a Series, leading to inconsistency.
4. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` when the key from a list-like input is not found in the Series index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index) in the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is provided, the function does not raise a `KeyError` as expected, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, a check should be added to raise a `KeyError` when the key from a list-like input is not found in the Series index. This will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Check if key exists in the index
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series)) and any(k not in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will now raise a `KeyError` when indexing a Series with a list-like key that contains values not present in the Series index. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
