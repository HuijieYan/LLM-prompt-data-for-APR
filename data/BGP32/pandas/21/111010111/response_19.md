### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers including slice, DataFrame, tuple, and others.
2. The failing test cases indicate that when a Series is indexed with key as a list, the KeyError is not being raised as expected.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list indexers, where the KeyError is not being raised even though the key is not present in the index.
4. The expected behavior is that when indexing with a list that contains a key not present in the index, a KeyError should be raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of list indexers in the `_get_with` function. The logic for checking if the key is present in the index is not working as expected when the key is of type list.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is of type list and the key is not present in the index, a KeyError should be raised as expected.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Raise KeyError if any key in the list is not in the index
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle list indexers and raise a KeyError if any of the keys in the list are not present in the index.
