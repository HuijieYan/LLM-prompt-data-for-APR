### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The error message indicates that the test case is failing when using a `list` as an index key, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The function is not handling the case when `key` is a `list` properly, resulting in the incorrect behavior and failing test cases.
4. The expected behavior for all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) should be consistent according to the GitHub issue.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of `key` when it is a `list` and ensure it behaves consistently with other index types.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `key` is a `list` and ensure it is converted to the appropriate format for indexing.
2. Update the conditional statements to handle `key` being a `list` correctly.
3. Ensure the function returns the expected output for all index types.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle the case if the key is a list
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific condition to handle `key` when it is a list, the corrected function should now behave consistently for all types of indexers as expected.
