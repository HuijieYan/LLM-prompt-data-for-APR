## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series` is designed to handle different types of indexing keys (`key`) such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other index-like objects. The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is a list-like object, and the function tries to treat it as an index for a `Series` instance.

The bug is related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers such as arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. The bug results in a KeyError when trying to index a `Series` with a list-like object.

The fixes need to align the behavior of list indexers with other array-like indexers and ensure that the function handles the indexing uniformly for all supported types.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs due to the handling of list-like indexers differently from other array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. The bug results in a KeyError when trying to access values from the `Series` using a list-like key.

## Fix Strategy
We need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to treat list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers such as arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. This requires handling list-like keys appropriately and aligning the behavior with the expected outcomes.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key as an index or fall back to loc
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['string', 'unicode']:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

By updating the condition for handling list-like keys and ensuring that all expected key types are appropriately handled, this corrected version aims to resolve the bug and align the behavior with the expected outcomes described in the test cases.
