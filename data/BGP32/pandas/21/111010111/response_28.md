## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library, which deals with indexing operations on a one-dimensional array with axis labels.
2. The function takes a `key` parameter which can be of various types like a slice, DataFrame, tuple, list, ndarray, etc.
3. The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is a list, causing an inconsistency in behavior with other types of key parameters such as ndarray, Series, Index, etc.
4. The error message indicates that when indexing with a list key, a KeyError is raised, which is not the expected behavior.
5. The expected behavior is to handle list indexers the same way as other compatible indexers like ndarray or Series.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the `_get_with` function, there are checks to handle different types of `key` parameters.
2. When `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, it tries to index the Series using `self.loc[key]`.
3. The issue arises when `key` is a list because it is not correctly handled.
4. As a result, inappropriate indexing with a list key leads to a KeyError, causing the test to fail.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the handling of list-like keys to ensure consistent behavior with other types of valid keys.
2. Update the logic to appropriately handle list keys by following a similar path as ndarray, Series, or Index keys.
3. Avoid raising a KeyError when indexing with a list key, provided the key values are within the Series index range.

## Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys similar to ndarray, Series, or Index keys
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Fallback to reindex if list key is out of bounds
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying the corrected function, the expected test cases should pass, resolving the inconsistency in handling list-like keys for indexing in the `Series` class of the pandas library.
