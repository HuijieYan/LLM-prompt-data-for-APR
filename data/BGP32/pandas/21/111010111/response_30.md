### Analysis
1. The `key` parameter in the buggy function is being checked for its type and then processed accordingly. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object, which leads to an incorrect branching in the function.
2. The bug is identified in the part where the function checks if the key is not list-like. If it is not list-like, it attempts to access `self.loc[key]`, which results in the KeyError during the test execution.
3. The bug is causing the function to incorrectly handle list-like keys, leading to a KeyError during the test execution. The expected behavior should be consistent across different indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) as mentioned in the GitHub issue description.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like keys correctly by following a consistent behavior across all types of indexers.
5. I will update the code below to address the bug.

### Code Correction
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index))):
            return self.loc[key.to_list()] if hasattr(key, 'to_list') else self.loc[key]
        
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "boolean":
            raise ValueError("Boolean type key is not supported")
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary
By correcting the `_get_with` function as outlined above, the bug related to handling list-like keys will be fixed, ensuring consistent behavior across different indexer types. This fix will address the KeyError issue encountered during the test execution.
