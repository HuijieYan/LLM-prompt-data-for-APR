The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys for indexing the Series. Based on the analysis of the runtime input/output values, it appears that the function is incorrectly identifying the type of key in certain cases, leading to an incorrect execution path.

The bug is likely to be in the condition where it determines the `key_type` based on the input key. The bug causes the function to incorrectly identify the type of the key as a string in some cases, leading to the wrong execution path.

To fix the bug, we can modify the check for the key type to handle the different types of keys more accurately. We can update the code to check for specific types of keys such as `list`, `Index`, `np.ndarray`, `ExtensionArray`, `Series` before inferring the key type and choosing the appropriate execution path.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = "integer" if key.dtype == np.int else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key_type = "extension_array"
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key_type = "series"
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version includes more specific checks for different types of keys before inferring the key type, ensuring a more accurate classification of the key and thus choosing the correct execution path.
