The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of keys passed to the function. The function is trying to infer the type of the key passed (e.g., integer, list, ndarray) and based on that, it decides whether to use positional indexing (`iloc`) or label-based indexing (`loc`). 

However, the logic within the function is faulty, leading to incorrect inference of the key type in some cases. This results in the function returning the wrong type of indexing method (`loc` instead of `iloc`, or vice versa), causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and that the appropriate indexing method is used based on the key type. We can make the logic more robust by checking for specific types and handling them accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):  # check if key is a scalar value
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional checks for scalar values to ensure they are handled correctly. It also refines the logic in inferring the key type to prevent incorrect indexing method selection.

By making these adjustments, the function should now handle different types of keys correctly and return the expected results for the given input scenarios.
