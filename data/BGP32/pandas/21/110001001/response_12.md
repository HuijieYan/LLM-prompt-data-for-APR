The bug in the function `_get_with` is related to incorrect handling of various key types. Based on the provided runtime scenarios, the key_type is always inferred as `'string'`, which indicates that the key type is not being correctly identified in the function. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the identification of key types and ensure that the function branches appropriately based on the type of the key. We can modify the key type inference logic to correctly determine the type of key provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Update key type inference logic
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type provided")
```

In this corrected version, we make sure to infer the key type correctly and handle different types of keys according to their types. This should address the issue of the incorrect key type inference leading to unexpected behavior.
