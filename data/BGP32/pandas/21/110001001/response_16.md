The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type and the subsequent decision-making process based on the key type. The function fails to properly identify the key type, leading to wrong decisions being made during indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified before deciding how to handle the key. We can use the `lib.infer_dtype` function to determine the key type accurately. Based on the identified key type, we can then appropriately handle the key by either using `self.loc` or `self.iloc`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly inferred before proceeding with the indexing operation, addressing the identified bug.
