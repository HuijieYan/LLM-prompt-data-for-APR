The issue in the `_get_with` function is related to the identification of the `key_type`. Based on the provided buggy function and the runtime input/output observations, it seems that the key_type is not being correctly inferred in all cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

In the provided cases, the key is of varying types (list, ndarray, Index, Series), but the key_type is consistently inferred as `'string'`. This indicates a potential issue with the `lib.infer_dtype` function or the conditions that determine the key_type.

To fix this bug, one strategy is to review the logic for inferring the key_type and ensure that it accurately reflects the type of the key being passed. Additionally, it might be necessary to handle different types of keys (list, ndarray, Index, Series) separately to correctly determine the key_type.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we handle cases where the key is an Index or Series separately to correctly infer the key_type based on the type of key being passed. Additionally, we have updated the conditions for handling different types of keys to ensure proper behavior in each case.
