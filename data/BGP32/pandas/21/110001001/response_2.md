The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how the function handles different types of keys for indexing the Series. Based on the provided information and analysis of the runtime values and types of variables, we can identify the potential cause of the bug:

1. The function checks if the key is an instance of a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or not list-like. If the key is not recognized as list-like, it tries to use `self.loc[key]`. However, when the key is a scalar (like in Case 1), the function incorrectly identifies the key as not list-like and tries to access it as a label-based index, leading to the TypeError.

2. The function also checks if the key is an instance of an Index object and tries to infer the key type. However, the inference logic seems to fail in some cases (e.g., Case 3) where the key type is determined as "string" incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the function to correctly handle scalar keys and improve the inference logic for key types. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Handle scalar keys properly

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle scalar keys correctly and improve the inference of key types to prevent incorrect type identification. It is important to test the function with various input scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.
