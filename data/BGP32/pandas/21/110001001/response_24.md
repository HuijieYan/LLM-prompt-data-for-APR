## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function is caused by incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function is supposed to handle different types of keys (slices, dataframes, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.) and return the appropriate result based on the key type. However, the bug occurs when the key type is determined as `'string'` instead of the expected type, leading to incorrect behavior and potentially causing the function to return the wrong result.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and the corresponding logic is applied. Based on the provided buggy function and the runtime variable values, it seems that the key type is erroneously identified as `'string'` in all cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

To address this issue, we can modify the logic for determining the key type and handling different key types. We can also simplify the key type checking to ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the key type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with updated key type handling:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type checking and handling logic in the function, we ensure that the correct operations are applied based on the type of the key provided. This should address the bug and ensure the function behaves as intended for different types of keys.
