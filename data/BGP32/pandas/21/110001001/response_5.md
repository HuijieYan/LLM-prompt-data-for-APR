The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter, leading to the wrong determination of the `key_type`. The function should correctly identify the type of the key for further processing.

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the key is properly identified and handled according to its type. We need to update the logic to correctly determine the `key_type`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is converted to Index if it's not already
    
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key` is properly converted to an `Index` if it's not already and then determines the `key_type` based on the `inferred_type` of the key. Then, it performs the appropriate operations based on the key type.

This correction should address the bug and correctly handle different types of keys for the `Series` object.
