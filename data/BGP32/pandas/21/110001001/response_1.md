The bug in the `_get_with` function revolves around the incorrect handling of different types of `key` inputs. The function fails to adequately distinguish between different types of keys, leading to incorrect processing.

To fix the bug, we need to implement a more robust logic for handling the different types of keys that can be passed to the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key and processes it accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type. Please use a supported key type.")
```

In this corrected version, we have added additional checks to properly handle different types of keys. We have explicitly checked for scalar keys using `is_scalar`, and then perform the necessary operations based on the type of the key. We also included a catch-all else clause to raise an error for unsupported key types.

This should address the issues observed in the buggy function and provide a more robust and comprehensive handling of different key types.
