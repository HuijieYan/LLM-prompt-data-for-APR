### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic to determine the `key_type`. In all cases, the condition `if key_type == "integer":` leads to incorrect results because the `key_type` is wrongly inferred as `'string'` instead of `'object'` or `'string'`. This incorrect inference results in the function taking the wrong path for processing the input `key`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred. Since the incorrect inference happens due to the type of input `key`, it would be beneficial to use the type of `key` itself to determine the correct path. Specifically, in the provided scenarios, the `key` input is a type of list, ndarray, or Index, which should be accounted for in the logic.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = "object"  # Assuming the default type is object, adjust if necessary
            if len(key) > 0:
                first_value = key[0]
                if isinstance(first_value, str):
                    key_type = "string"
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)

```

In the corrected version, the key type is determined based on the type of the input `key`, considering arrays, lists, and Index objects. Additionally, the code accounts for specific cases where the first element of the key might help in refining the inferred type. This adjustment should ensure the correct processing of the input key and prevent the bug from reoccurring.
