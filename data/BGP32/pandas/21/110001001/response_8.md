## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the key being handled incorrectly based on its type in certain cases. The function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, the handling of the key based on its type is causing issues with determining the correct indexing strategy.

In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the key is of type `'string'`, but it is being incorrectly identified as `'integer'`. This misclassification leads to the function attempting to treat the key as an integer indexer when it should be treated as a label-based indexer. This results in the function returning the wrong values or raising errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and handled based on its actual type. We should modify the logic in the function to correctly distinguish between different types of keys and apply the appropriate indexing strategy.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check for the key type being `'string'`, and if so, it directly uses `self.loc[key]`. For keys identified as `'integer'`, it checks if positional or label-based indexing should be used before returning the indexed values appropriately.
