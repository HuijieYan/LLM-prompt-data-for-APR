The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from the incorrect determination of the `key_type`. This leads to the wrong path being taken for indexing the series, causing unexpected behavior.

The key indicators of the bug are:
- The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` in all cases, instead of determining the correct type based on the input key.
- Since the `key_type` is always set as `'string'`, the function may not handle integer indexing or other types correctly.
- The conditionals based on `key_type` (e.g., `'integer'`) lead to the wrong indexing method being selected, resulting in incorrect outputs.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of the input `key`. We can use `isinstance` checks to identify the correct type and adjust the indexing method accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        key_type = 'integer'
    else:
        # Fallback to label-based indexing
        key_type = 'label'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added extra checks to correctly determine the `key_type` based on the type of the input `key`. This should ensure that the function selects the appropriate indexing method and returns the expected results in different scenarios.
