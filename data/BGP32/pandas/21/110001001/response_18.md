The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to how the function handles different types of indexers. The function is attempting to infer the type of the key being used for indexing in the Series, but there are issues with handling various cases. 

From the runtime values provided, we can see that in all cases, the `key_type` variable is being set to `'string'`, regardless of the actual type or structure of the key being passed. This indicates that the logic for determining the `key_type` is not working correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the way the function determines the type of the key being used. We should not directly assign `'string'` to `key_type` as it might not accurately represent the key being used. Instead, we should utilize proper type checking methods to accurately identify the type of key and handle each type accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have used `is_scalar(key)` to properly handle scalar values, adjusted the type checking logic based on the type of key, and handled each case accordingly. This should address the bug and ensure that the function works correctly with different types of indexers.
