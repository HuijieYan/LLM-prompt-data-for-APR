### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(key)` in the `Series` class of the Pandas library is responsible for indexing a `Series` object based on the input key.
2. The bug relates to how different types of keys, specifically lists, are handled when used for indexing.
3. The bug causes inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a list compared to other array-like structures, as highlighted in the failing test.
4. Based on the GitHub issue, the inconsistency in behavior is not intentional, and the desired behavior should be consistent across different types of indexers.

### Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function `_get_with` uses different logic for handling different types of keys.
- When a list key is provided, it indirectly calls `self.loc[key]`, leading to a KeyError if the key elements do not exist in the index.
- This behavior is inconsistent with handling ndarray or Index key types and causes the failing test to raise a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and make the behavior consistent across array-like structures:
1. Ensure that the handling of list keys is consistent with other array-like indexers.
2. Update the code to handle list keys in the same way as ndarray or Index keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function treats list keys similarly to other array-like keys, ensuring consistent behavior across different indexers. This change should resolve the inconsistency and make the function pass the failing test.
