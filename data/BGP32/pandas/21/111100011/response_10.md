## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is trying to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object.
2. The bug is related to how the function processes non-existent keys, particularly when the key is passed as a list.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series, and the expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError`.
4. The GitHub issue indicates the inconsistency in how the Series handles different types of keys for indexing, specifically highlighting the difference in behavior when using list indexers.
5. The bug occurs when the key is a list and the function does not handle it correctly, leading to the `KeyError` exception.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Address the inconsistency in how different types of keys are handled by ensuring consistent behavior when indexing with list-like objects.
2. Modify the condition that handles non-existent keys, especially when the key is passed as a list.
3. Ensure that for all types of keys, including lists, the function raises a `KeyError` when the key does not exist in the Series.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a check to raise a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the Series, for all types of keys, including when the key is a list.
- Ensured that the behavior is consistent regardless of the type of key used to index the Series.
