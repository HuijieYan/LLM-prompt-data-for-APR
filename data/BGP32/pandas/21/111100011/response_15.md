## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle different types of indexers for a `Series` object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses various types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) to access an element that is not present in the `Series`.
3. The bug causes the behavior to be inconsistent depending on the type of indexer used, leading to unexpected errors in certain cases, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

## Bugs:
1. The bug is in the `else` part of the `_get_with` function where it tries to handle non-list-like cases. The code is incorrectly using `not is_list_like(key)` condition to identify scalars, which may lead to the wrong branch.
2. The bug results in incorrect handling of indexers that are not present in the `Series`, causing the test to fail with a `KeyError`.

## Fix Strategy:
1. Revise the conditions in the `_get_with` function to properly handle non-list-like indexers, including scalars. We need to ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of indexers.
2. When encountering an indexer that is not found in the `Series`, raise a `KeyError` with a message stating that the indexer is not present in the index.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or (not is_list_like(key)):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function will handle different types of indexers consistently and handle cases where the indexer is not found in the `Series` properly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and make the failing test pass.
