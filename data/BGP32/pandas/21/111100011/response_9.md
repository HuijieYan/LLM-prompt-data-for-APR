### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of indexers.
2. The bug arises from the inconsistent behavior in handling list indexers as opposed to array-like indexers (e.g., series, arrays, Index) when they have no matches in the index. This inconsistency causes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug occurs when `key` is an object that is list-like and does not have matches in the index. The function currently does not handle the case of list indexers correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make the behavior consistent for all types of indexers when there are no matches in the index. We should ensure that the error message and handling are the same across all scenarios.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers correctly when there are no matches in the index.
2. Ensure that the error message for non-matching keys is consistent across all types of indexers.
3. Update the logic to match the behavior described in the GitHub issue, making the handling of list indexers consistent with other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers when no matches are found in the index. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub and makes the behavior uniform across all types of indexers.
