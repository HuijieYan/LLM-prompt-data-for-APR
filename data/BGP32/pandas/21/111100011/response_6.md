### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of key inputs like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, etc.
- The bug occurs when a key with no matches is passed as a list, leading to a `KeyError` because the behavior for list indexers is different from other array-like indexers.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking this behavior by passing a key list that has no matches in the series index, but the bug causes a `KeyError` to be raised instead of treating it like other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug causes inconsistency in the behavior of handling indexers. When a list key with no matches is passed, it raises a `KeyError` instead of treating it as with other array-like indexers like numpy arrays or pandas Index objects.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to make the behavior consistent for all array-like indexers, including lists.
- We should modify the code in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in the same way as other array-like indexers to prevent the `KeyError` when there are no matches in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list to handle the key as an array-like indexer

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Updated Explanation:
- I have modified the code to force the conversion of the key to a list before handling it further, ensuring that all array-like indexers, including lists, are treated consistently.
- By converting the key to a list early, the function should now handle lists in the same manner as other array-like indexers, preventing the `KeyError` when no matches are found in the index.
- This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the inconsistent behavior with list indexers.
