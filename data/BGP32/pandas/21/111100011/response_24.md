## Analysis:

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class within the `pandas/core/series.py` file is responsible for handling different types of keys passed for indexing a `Series`.
2. The buggy behavior occurs when a `key` that is a list is passed to the `ser[key]` operation, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent values.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check this behavior and expects a specific error message when using a list type key.
4. The root cause of the bug lies in the handling of different key types within the `_get_with` function, particularly when processing lists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different key types, especially lists, when indexing a `Series`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to handle list keys in a way that aligns with the other key types, minimizing the occurrence of `KeyError` when accessing values that do not exist.
2. Ensure that all types of keys, including lists, are processed correctly to provide the desired behavior and align with the expectations of the failing test.

## Bug Fix and Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Handle list and non-list indexing cases
    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

After applying this correction to the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class, the function should now handle list keys in a manner consistent with other key types, resolving the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing test.
