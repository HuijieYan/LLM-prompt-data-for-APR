### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, lists, etc.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates the inconsistency in behavior when using different indexer types like list, ndarray, Index, or Series with a Series object.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and other array-like indexers when accessing elements in a Series object.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises due to the inconsistent handling of different indexer types within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the function fails to handle list indexers properly, leading to a KeyError in some cases, as demonstrated by the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug and align the behavior of list indexers with other array-like indexers like ndarray, Index, and Series, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list indexers correctly by updating the logic in that section.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug and aligns the behavior for list indexers with other array-like indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to handle list indexers properly, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency in behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.
