## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the `key` is a list properly, leading to an inconsistency in behavior when indexing with lists compared to other array-like indexers.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking for the expected behavior when indexing with a list and a key that does not match any value in the `Series`.
3. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior between indexing with a list and other array-like indexers, highlighting the need for a consistent approach.
4. To fix the bug, we should update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers to provide consistent behavior.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from not handling the case of indexing with a list properly. This leads to differences in behavior when using a list as an indexer compared to other array-like indexers, resulting in inconsistency.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers similar to other array-like indexers. By updating the logic to properly interpret a list as an indexer, we can ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers using `ensure_platform_int(key)`, we can ensure consistent behavior when indexing with lists compared to other array-like indexers. This correction should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
