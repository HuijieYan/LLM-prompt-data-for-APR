## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is from the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
2. The function checks the type of the input key and performs different operations based on its type.
3. The issue arises when handling a key that is a list. This leads to a `KeyError` because the function does not handle list-like keys properly.
4. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects consistent behavior when passing a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series as an indexer to a Series. Currently, the behavior is inconsistent when using a list as an indexer.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` does not handle list-like keys correctly. When a list is passed as a key, the function does not process it properly, leading to unexpected behavior and causing a `KeyError`.

## Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should handle list-like keys in a consistent manner. We can update the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle lists by treating them similar to numpy arrays, pandas Index objects, or pandas Series objects.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list-like keys as arrays
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = np.asarray(key)

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        if key.ndim == 1:
            if key.dtype == bool:
                return self.loc[key]
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By treating list-like keys as numpy arrays in the corrected version, we ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers in the `Series` class, addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
