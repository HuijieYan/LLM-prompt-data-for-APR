## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys used to index a Series.
2. The error occurs when indexing with a list-like key that does not match any values in the Series index.
3. The bug causes an inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list compared to indexing with other array-like types, leading to a KeyError in the specific case of a list key that does not match any values in the index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of key inputs and handle the case where a list key does not have any matches in the index.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle the case when key is a list and doesn't match any values in the index
    if not any(k in self.index for k in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this fix, we explicitly check if any element in the list key matches the index values before attempting to index the Series. If none of the list elements are found in the index, a KeyError is raised.

This fix will ensure that consistent behavior is maintained across different types of keys in the `_get_with` function. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
