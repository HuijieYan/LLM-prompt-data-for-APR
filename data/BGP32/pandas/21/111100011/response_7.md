## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle various types of keys for the `Series` class.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys, where the function does not correctly handle the case of keys that are not found in the index.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` specifically tests the behavior of accessing a `Series` with a key that is not present in the index. The test expects a `KeyError` with a specific message when using a list, which is not consistent with the behavior when using other data structures as keys.
4. The cause of the bug is a mismatch in the behavior of the `_get_with` function when dealing with list-like keys compared to other data structures. The test case highlights this inconsistency, which is also mentioned in the corresponding GitHub issue.
5. To fix the bug, the `_get_with` function should be modified to handle list-like keys consistently by raising a `KeyError` with the correct message when the key is not found in the index.

## Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not self.index.is_unique:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        if len(self.index.intersection(key)) < len(key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the function now handles list-like keys by explicitly checking for non-matching keys and raising a `KeyError` with the correct message. This fix addresses the inconsistency highlighted in the failing test and aligns the behavior with user expectations.
