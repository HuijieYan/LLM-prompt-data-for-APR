### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library is supposed to handle different types of indexers but fails when passed a list-like key.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file reveals that using a list index results in a KeyError while other types of indexers do not.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.
4. The cause of the bug is the missing handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, which should be added to ensure consistency with other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is list-like and handle it appropriately to avoid the KeyError when indexing a Series with a list.
2. Ensure that the behavior for list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers to address the issues raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
``` 

By updating the `_get_with` function as described above, we ensure that list-like keys are correctly handled, leading to consistent behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers.
