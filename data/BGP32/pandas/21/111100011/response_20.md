## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, and Pandas-specific objects.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the `test_getitem.py` file is designed to check the behavior of indexing with keys that do not match any values in the Series.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated, specifically when using a list indexer.
4. The bug in the `_get_with` function is causing the test to fail due to incorrect handling of list indexers.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers when no matches are found.

## Bug Description:
In the `_get_with` function, the bug arises when handling list indexers that don't have any matching values in the Series. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to a KeyError being raised when attempting to retrieve non-existent values.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug and pass the failing test, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers when no matches are found. Specifically, we need to handle the case of list indexers without matching values by returning NaN values instead of raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key].reindex(self.index)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers more effectively when no matches are found, resulting in NaN values being returned instead of raising a KeyError. This change aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
