## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class in the pandas library is causing an issue with indexing when using list-like indexers.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing this scenario and expects consistent behavior when using different types of indexers.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between array-like and list indexers, and suggests aligning the behavior to the list case.
- The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indexing when the key is not found in the index.

## Bug cause:
- The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` treats array-like indexers differently from list indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior.
- Specifically, when the key is not found in the index, the function does not handle the case properly when using an array-like indexer, resulting in a KeyError inconsistency.

## Fix strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function treats all types of indexers consistently and handles the case when the key is not found in the index appropriately.
- We can simplify the logic to treat all indexers as list-like to align with the expected behavior and resolve the KeyError inconsistency.

## Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[self.index.intersection(key)]
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should behave consistently when using different types of indexers, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
