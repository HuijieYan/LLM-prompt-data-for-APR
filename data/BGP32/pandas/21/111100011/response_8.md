## Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
- The function checks the type of `key` and performs different operations based on the type.
- The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a `Series` with an object `key` that does not match any index values.
- The issue on GitHub points out the inconsistency between behavior of list indexers and other array-like indexers.

## Error Location:
- The bug is likely in the section where the `key` is checked for its type and then processed accordingly.
- Specifically, the issue arises when handling the case where `key` is a list.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when `key` is a list, the function incorrectly tries to index the `Series` using `loc[key]`, which causes a `KeyError` when the key does not match any index values.
- This behavior is inconsistent with how other array-like indexers are handled, where a `KeyError` is not raised in the same situation.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is a list similarly to how other array-like indexers are handled.
- Instead of directly using `loc[key]`, we should find a way to handle indexing for a list key so that it doesn't result in a `KeyError`.

## Updated Buggy Function (Correction):
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "list":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the correction above and handling the `key` when it's a list similarly to other array-like indexers, the function should now correctly index the `Series` without raising a `KeyError` as observed in the failing test case.
