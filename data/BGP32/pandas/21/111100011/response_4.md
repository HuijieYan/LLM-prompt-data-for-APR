## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when indexing with a `list` key, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to access an element not present in the index.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated, specifically the behavior for `list` indexers compared to other array-like indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to align the behavior for indexing with a `list` key to match the behavior with other array-like indexers.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that aligns the behavior for indexing with a `list` key to be consistent with other array-like indexers:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
            #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        # Convert a non-list-like key to a list to maintain consistency
        if not is_list_like(key):
            key = [key]
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        # Handle indexing with a list key
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This modification ensures that indexing with a `list` key now behaves consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the KeyError issue reported in the GitHub bug.

Once you update the `_get_with` function with the corrected version above, it should pass the failing test case provided.
