### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is responsible for handling different types of indexing operations on a `Series` object.
2. The function checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on the type of key.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when trying to access elements in a `Series` using a key that does not exist in the index.
4. The issue raised on GitHub indicates an inconsistency in the behavior of list indexers compared to other array-like indexers.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely in the following block of code inside `_get_with` function:
```python
if not is_list_like(key):
    return self.loc[key]
```
When using a key that does not exist in the index, the above block of code should raise a KeyError, as indicated in the failing test.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly treats a single-element key that does not exist in the index differently when it is a list compared to when it is an array-like type. This inconsistency leads to the incorrect behavior seen in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug and make the behavior consistent, we need to ensure that the key is treated the same way regardless of whether it is a list, numpy.ndarray, pandas Index, or Series. The logic in handling a key that does not exist in the index should be identical for all types of array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        # other: fancy integer or otherwise
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to handle all types of array-like indexers consistently, including lists, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
