## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` module.
2. The function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys to extract values from the series.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks for the correct behavior when accessing the series with a key that does not exist in the index.
4. The GitHub issue mentions the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing unexpected behavior and KeyError in some cases.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the `key` is converted to a list and then checked for its type. If the key is an `Index` object, the buggy function assigns `key_type` as `key.inferred_type`. Else, it assigns `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. The issue arises when `key` is a list object, as it would pass the first check for being an `Index` object and incorrectly set `key_type`, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly determine the type of `key` when it is a list. Instead of checking if the `key` is an `Index` object, we can directly check if it is a list and then proceed accordingly in the logic to handle the key. This adjustment will ensure that the correct type inference is used for a list `key`.

## Corrected Version of the Bug:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, list):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype([key], skipna=False)[0]

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating these changes, the bug in the handling of different key types within the `_get_with` function should be resolved. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue regarding inconsistent indexing behavior.
