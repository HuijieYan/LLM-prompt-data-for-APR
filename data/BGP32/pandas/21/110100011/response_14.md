## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The function is responsible for indexing and returning values based on different types of key input.
3. The bug occurs when indexing with a list-like key, causing a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access an element that is not present in the index.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between different types of indexers and how the list indexer raises a `KeyError` while others do not.
5. The bug needs to be fixed by handling list-like keys appropriately to prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The key improvement in the corrected version is the addition of appropriate handling for list-like keys to ensure that a `KeyError` is not raised when the key is not present in the index. This fixes the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.
