## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of keys and performing indexing operations on the series data.
2. The buggy function fails to handle the case where the key is a list in a consistent manner, which causes the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The cause of the bug is that when a list key is passed, the function incorrectly tries to treat it as an `Index` object, resulting in a `KeyError` when performing the indexing operation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a list key is passed, it is handled correctly as a list for indexing, rather than trying to convert it into an `Index` object.

## Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)
    
    if lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False) == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that when a list key is passed, it is directly used for indexing without conversion to an `Index` object.

With this fix, the `test_getitem_no_matches` test should pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
