### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a `Series`.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` within `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` is designed to test the behavior of indexing a `Series` with a key that has no matches in the index.
- The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in treating different types of indexers (such as list, array-like, and Index) when indexing a `Series`.

### Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. The case where key is a list is causing the KeyError in the failing test.
2. The conditional branches for handling different types of input keys can result in incorrect indexing behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the `_get_with` function not properly handling the case when the key is a list, leading to a KeyError when no matches are found in the index.
- The inconsistency in behavior between list, array-like, and Index when used as keys was noted in the GitHub issue, indicating a need for consistent handling.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys properly by using `self.loc` for indexing when no matches are found in the index.
- Ensure consistent behavior for different types of input keys to align with user expectations and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle the case when key is a list with no matches in the index
    if key_type == "mixed-integer" or key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Correction:
- The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now checks for the datatype inferred from the key input and uses `self.loc` for indexing when dealing with list-like keys that have no matches in the index.
- This approach ensures consistent behavior for different types of input keys and addresses the specific issue encountered in the failing test case.
