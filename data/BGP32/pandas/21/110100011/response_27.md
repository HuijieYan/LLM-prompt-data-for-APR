## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library.
2. The function contains multiple conditionals to handle different types of keys passed in for indexing.
3. The bug is related to how different types of keys are handled, especially when using a list key, which results in inconsistent behavior between different types of indexers.
4. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior of indexing using different types of key containers. It expects the same behavior for all types of key containers, but the bug causes inconsistency when using a list key.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers and the unexpected behavior when using a list key.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistency in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list key is passed, it results in a `KeyError` due to the way the function treats list indexers differently compared to other indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers passed to the `_get_with` function. Specifically, handling list keys should be aligned with the behavior of other indexers to avoid the `KeyError` issue.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Convert non-list-like keys to loc for consistent behavior
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Convert all key types to list for consistent treatment
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    return self.loc[key]
```

By converting non-list-like keys to `loc` for consistent behavior and unifying the treatment of different key types as lists, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
