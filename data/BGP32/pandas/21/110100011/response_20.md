In the provided buggy function `_get_with(self, key)`, the issue lies in the handling of different types of keys that can be passed to the function. Specifically, when `key` is a list-like object, the function is not handling it correctly, leading to a KeyError in some cases.

The root cause of the bug can be explained using the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` where a Series object `ser` is created with values ["A", "B"]. The `key` object is set to a Series containing ["C"] and is then converted to different types (list, np.array, Index, Series) using the `box` parameter. When the buggy `_get_with` function is called with these converted `key` objects, it should return NaN for the value "C", but for the case of a list-like key, it raises a KeyError instead, leading to inconsistency.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` passed to `_get_with` is a list-like object, it should be handled properly to avoid a KeyError. We will modify the function to explicitly handle list-like keys and return the expected behavior of returning NaN for missing values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle list-like keys properly to avoid KeyError
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        if isinstance(key, list):
            key = np.array(key)
        key = ensure_index(key)
        if key.is_integer():
            return self.reindex(key).fillna(np.nan)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modified version, the function now properly handles list-like keys, converts them into a numpy array, ensures the key is an index, and reindexes the Series while filling missing values with NaN.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided and resolve the GitHub issue related to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers.
