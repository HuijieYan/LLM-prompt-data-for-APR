## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, data frames, tuples, and various other data types.
2. The bug seems to occur when a list indexer is passed to the Series object, resulting in a KeyError exception when trying to access non-existent values.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses a Series object as an index key, which is converted to a list for testing purposes. The expectation is that a KeyError should be raised when trying to access non-existent values, but the current implementation is inconsistent.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the behavior of handling list indexers is consistent with other array-like indexers and raise a KeyError for non-existent values.
5. The corrected version of the `_get_with(self, key)` function is provided below.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
```

By modifying the logic when handling list indexers and introducing a final `raise KeyError` statement for non-existent values, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version ensures consistent behavior for different types of indexers and addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to indexing inconsistencies.
