### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, etc.
- The failing test function `test_getitem_no_matches` in the test file `test_getitem.py` checks the behavior of indexing using different types of indexers like lists, numpy arrays, Index, and Series.
- The identified issue from the GitHub bug report is related to the inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list of keys compared to other types of indexers.
- The current implementation of `_get_with` method does not handle the case of a list-like key appropriately, leading to the KeyError since the index does not contain the specified key.

### Error Location:
- The issue arises in the block where the function checks if the key is not list-like and attempts to return `self.loc[key]`. This approach is incorrect when dealing with a list key, leading to the Key error.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused due to the inconsistent behavior of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` method. When attempting to access elements with a list key, it does not handle the case properly, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic to handle list-like keys correctly in the `_get_with` method.
- Ensure that the behavior of indexing with a list of keys is aligned with that of other data types like numpy arrays, Index, Series, etc.
- Update the `_get_with` method to address the specific case of list-like keys appropriately.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating these changes, the corrected version of the `_get_with` method should now handle list-like keys appropriately, ensuring that the testcase `test_getitem_no_matches` passes successfully.
