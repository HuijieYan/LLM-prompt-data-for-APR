## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas.core.series.py` is responsible for handling different types of input keys and returning the corresponding values from the series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` uses different types of keys to index the series. The test is expecting consistent behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series as indexers.
3. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers when indexing a series. The issue refers to a specific example where `ser[list(key)]` raises a KeyError while other types like `pd.Index(key)` and `np.array(key)` do not.
4. The bug seems to occur due to the difference in treatment of list indexers in the `_get_with` function.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the conditional block handling the case where the key is not list-like. It incorrectly redirects to `self.loc[key]` which causes a KeyError when indexing with a list as the key.
- The inconsistency arises from not properly handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function.

## Fix Strategy:
- We should ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other array-like indexers in the function `_get_with`.
- Update the conditional logic to correctly handle the case when the key is list-like.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as highlighted above, we ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
