### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers when indexing a pandas Series object.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the test file provides a scenario where the function `_get_with` is expected to behave differently for different types of indexers.
- The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior of how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.
- The issue arises because the function is not handling the case of list indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs when a list indexer is passed to the `Series` object, causing the function to raise a `KeyError` instead of handling the list indexer gracefully.
- The issue is that the function does not correctly handle the case of a list indexer and tries to treat it the same way as other array-like indexers, leading to the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case when a list indexer is provided.
- We need to ensure that list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers to maintain consistency in behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        # Handle list-like and Index objects separately
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other array-like key types
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
- The corrected function now properly treats list-like key objects separately, ensuring that list indexers are handled correctly without resulting in a `KeyError`.
- This correction aligns the behavior of the function with the expected outcomes, fixing the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
