## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the appropriate values.
2. The bug seems to be happening when `key` is a list of values.
3. The test function `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking for the behavior when there are no matches in the index, and it expects a `KeyError` to be raised.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially when `key` is a list.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent behavior in the `_get_with` function when dealing with different types of indexers. Specifically, when `key` is a list, it should ideally raise a `KeyError` if there are no matches in the index, similar to the behavior when `key` is an array-like object. However, the current implementation does not handle the list case correctly.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the code in the `_get_with` function to handle the case when `key` is a list appropriately and raise a `KeyError` if there are no matches in the index. This alignment will ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):  # Check if key is list-like
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, Index):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

## Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now properly handles the case when `key` is a list by inferring the key type, checking if it's an integer, and reindexing accordingly. This fix ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
