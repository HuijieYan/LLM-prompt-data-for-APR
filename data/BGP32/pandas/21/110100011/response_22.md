## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method defined within the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`.
2. The purpose of the `_get_with` function is to handle different types of indexing keys when accessing values from a `Series`.
3. The bug is related to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers like arrays, indexes, or Series.
4. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to simulate this issue by triggering a `KeyError` with a specific message that reflects the inconsistency.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the discrepancy in behavior when using list indexers compared to other indexers types and questions the reasoning behind the difference.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function does not handle list indexers correctly. When a list indexer is passed, it is not reindexed properly causing a `KeyError` with a message indicating that none of the items in the list indexer are in the Series index. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are handled correctly in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is passed, it should reindex the Series based on the items in the list rather than triggering a `KeyError`. This change will align the behavior of list indexers with other types like arrays, indexes, and Series.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the issue with list indexers should be resolved. The function will now correctly handle list indexers by reindexing the Series based on the items in the list. This correction should align the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers as intended.
