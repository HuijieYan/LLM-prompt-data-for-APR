## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the pandas library.
2. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing a Series with different types of indexers (list, array-like).
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series with a key that does not exist in the Series, leading to a `KeyError`.
4. The bug occurs when handling indexers of type `list`, causing the `KeyError` in the failing test.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling indexers of type `list`. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` is used to identify scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`, but it does not handle list indexers properly, leading to the `KeyError` when attempting to access elements not present in the Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers correctly in the `_get_with` function. Instead of trying to directly access the indexer in the Series, we should check if any elements in the list indexer are not present in the Series index and raise a `KeyError` accordingly.

## Corrected Version of `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    # Handle list indexers correctly
    if isinstance(key, list):
        key_diff = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
        if key_diff:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key_diff} are in the index")
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes to the `_get_with` function, the bug should now be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test as reported in the GitHub issue.
