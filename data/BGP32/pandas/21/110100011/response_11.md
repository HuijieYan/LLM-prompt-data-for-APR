## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling various types of keys used to index a `Series` object. The bug occurs when a key of type `list` is passed, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` from the `test_getitem.py` file demonstrates the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a key of type `list`. It expects a `KeyError` to be raised with a specific message, but the current implementation does not throw the expected error.

## Error Locations
1. The `elif not is_list_like(key)` block is handling situations where the key is not list-like, but the behavior for lists specifically should be addressed separately due to the bug.
2. The nested `if isinstance(key, list)` block is ambiguous as it may trigger for list-like objects as well, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to inconsistent handling of list-type keys in the `_get_with` function. When a key of type `list` is passed, it should raise a `KeyError` indicating that none of the elements in the list are present in the index. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to explicitly handle the case when the key is of type `list` in a way that aligns with the expected behavior for other array-like keys. We should ensure that a `KeyError` is raised when none of the elements in the list key are present in the index.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not any(idx in self.index for idx in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if not any(idx in self.index for idx in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.reindex(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Default case when key is not recognized
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, when a key of type `list` is passed, it first checks if any element in the list is present in the index. If none of the elements match the index, it raises a `KeyError` with a specific message. The behavior for other array-like keys remains consistent with the existing implementation.
