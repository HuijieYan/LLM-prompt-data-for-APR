## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, data frames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and more.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when indexing with a key that does not exist in the series.
3. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in the behavior of indexing a series with different types of indexers, specifically focusing on the discrepancy between list indexers and other array-like indexers.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the `_get_with` function handles list-like indexers compared to other array-like indexers, resulting in a KeyError for list indexers in some cases.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, when using a list-like indexer that does not exist in the series, the function incorrectly throws a KeyError, which is not consistent with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This discrepancy leads to the failing test scenario where list indexers produce a different error compared to other array-like indexers.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior when handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should modify the logic for list-like indexers to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers. This will involve updating the conditional checks and error handling to provide a uniform response for all types of indexers.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):  # Update the condition for handling list-like indexers
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Remove the separate handling for list indexers to create uniform behavior
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, we aim to resolve the inconsistency in handling list-like indexers and other array-like indexers. This fix should align the behavior when indexing a series with different types of indexers, ensuring a uniform response to avoid the reported issue on GitHub and pass the failing test.
