## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class within the pandas library. The function is used for indexing operations based on the type of key provided. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is checking for consistent behavior when using different types of indexes, specifically `list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a `list` compared to other index types.

## Potential error locations:
1. The code block handling `list` indexes might have an issue causing the inconsistency mentioned in the GitHub issue.
2. The condition for detecting a non-list-like key could be causing unexpected behavior.
3. The reindexing block at the end might not be handling the index correctly.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the inconsistency in handling different types of keys, especially when using a `list` as an index. The function might not be correctly identifying a `list` index and therefore not behaving as expected.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles all types of keys consistently and specifically address the issue highlighted in the GitHub report regarding `list` indexes.
One approach could be to handle `list` indexes in a similar way to other index types.

## Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, we should ensure consistent behavior across all types of keys, including `list` indexes, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency in indexing behavior.
