## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is not handling the case when `key` is a list-like object correctly, leading to a `KeyError` exception. This issue is discussed in the provided GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches".

## Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations in the buggy function `_get_with` are when checking for `list-like` objects and handling them in the subsequent conditions.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of indexers when `key` is a list. As per the GitHub issue discussion, the behavior of `ser[list(key)]` should be consistent with other types of indexers like `pd.Index` or `np.array`. This inconsistency leads to the `KeyError` when accessing the elements that don't exist in the index.

## Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `key` is a list, it is handled in a way that is consistent with other array-like indexers. We should update the `_get_with` function to cater to this scenario and return appropriate values without raising a `KeyError`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we handle the case when `key` is a list-like object correctly, ensuring that the behavior is consistent with other array-like indexers. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
