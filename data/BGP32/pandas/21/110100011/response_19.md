### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and list-like objects.
2. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled within the function, specifically for list-like objects.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior when using a list-like object as an indexer, and it expects a KeyError with a specific message to be raised. However, the current implementation of the `_get_with` function does not handle list-like objects correctly, leading to an incorrect behavior and failing the test.
4. The bug seems to be caused by the inconsistent handling of list-like objects compared to other types of indexers within the `_get_with` function.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class to handle list-like objects correctly. Specifically, when receiving a list-like object as an indexer, it should check for the presence of elements in the index and raise a KeyError if none of the elements match.

### Corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            msg = f"None of {key!r} are in the index"
            raise KeyError(msg)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if not self.index.intersection(key).empty:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key!r} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that the function correctly handles list-like objects as indexers and raises a KeyError if none of the elements in the list match the index. This correction aligns with the expected behavior defined in the failing test and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
