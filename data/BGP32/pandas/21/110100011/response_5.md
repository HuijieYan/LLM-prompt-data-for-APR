### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, lists, arrays, etc.
2. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is specifically checking for the behavior when a key with no matches is provided to the `ser[key]` operation.
3. The root cause of the bug seems to be the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function, leading to incorrect behavior when a list key with no matches is provided.
4. To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent handling of different indexers and properly handle the case of no matches when a list key is provided.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different indexers in the `_get_with` function. When a list key with no matches is provided, the function incorrectly tries to index the Series with the list key instead of properly handling the case of no matches.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case of no matches when a list key is provided. We can update the function to check for no matches explicitly and raise a `KeyError` if no matches are found.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if not any(key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function to explicitly check for no matches when a list key is provided, we ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
