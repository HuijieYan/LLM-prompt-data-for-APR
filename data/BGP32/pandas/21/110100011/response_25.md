## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module is responsible for handling different types of indexers and retrieving values based on those indexers.
2. Among other implementations, the bug arises when trying to access a non-existing key using a list-like indexer. The expected behavior is to raise a `KeyError` with a specific message, but the current implementation fails to do so.
3. The test case that fails due to this bug involves creating a `Series` object, constructing an index key using different types like list, array, index, and series, and then trying to access a key that does not exist in the series.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistent behavior in handling different types of indexers and mentions that `ser.loc[key]` raises an error for all cases, except for the list-like indexer case.
5. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles the case of a list-like key that does not exist in the series and raises a `KeyError` with the appropriate message.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the key is a list-like object and not present in the series index.
2. Raise a `KeyError` with the correct message if the condition above is met.
3. Update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys as expected.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the condition to check for the key's existence in the series index and raising a `KeyError` if not found, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys appropriately and pass the failing test case.
