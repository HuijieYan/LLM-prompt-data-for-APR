## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` inside the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module has issues related to indexing using list-like objects.
2. The function contains conditional statements to handle different types of keys, but the handling for `list` key is causing the bug as reported in the GitHub issue.
3. The bug occurs because the function treats indexers differently based on whether they are list-like or array-like, leading to inconsistent behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of list indexers is consistent with array-like indexers to provide the expected behavior.

## Bug Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the `pandas.core.series` module, which addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the handling of list indexers to be consistent with array-like indexers, the corrected function now provides the expected behavior when indexing with objects like lists as reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
