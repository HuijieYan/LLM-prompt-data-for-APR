## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of input keys for indexing. The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, which is not being handled correctly and results in a `KeyError`. The bug is related to the inconsistent behavior of indexing with lists compared to other array-like indexers.

## Identified Bug
The bug is located in the part of the function where it checks if the key is list-like. The function is trying to handle a list index in a way that is causing a `KeyError` due to a mismatch with the index.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in how different indexers are handled. When a list key is passed to the function, it is not being processed correctly, leading to a `KeyError` exception. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other array-like indexers, causing confusion and issues.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the handling of a list index is consistent with other array-like indexers. We should modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list keys by reindexing based on the list elements.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list index
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle reindex for lists
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the above correction, the function `_get_with` now properly handles list-like keys by reindexing based on the list elements, making the behavior consistent with other array-like indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
