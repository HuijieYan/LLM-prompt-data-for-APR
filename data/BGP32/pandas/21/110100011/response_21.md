## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` within the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is supposed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like indexers compared to other types.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is expecting consistent behavior for different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) when used with a Series object, but it fails due to the inconsistency in the handling of list indexers.
4. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when using a list-like key, while other types of indexers work correctly.
5. The failing test is related to the GitHub issue about inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers in the `Series` class.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the location in the `_get_with` function where the bug occurs when dealing with list-like indexers.
2. Modify the logic to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner, similar to how other indexers are handled.
3. Ensure that the corrected function passes the failing test and aligns with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers consistently
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Handle other types of indexers
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with the logic of other types of indexers, addressing the bug reported in the failing test and GitHub issue.
