## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of keys for indexing a `Series` object. The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like type and an attempt is made to access the element using `self.loc[key]`. This leads to a `KeyError` in cases where the key does not exist in the index.

## Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when a key that is not list-like is passed. This triggers an attempt to directly access the key using `self.loc[key]`, which causes a `KeyError` if the key is not found in the index.

## Fix:
The bug can be fixed by checking for the existence of the key in the index before attempting to access it using `self.loc[key]`. If the key is not present in the index, a `KeyError` should be raised to handle cases where the key does not exist.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if the key exists in the index
    if key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")

    return self.loc[key]
``` 

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function checks if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it. If the key is not found, a `KeyError` is raised to handle this scenario.
