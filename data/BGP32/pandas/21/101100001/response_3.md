After analyzing the buggy function `_get_with`, I have identified the potential error locations:

1. The `key` variable is being transformed into a list regardless of its type.
2. The logic for checking the type of `key` and selecting the appropriate indexing method is not handling all cases correctly.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling different types of keys is not comprehensive and may lead to incorrect behavior when indexing a Series.

To fix this bug, we should update the logic for key handling to cover all possible scenarios and make sure the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is chosen based on the type of `key`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) or is_object_dtype(key.dtype):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we have added a check for `is_object_dtype(key.dtype)` to distinguish object type keys from other types. We also handled the case where `key` is not recognized as list-like and made sure to correctly select `loc` or `iloc` based on the key type.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
