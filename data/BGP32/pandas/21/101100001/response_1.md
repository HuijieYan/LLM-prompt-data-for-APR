## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is meant to handle various types of keys for indexing a `Series` object. The function currently has an issue where it doesn't handle `np.ndarray` objects correctly.

## Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when the key is not recognized as a list-like object (`is_list_like(key)` returns False), and it tries to treat it as a scalar for indexing. This results in incorrect behavior when a NumPy array is passed as the key, as NumPy arrays are not being recognized correctly.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the check for `is_list_like(key)` which fails to correctly identify NumPy arrays as list-like objects. It results in an improper fallback to using `loc` instead of handling the input key as an array.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional block handling non-list-like keys to correctly identify NumPy arrays. We should ensure that NumPy arrays are treated in the same way as lists or other indexable structures.

## Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function will now correctly handle NumPy arrays and other non-list-like objects, ensuring the expected behavior for indexing a `Series` object with various types of keys.
