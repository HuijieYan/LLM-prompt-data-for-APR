After analyzing the buggy function and its related functions, the key issue lies in the handling of the key parameter in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly handle the case where the key is not found in the index, leading to a KeyError.

The bug occurs when the key used to access the `Series` data is not present in the index. This situation is not being handled properly in the `_get_with` function, resulting in a KeyError being raised rather than a more informative message or action.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to handle cases where the key is not in the index. We can use a condition to check if the key exists in the index before attempting to access the data. If the key is not found, we can raise a more descriptive error message.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
            
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
            
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
            
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
            
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
            
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
            
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
            
        if any(k not in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index.")
            
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the `if any(k not in self.index for k in key):` check before attempting to access the data, we ensure that a KeyError is raised with a more informative message if any of the keys are not found in the index.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle cases where the key is not present in the index, preventing the KeyError from being raised and allowing the test cases provided to pass successfully.
