## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and related code, it seems that the bug lies in the `_get_with` function when handling cases where `key` is a list-like object. The current implementation tries to convert `key` to a list and then infer its data type. However, this approach does not consider the case where `key` is a list of objects, such as a Series object, and leads to incorrect behavior.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic to first check if `key` is an instance of a Series object. If it is, then directly use it for indexing on the Series. This will ensure that the correct behavior is maintained even when dealing with list-like objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, Series):
            return self.loc[key]

        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly handle indexing with list-like objects like Series. This correction should address the bug in the original implementation and ensure that the failing test case passes successfully.
