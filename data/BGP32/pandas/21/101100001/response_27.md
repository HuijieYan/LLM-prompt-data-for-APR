The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of key types. When `key` is of type `list`, it should check if the elements in the list are present in the index of the Series. Currently, it incorrectly assumes that all elements in the key list are valid indices.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if all(k in self.index for k in key):
            return self.loc[key]

    # If key is not list-like, check if it is a valid scalar
    if not is_scalar(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key {key} not found in index")

    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `key` is a list-like object. If it is, we then verify that all elements in the list are present in the index of the Series. If they are, we proceed with indexing using `loc`. If `key` is not list-like, we check if it is a scalar and then try to index using `loc`.

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test provided.
