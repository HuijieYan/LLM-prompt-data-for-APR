## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is supposed to handle different types of `key` inputs when indexing a Series. However, the current implementation has a bug where it incorrectly processes the `key` input leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

## Bug Identification:
The bug is identified in the condition block where it checks if `key` is not list-like. When `key` is not list-like, it tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to a KeyError if the key is not present in the index.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly assuming that accessing `self.loc[key]` for a non-list-like `key` will always be valid. This leads to a KeyError when the key is not present in the index.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition block for non-list-like keys to handle the KeyError situation. We can also simplify the handling of scalar keys and unify the behavior for different types of keys.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

After implementing these modifications to handle non-list-like keys and scalars properly, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases provided.
