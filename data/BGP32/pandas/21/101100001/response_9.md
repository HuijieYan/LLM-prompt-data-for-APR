### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the key is a list-like object properly. Specifically, when `key` is a list, it attempts to treat it as an `Index` object and get the `inferred_type`, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the section of the code where the type of `key` is being inferred to determine how to handle indexing. When `key` is a list, it should be treated differently.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of lists in the `_get_with` function. When `key` is a list, it is mistakenly treated as an `Index` object instead of processing it as a list.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the code to properly handle list-like objects when determining the type of `key`.
- Check for list-like objects before checking for `Index` objects.
- Remove unnecessary conversion of list-like keys to `Index` objects.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, the issue with handling list-like objects is resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test cases.
