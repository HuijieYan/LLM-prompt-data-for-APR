After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, it seems that the bug is due to the condition where the key is not recognized as list-like, and it falls back to using `self.loc[key]`. This results in a `KeyError` when trying to access an element that is not in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not recognized as list-like differently. We can modify the buggy function to properly handle this scenario without triggering a `KeyError`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles cases where the key is not recognized as list-like by checking if it's a scalar and accessing using `loc` if needed. This modification should resolve the `KeyError` that was occurring and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test.
