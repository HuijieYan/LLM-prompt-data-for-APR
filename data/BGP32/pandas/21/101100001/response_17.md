The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the way it handles the `key` parameter. In the case where `key` is a list, it attempts to convert it to a `list` again which is unnecessary. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant check for `list` and `np.ndarray` types and directly proceed to check if it is an instance of `Index` or if it should be treated as a positional indexer. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version eliminates the redundant type checks and directly goes on to process the key based on its type and properties. By removing unnecessary type conversions and adding the `key_type` check, we ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the type of the input key.

Running the failing test cases after applying this correction should result in the tests passing successfully.
