The bug in the `_get_with` function is that when `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, it tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to a KeyError when the key is not found in the index. To fix this, we can add a check to see if `key` is present in the index before trying to access it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or (is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index):
        # Raised a KeyError when key doesn't exist in the index
        raise KeyError(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check to ensure that a KeyError is raised if the key is not found in the index. This change should rectify the issue identified by the failing test.
