### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is not handling the case where `key` is a single value that is not recognized as a list-like object correctly. It tries to access the value using `self.loc[key]`, which can lead to a KeyError if `key` is not found in the index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused when the `key` is a non-list-like single value that is not recognized as a valid key. The buggy function does not handle this case properly and directly tries to access the value without considering the scenario where the key might not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `key` is present in the index before trying to access it.
2. If the key is not present in the index, raise a KeyError.
3. Handle the case where `key` is a single value that is not list-like.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):  # Handling non-list-like single values
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to index if not already

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes a check to ensure that non-list-like single values are handled properly, thereby avoiding the KeyError issue when the key is not found in the index.
