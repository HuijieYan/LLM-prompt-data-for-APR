### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series object.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with keys that do not match any values in the index.
- The key passed in the failing test is eventually converted to a list for indexing.

### Issues:
1. The key is converted to a list, but then different logic branches are executed based on the type of the key, leading to inconsistency in behavior.
2. The function fails to handle the case where the key is not found in the index properly, resulting in a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic to handle list-like keys consistently, ensuring that the behavior is the same when indexing with lists, arrays, Series, etc.
2. Ensure proper handling of cases where the key is not found in the index to avoid KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled consistently and adds a try-except block to gracefully handle cases where the key is not found in the index.

By making these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
