## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, data frames, tuples, and lists.
2. The bug arises when processing a list indexer where the function attempts to determine the `key_type` using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`, which wrongly classifies the type as "integer" for string-type keys like "C".
3. This misclassification leads to incorrect handling of the key, causing a KeyError because the key is not found in the index.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle list indexers correctly by updating how the `key_type` is inferred and then appropriately index into the Series.
5. By ensuring correct type inference and indexing based on the type of key provided, we can resolve the KeyError issue.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
        raise KeyError(f"{key} not found in the index")
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

By modifying the `_get_with` function to correctly handle list-like keys and scalar keys that are not identified properly, the bug causing the KeyError should be resolved. The updated version considers scalar keys directly and handles list-like keys by using `self.loc[key]`. This approach ensures that the function behaves consistently with all types of indexers provided.
