The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how list indexers are handled differently from other array-like indexers such as Index, ndarray, or Series. When a list indexer is passed, the function tries to convert it into a key_type to determine the type of indexing operation to perform. However, the conversion for list key types ends up incorrectly identifying the key_type as `"integer"` when it should use positional indexing instead.

To fix the bug, we should update the logic for handling list key types to ensure that the correct indexing operation is chosen based on the input. In this case, since a list indexer is not recognized as an integer indexer, it should default to positional indexing (iloc) instead of attempting to use label-based indexing (loc) incorrectly.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]  # Use positional indexing

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]  # Use positional indexing for list key types

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle list indexers by defaulting to positional indexing (`iloc`) for better consistency with how other array-like indexers are treated. This change should address the bug described in the failing test cases and align with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue.
