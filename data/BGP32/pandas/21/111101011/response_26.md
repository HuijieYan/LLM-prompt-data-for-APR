## Bug Analysis

### 1. Buggy Function
The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is intended to retrieve values from the Series object based on the provided key. It contains conditional branches to handle different types of keys such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Index objects.

### 2. Potential Error Locations
- The issue may be related to the handling of different types of keys, specifically the conversion of keys to lists and the subsequent inference of the key type.
- The incorrect handling of non-matching keys in the list or array-like indexers can lead to a KeyError when attempting to access non-existing values.

### 3. Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically the difference in behavior between list-based indexers and other array-like indexers. When using a list as the key to access values from the `Series` object, a KeyError is raised instead of returning NaN for missing values. This inconsistency is highlighted in the provided failing test, where the KeyError is raised for list-based indexers.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the behavior of list-based indexers should be aligned with other array-like indexers to return NaN for missing values instead of raising a KeyError. This will address the inconsistency and provide the expected behavior across different types of indexers.

### 5. Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to a list for consistent processing

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By converting the key to a list for all cases and ensuring that missing values are handled consistently across different indexers, the corrected `_get_with` function should address the bug and pass the failing test related to list-based indexers.
