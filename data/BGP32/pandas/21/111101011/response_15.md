### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is incorrectly handling different types of key input. The issue arises when a list is used as the key to index a `Series`, resulting in inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers like arrays or `Index` objects. The bug causes a `KeyError` to be raised when trying to access an element that is not in the `Series` using a list key.

The issue is related to the discrepancy in handling different types of key inputs, especially when a list is used. The bug causes inconsistency in behavior and contradicts the expected behavior based on other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function handles list indexers consistently with other types of indexers. By adjusting the conditional checks and logic inside the function, we can address the issue of treating list indexers differently.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Handle the case of list-like key
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, thereby resolving the inconsistent behavior and the `KeyError` issue observed in tests.
