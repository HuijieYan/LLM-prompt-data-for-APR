### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. However, it fails to handle the case when the key is a list-like object correctly, resulting in a KeyError. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of indexers are handled, causing the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to how the function handles list-like keys. When the key is a list, the function incorrectly tries to treat it as a single scalar value and attempts to locate it in the index. This causes a KeyError because the list itself is not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. Instead of treating the list as a single value, we should iterate over the elements of the list and perform indexing based on each element. This way, we can align the behavior with other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        results = [self.loc[k] for k in key]
        return self._constructor(data=results, index=key)

    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By iterating over the elements of the list key and fetching the corresponding values using `self.loc[k]`, we ensure that each element is properly handled during indexing, resolving the KeyError issue. This correction aligns the behavior of list-like indexers with other types of indexers in the function.
