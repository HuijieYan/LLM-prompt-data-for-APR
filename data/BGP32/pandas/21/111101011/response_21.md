### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling key types like lists or arrays. In the cases mentioned, the key being passed is not properly processed, leading to a KeyError when trying to access the index. The issue stems from the implementation differences in handling list indexers compared to array-like indexers. In the failing test case, when a list key is passed, it results in an incorrect behavior that triggers a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior in handling all types of keys, including lists and arrays, to avoid the KeyError. One approach is to modify the key handling logic to properly process the list key the same way as other array-like indexers. By addressing this inconsistency, we can align the behavior and resolve the KeyError issue.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected `_get_with` function with an updated key handling logic:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_object_dtype(key):
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed"]:
        if self._index.get_indexer(key).max() == -1:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the [index]")
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key handling logic to check for object_dtype and ensuring consistent treatment of different key types, we can address the bug and pass the failing test cases. This fix aligns the behavior for handling list, array, and other key types consistently, resolving the KeyError issue.
