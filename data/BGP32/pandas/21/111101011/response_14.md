The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of indexers are handled, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function fails to properly handle the list indexer case, leading to a KeyError in certain scenarios.

The issue arises when passing a list indexer where the elements in the list are not found in the Series index. The function incorrectly processes the list indexer, resulting in the KeyError because it fails to check for the existence of the elements in the index before indexing the Series.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers by checking if the elements in the list are present in the Series index before indexing. If any element is not found in the index, we should raise a KeyError to match the behavior of the other indexer types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Check if all elements in the list are present in the Series index
        if any(x not in self.index for x in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```

By adding the check to verify if all elements in the list indexer are present in the Series index, we ensure that accessing a Series with a list indexer behaves consistently with other indexer types and avoids the KeyError in this scenario.
