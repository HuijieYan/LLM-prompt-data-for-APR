### Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when dealing with different types of indexers such as arrays, lists, and indexes. The bug leads to inconsistency in behavior when using list indexers, resulting in a KeyError that should not be raised.

The bug is caused by the condition where if `key` is not list-like, the function attempts to access `self.loc[key]`. This condition is incorrect because it includes `Index` and `Series` instances, which should be handled differently. This inappropriate handling leads to the KeyError when dealing with list indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition for non-list-like keys to exclude `Index` and `Series` instances.
2. Implement separate handling for `Index` and `Series` instances to ensure correct behavior.
3. Refactor the code to handle each type of key appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key.to_list()]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle different types of keys appropriately, avoiding the KeyError issue when dealing with list indexers. This fix should align with the expected behavior and resolve the inconsistency raised in the GitHub issue.
