### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is failing to handle the case where the input key is provided as a list. The function incorrectly processes the key and fails to retrieve the correct values, leading to a KeyError in some scenarios.

In the failing test case, the input key is a Series converted to a list or array, and when passed to the `ser[key]`, it should return `NaN` for values not present in the index. However, due to the bug in the `_get_with` function, it is raising a KeyError instead.

The root cause of the bug lies in how the function `_get_with` handles the key parameter when it is not considered list-like. It incorrectly tries to index directly based on the key without considering the type of the key which can be problematic in the case of non-matching values.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like input keys and return `NaN` for values not present in the index, aligning with the correct behavior expected in the failing test case. Additionally, we should ensure that the function handles the key types correctly to prevent KeyError exceptions for non-matching values.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(list(key))

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle list-like keys, return `NaN` for non-matching values, and avoid raising KeyErrors for such cases. This fix aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case and resolves the issue highlighted in the associated GitHub problem statement.
