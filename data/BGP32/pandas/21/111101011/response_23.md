## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle list indexers correctly. The issue arises when a list is provided as the key input parameter, causing a KeyError when trying to access the data using `ser[key]`.

The main cause of the bug is the inconsistent treatment of list indexers compared to other types like ndarray, Index, and Series. The bug manifests when attempting to access a Series using a list key, resulting in a KeyError due to the non-matching behavior of list indexers.

## Solution
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers to align with the behavior of other array-like indexers. By ensuring that list indexers are processed correctly, we can eliminate the KeyError when accessing a Series using a list key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes additional handling for list indexers to ensure consistency with ndarray, Index, and Series indexers. By aligning the treatment of all array-like indexers, the bug causing the KeyError for list indexers should be resolved.
