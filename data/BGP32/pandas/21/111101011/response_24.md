## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of indexers to retrieve values from a Series object. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to test how an indexer (key) that does not match any values in the Series index is handled.

The bug seems to be related to how list-like indexers are treated differently from other types of indexers, causing inconsistency in behavior. The failing test case uses various box types (list, np.array, pd.Index, pd.Series) to test the behavior, and it fails specifically when a list-like key is used.

In the failing cases, the inferred key type is set to `'string'`, which suggests that the key type is not correctly identified as an index-like object, leading to the KeyError when trying to access the key from the Series.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function that treats different types of indexers differently. When a list-like key is encountered, it is not correctly processed, leading to the KeyError when trying to access the key from the Series.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `_get_with` function needs to be revised to handle list-like indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers. Specifically, when a list-like key is encountered, it should be processed correctly to avoid the KeyError.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

With this corrected version, the function should now handle list-like indexers consistently with other indexers and pass the failing test cases.
