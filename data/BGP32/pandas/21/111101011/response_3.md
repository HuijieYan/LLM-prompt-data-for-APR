### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is designed to handle different types of indexers, but it fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is designed to check the behavior of indexing with different types of indexers, such as lists, ndarrays, Index objects, and Series objects.
3. Based on the provided runtime values and types, the function fails to correctly handle the list-like key, resulting in an incorrect `key_type` being determined as `'string'`.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers like arrays or Index objects.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers in the `_get_with` function, which does not correctly process list indexes.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are properly handled in the `_get_with` function to prevent the KeyError. We should align the behavior of list indexers with other types of indexers (arrays, Index objects, etc.), as requested in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if not is_scalar(key):
            key = list(key)
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these modifications, the function should now correctly handle list-like indexers and align the behavior with other types of indexers, which should resolve the KeyError issue mentioned in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
