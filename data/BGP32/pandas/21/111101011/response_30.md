After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue arises from the handling of different types of indexers (such as lists, arrays, indices) within the `_get_with` function. The function fails to handle certain types of indexers correctly, leading to a KeyError in cases where list indexers are used.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list indexer is provided, it should be properly processed to avoid the KeyError that is currently occurring.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the `key` is converted to an Index type using `ensure_index(key)` before further processing. This ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers and prevents the KeyError that was previously occurring.

By using this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the failing test cases should pass without any issues.
