Following the analysis of the buggy function, it seems that the issue stems from the handling of different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) in the `_get_with` function. The problem arises when the key type is identified as "string" but the function attempts to perform indexing based on this incorrectly inferred type.

To address this issue and align the behavior with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue, we can modify the code to handle all indexers consistently. We should specifically address the case where the key type is incorrectly identified as "string" and adjust the indexing approach accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should fix the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle various indexers
    key = ensure_index(key)
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes explicit handling of different types of indexers, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the input type. It also addresses the issue of incorrectly identifying the key type as "string" and adapts the indexing approach accordingly.

By implementing these changes, the corrected `_get_with` function should pass the failing test and resolve the inconsistency described in the GitHub issue.
