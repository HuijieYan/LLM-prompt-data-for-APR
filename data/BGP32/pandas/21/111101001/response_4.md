The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable, leading to incorrect indexing behavior and ultimately causing the test cases to fail.

The issue lies in the logic related to determining the `key_type` based on the input `key`. In all the cases mentioned, the `key_type` is incorrectly assigned as `'string'` instead of `'object'` or `'integer'`, which leads to the wrong path being taken in the subsequent code execution.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` input. If the `key` is an integer, it should be correctly identified as an integer type, and the corresponding index access method should be invoked.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if isinstance(key, (int, np.integer)):
            key_type = "integer"
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correctly identifying the `key_type` based on the type of the input `key`, this corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test cases.
