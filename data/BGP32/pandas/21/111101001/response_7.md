The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key when it is not recognized as a list-like structure. The function currently tries to access the key using `self.loc[key]`, which leads to a `KeyError` in cases where the key is not present in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to handle keys that are not list-like in a more appropriate way. We can modify the function to first check if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        if key in self.index:
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} is not in the index")
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case
            return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function will first check if the scalar key exists in the index before attempting to access it, preventing the `KeyError` that was occurring before. This change ensures that the function correctly handles keys that are not list-like structures.
