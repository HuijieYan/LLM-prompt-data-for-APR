### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not correctly handling the case where the input `key` is a list-like object that is not recognized as a list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. This leads to an incorrect branch being taken in the code, resulting in unexpected behavior and the failing test.

In the failing test, the key `key` is initially a Series containing the value "C", and it is then converted into different types such as list, numpy array, pd.Index, and pd.Series. The buggy function is not able to correctly identify this as a list-like object and fails to handle it appropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to properly handle the case where the `key` is a list-like object that falls outside the recognized types. We can modify the code to check if the key is recognized as any of the expected types, and if not, treat it as a list.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(list(key))  # Treat unrecognized key as a list
```

By adding the final `else` block to handle unrecognized keys as a list, we ensure that all list-like objects that are not covered by the previous conditions are treated as lists for reindexing, resolving the bug and allowing the function to pass the failing test.
