### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is encountering an issue when the `key_type` is being determined. Based on the provided runtime values, the `key_type` is always being inferred as `'string'`, which results in the function incorrectly trying to handle the key as a string, leading to the KeyError.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function checks the type of the key:
   - If it's not list-like, it tries to access the key directly using `self.loc[key]`.
   - If it's list-like but not of certain supported types (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index), it converts it to a list.
   - If the key type is inferred as 'integer', it decides whether to treat it as positional or label-based indexing.
2. In the provided runtime cases, the `key_type` is always inferred as a 'string' instead of the expected types like 'integer', leading to incorrect handling of the key.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred. Since the `key_type` is incorrectly being inferred as 'string', we should review the code segment that infers the `key_type` and determine why it is always being set as 'string'. We need to investigate the `lib.infer_dtype` and `index.inferred_type` methods that are used to determine the `key_type`.

### Corrected Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function with the potential fix for the bug:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of key provided, which should resolve the issue causing the KeyError in the failing test.
