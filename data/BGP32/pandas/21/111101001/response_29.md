The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from an incorrect type check in the `if not is_list_like(key):` block. The current implementation assumes that if `key` is not list-like, it should be treated as a scalar and accessed using `self.loc[key]`. However, in Case 1, `key` is a list `['C']`, which triggers this conditional branch erroneously.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the type check to properly differentiate between scalars and non-list-like sequences. We should treat non-list-like sequences as an index or positional indexer rather than as a scalar value. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.reindex(key)

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle different types of inputs such as lists, arrays, indices, and yet maintain the desired behavior for scalars. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
