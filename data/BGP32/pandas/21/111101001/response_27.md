### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not recognized as a list-like object. In the current implementation, when `key` is not list-like, the function attempts to access the `key` value from the `self.loc` attribute. However, in certain cases, this results in a `KeyError` because the `key` value does not exist in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle non-list-like `key` values more effectively. Instead of directly attempting to access the `key` value from `self.loc`, we can check the type of `key` and take appropriate actions to avoid potential `KeyError` exceptions.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not valid for direct access from loc
    if not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' not found in the index")

    # Logic for handling list-like keys
    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check for non-list-like keys and raises a `KeyError` with a meaningful message to handle cases where the key is not present in the index. Additionally, the function flow has been adjusted to prevent direct access to non-list-like keys that may cause the `KeyError`.
