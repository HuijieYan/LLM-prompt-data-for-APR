## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key's type, resulting in a KeyError when trying to access an element not present in the Series index. The key_type inference is comparing the key with the type "integer" when it should handle cases where the key is not present in the index gracefully.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic that determines how to handle the key based on its type. We should first check if the key is present in the index before trying to access it directly. If the key is not present in the index, we should raise a KeyError to handle missing values appropriately.

## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is present in the index
    if key in self.index:
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        raise KeyError(f"'{key}' not found in the index")
```

By adding the check `if key in self.index`, we ensure that the key exists in the Series index before trying to access it. If the key is not found, a KeyError is raised to handle missing values correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test cases provided.
