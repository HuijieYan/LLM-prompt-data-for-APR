### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when the function encounters a key that is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar. In this case, the function attempts to access the key in a way that is not appropriate for the given input, leading to a KeyError during execution.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar properly. We can modify the code to handle this scenario by checking if the key is a scalar before attempting to access it. If the key is not list-like and not recognized as a scalar, we can return an appropriate error message or raise an exception to indicate that the key cannot be accessed in the current context.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key {key} is not valid for indexing")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should be able to handle the case where the key is neither list-like nor recognized as a scalar correctly, avoiding the KeyError that occurred previously.
