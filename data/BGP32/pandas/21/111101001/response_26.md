## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of non-list-like keys. When the key is not list-like, the function attempts to access the `loc` attribute of the key directly, assuming it is a valid indexer. However, this leads to a KeyError because the key is not suitable for direct indexing.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for non-list-like keys to ensure proper handling. We should check if the key is a scalar and then try to access the `loc` attribute. If the key is not a scalar, we can raise a TypeError indicating that the key is not supported.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    raise TypeError("Invalid key type for indexing")
```

With this fix, the function will correctly handle non-list-like keys, preventing the KeyError and ensuring proper error handling.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
