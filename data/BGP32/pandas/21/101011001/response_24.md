### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle various types of input `key` values for indexing a Series.
2. The error occurs when indexing a Series using different types like list, ndarray, Index, or Series.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the input key types within the function, leading to a KeyError during indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different key types in the `_get_with` function. When indexing a Series with a key of type list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the function fails to properly select the correct indexing method, leading to a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles indexing with different types of keys like list, ndarray, Index, or Series. By checking the type of key and selecting the appropriate indexing method accordingly, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ["integer", "string", "boolean"]:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version includes additional checks for scalar keys and properly differentiates between integer, string, and boolean key types to select the appropriate indexing method. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring during indexing, addressing the bug.
