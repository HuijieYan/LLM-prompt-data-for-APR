### Problem Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing because the key input may not always be a list, numpy array, Pandas Index, Series, or ExtensionArray, causing the function to incorrectly interpret the key_type. This leads to the function attempting to perform indexing operations with incorrect assumptions about the key_type.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs when the key is not converted correctly to a valid type for indexing. This is evident in the failing test cases where different types of `key` values are passed to the function. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type`, leading to incorrect indexing operations.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` input is correctly converted to a valid type for indexing. We should handle various input types properly to avoid incorrect inferences about the `key_type`. Additionally, the logic for selecting between `iloc` and `loc` needs to be refined.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            key = ensure_index(key)
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `key` is converted to a list if it is not list-like. Then, we handle different types of keys correctly to determine the `key_type` and perform the indexing operation accordingly. Additionally, we ensure that the decision between `loc` and `iloc` is made based on the key_type and the index's fallback behavior. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected with different types of input keys.
