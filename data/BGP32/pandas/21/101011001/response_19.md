### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to how it handles the key when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. Based on the error messages and the provided runtime values, it is evident that the issue arises when the key is being used to index the Series but does not match any values in the Series' index, leading to a `KeyError`.

Looking at the code, the key is checked for its type and further actions are taken based on that type. When handling a key that is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, the code incorrectly infers the dtype of the key as `'string'`, which is not appropriate handling for the key and leads to the KeyError.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of keys that are lists, ndarrays, Index objects, or Series objects. The code is incorrectly inferring the dtype of the key as `'string'`, which is causing it to fail when trying to index the Series based on this incorrect dtype.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the key's type is being inferred and handled for list, ndarray, Index, or Series objects. We should check the key's type and structure correctly so that it can be used to index the Series without issues like KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing Series")
```

Fixing the way the key's type is handled based on its structure and type should resolve the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test cases.
