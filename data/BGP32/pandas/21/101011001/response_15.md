### Bug Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs in a `Series` object.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the `key` input when it is a list-like object.
- The function correctly identifies when `key` is not a list-like object and calls `self.loc[key]` in that case.
- However, when `key` is a list-like object, the function tries to handle it in different ways based on its type, which leads to the bug.

### Bug Explanation
- When `key` is a list-like object, the function should handle it consistently, either by using `self.loc[key]` or by reindexing based on the list.
- The bug occurs because the function tries to infer the type of `key` and handle it differently based on that inference, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we should simplify the handling of list-like `key` objects in the function to ensure consistent behavior.
- Instead of inferring the type of `key` and handling it differently based on the type, we should treat list-like objects uniformly by either using `self.loc[key]` or reindexing depending on the type of `key`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By simplifying the handling of list-like objects in the function and ensuring consistent behavior, the corrected version should now pass the failing tests.
