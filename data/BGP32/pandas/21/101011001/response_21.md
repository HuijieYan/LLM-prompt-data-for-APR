The bug in the `_get_with` function stems from incorrectly handling the key input parameter. The function tries to identify the type of key and perform corresponding operations based on that type. However, the logic for identifying the key type and performing operations is flawed, leading to the KeyError in the failing test cases.

The key issue arises from the condition:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```

In the above condition, if `key` is an ndarray or a Series instance, it gets converted to a regular list, losing its original type information. Consequently, the subsequent logic based on `key_type` fails to handle the converted list properly, resulting in the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to preserve the type information of `key` and modify the logic accordingly. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_array = np.asarray(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_array, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first convert `key` into a numpy array `key_array` to retain the type information. We then use `key_array` to infer the dtype correctly, ensuring that the subsequent logic handles the key appropriately based on its type.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle the different types of key inputs correctly and pass the failing tests without raising a KeyError.
