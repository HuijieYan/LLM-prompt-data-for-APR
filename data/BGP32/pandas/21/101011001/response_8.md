### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object (`key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series) that contains a value not present in the Series index. The buggy function checks if the key is an integer, boolean, or a specific type before attempting to access the data. However, it does not handle the case where the key is list-like and contains values not present in the Series index.

### Bug Explanation
When the key is a list-like object that includes a value not present in the Series index, the buggy function incorrectly assumes the key is of type `'integer'` and tries to return data based on positional indexing. This causes a KeyError to be raised because the key with a value not in the index cannot be found.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is list-like and contains values not present in the Series index. Instead of assuming the key is of type `'integer'`, we should handle list-like keys that contain non-index values separately to prevent KeyError.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, pd.Series)):
        key = np.asarray(key).flatten()

    if len(set(key).intersection(set(self.index))) != len(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Some items were not found in the index: {set(key) - set(self.index)}")

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, we first convert the key to a NumPy array and flatten it if it's a pandas Index or Series. Then, we check if any items in the key are not present in the Series index. If there are missing items, we raise a KeyError specifying the missing items. This way, we ensure that the key only contains valid index values before proceeding with indexing the Series.
