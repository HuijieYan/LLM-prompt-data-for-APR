### Bug Analysis
1. The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is called with different types of keys, such as a list, an ndarray, an Index, or a Series. The bug leads to a KeyError exception not being raised correctly when indexing the Series object.
2. The key_type variable is determined incorrectly as a 'string' instead of 'object'.
3. This bug is likely due to incorrect type inference for the key in the `_get_with` function, leading to improper handling of the key when indexing the Series object.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly determined and handled when indexing the Series object.
   
### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the inference of the key type and ensuring proper handling of different key types, the corrected function should now handle indexing correctly and pass the failing tests.
