### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when handling a key that is a list-like object. The function erroneously assumes that the `key` is always a list-like object if it's not an instance of an `Index`, but this assumption leads to incorrect behavior when processing the key.

### Bug Explanation
The root cause of the bug lies in the logic for handling different key types. When the key is not recognized as an `Index`, the function incorrectly treats it as a list-like object. This approach is incorrect because a key that is not an instance of an `Index` can be of various types, not necessarily a list-like object. This misuse of the `is_list_like` function leads to incorrect indexing and triggers the `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to improve the logic for distinguishing between different key types. Instead of assuming that a key not being an `Index` is a list-like object, we should check the key's type more accurately to determine the appropriate indexing method. 

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_value = np.asarray(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_value, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list-like object
    if is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function incorporates a better check for the key type before deciding the appropriate indexing method. It handles cases where the key is not an instance of an `Index` more accurately, preventing incorrect assumptions and resolving the issue that caused the `KeyError` in the failing tests.
