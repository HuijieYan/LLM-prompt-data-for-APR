### Analysis:
- The buggy function `_get_with` is handling various types of keys, including slices, data frames, tuples, and list-like objects.
- The bug seems to be related to the handling of the key when it is not recognized as a list-like object.
- The bug is causing a `KeyError` to be raised in the failing test cases because the key is not properly handled.
- The variable `key_type` is incorrectly determined as `'string'` in all failing test cases, which indicates that the logic for inferring the key type is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely occurring because the logic to determine the key type and handle different types of keys is not properly implemented. This incorrect handling leads to the function not returning the expected output when a key that is not recognized as list-like is used.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect key type inference and handling in the function. We should ensure that the key type is correctly determined and that the function takes appropriate actions based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key = key.to_list()

    return self.loc[key]
```

By ensuring that the key is treated correctly based on its type, the corrected version of the function should now handle various key types properly and avoid the `KeyError` that was causing the failing test cases.
