### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is intended to handle different types of `key` inputs, including slices, DataFrames, tuples, and other types.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles list-like input keys, as indicated by the failing tests.
3. Looking at the buggy function's implementation, it seems that the handling of different key types is not comprehensive, leading to the KeyError when indexing with a list-like key.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like keys by returning `self.loc[key]` for such cases.
5. Additionally, we should ensure that the function correctly handles Index objects by extracting `key_type` from the index and using it to determine the indexing method.

### Bug Fix
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
 
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the function as proposed above, the bug related to handling list-like keys should be fixed, and the failing tests are expected to pass.
