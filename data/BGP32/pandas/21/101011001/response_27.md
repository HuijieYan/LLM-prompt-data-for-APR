### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter. The function expects `key` to be a list or an ndarray, but in some cases, it could be passed as a Series or an Index object. This inconsistency leads to the function incorrectly inferring the `key_type` as a string, causing the subsequent logic to fail and raise a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key` parameter is always converted to a list before proceeding with the logic in the function. This will handle cases where `key` is passed as a Series or an Index object. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is properly inferred based on the input `key`.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that `key` is consistently a list and inferring the `key_type` correctly, the corrected function should now handle different input types accurately and no longer raise a `KeyError`.
