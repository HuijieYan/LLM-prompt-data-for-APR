### Analysis and Explanation:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The issue arises when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, causing an error during indexing.

From the failing tests and the runtime values, we can see that the key passed to the function is of different types (list, ndarray, Index, Series). The function should treat these input types consistently but fails to do so due to how it handles the key's type.

The key_type is incorrectly assigned as 'string' in all cases, which indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the type of the key passed for indexing. This leads to faulty branching logic, causing the KeyError to not be raised as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the key passed for indexing and handles it appropriately. We should aim to treat list, ndarray, Index, and Series types consistently within the function to avoid errors and raise the KeyError when necessary.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = key.values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle ndarray and Series types by converting them to their values before inferring their dtype. Additionally, we ensure that the key is treated consistently regardless of its type, making the function more robust and eliminating the KeyError issue.
