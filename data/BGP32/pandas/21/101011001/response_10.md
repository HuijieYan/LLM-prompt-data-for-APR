### Bug Analysis:
The bug occurs when the function `_get_with` is called with an input `key` that is not recognized correctly. The function aims to handle various types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, numpy arrays, Series, and Index objects.

However, the bug arises in the section where the function tries to determine the `key_type` based on the input `key`. The issue lies in the comparison `if key_type == "integer"`, where the function incorrectly assigns `'string'` as the `key_type`. This erroneous assignment leads to the function's incorrect behavior when deciding whether to use label-based indexing (`self.loc`) or positional indexing (`self.iloc`).

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the identification of the `key_type` based on the input `key`. We should ensure that the correct type is inferred for the key before proceeding with the logic that depends on this type. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By ensuring correct type inference for the `key` variable, the corrected version of the function should now handle the different types of keys appropriately and pass the failing tests.
