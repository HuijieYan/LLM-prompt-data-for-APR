### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to the handling of non-list-like input keys.

1. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 4, the input key is a single element (string 'C'). The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'`.
   
2. The function tries to decide whether to treat the key as a positional indexer or a label-based indexer. However, it's not correctly handling non-list-like keys.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we should correctly handle non-list-like input keys by allowing the function to handle single elements as labels. If the key is not list-like, we should treat it as a label-based indexer.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (str, int)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we handle non-list-like keys separately and use them directly for label-based indexing using `loc`. This approach ensures that single elements are treated as labels and not mistakenly inferred as integers.
