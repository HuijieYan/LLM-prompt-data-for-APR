### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when the input `key` is not recognized as list-like or scalar but is passed as a `Series` object. In this case, the function currently tries to retrieve the values using `self.loc[key]`. However, this approach leads to a KeyError because `key` is not appropriate for indexing the Series.

### Bug Explanation
In the provided cases, the issue arises when the input `key` is not a list-like object, an ndarray, or an extension array, but instead, it is a `Series` object. The current function implementation does not handle this case correctly, resulting in a KeyError during indexing with `self.loc[key]`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `key` is a `Series` object before attempting to access the values with `self.loc[key]`. 

One way to approach the fix is to convert the `Series` object `key` into a list of values before proceeding with the indexing. This conversion will ensure that the indexing operation is valid and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert to a list
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        key = key.tolist()  # Convert Series to a list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including the conversion of a `Series` object into a list before the indexing operation, the corrected function should handle the edge case where `key` is a `Series` and avoid the KeyError that was previously occurring.
