### Bug Analysis
The bug is related to how the function `_get_with` handles different types of `key` inputs. The function incorrectly assumes that if `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, it should be treated as a label-based indexer (`self.loc[key]`). This assumption is incorrect and leads to a `KeyError` because the key is not found in the index. This issue arises when `key` is an unexpected type like an `Index` or a scalar object.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of `key` inputs more effectively. We should not assume that if `key` is not list-like, it should be treated as a label-based indexer without proper checks.

### Corrected Implementation
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of different types of `key` inputs and ensures that the key lookup operation is accurate and does not result in `KeyError` exceptions for unexpected key types.
