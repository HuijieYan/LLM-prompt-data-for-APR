### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect determination of the `key_type` when processing different types of `key` inputs. In the provided test cases, the key is a list containing the string 'C', but the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as 'string' instead of 'object'. This leads to the wrong path being taken in the function and eventually causes a `KeyError` due to the incorrect assumption made based on the key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the `key_type` based on the input `key` type. Since the key in all failing test cases is a list of objects, we should ensure that the inferred `key_type` matches this type. By correctly identifying the `key_type`, we can then follow the appropriate path for data retrieval, resolving the issue and passing the failing tests.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "object":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to correctly infer the `key_type` and handle object-type keys properly, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing tests provided.
