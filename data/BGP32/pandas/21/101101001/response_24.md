### Bug Explanation
In the `_get_with` function, the bug occurs when the input `key` is a list-like object that is not recognized as a list or numpy array, which leads to incorrect logic for indexing the Series. The bug is specifically manifested in the section where it differentiates between handling the key based on its inferred type. In the failing test cases, the key has an inferred type of 'string', but the logic in the function doesn't correctly handle this case, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling the key input based on its inferred type. We will make sure to correctly handle cases where the key has an inferred type of 'string' and appropriately index the Series based on that.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Correct handling for key_type == "string" case
    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific handling condition for when the inferred type of the key is 'string', we can now address the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly in such situations.
