## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type in certain cases. The function incorrectly infers the key type as `'string'` even when the key represents an index that is not present in the Series, leading to a KeyError during indexing. This behavior causes the failing test cases to raise an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and handled to prevent KeyError exceptions. We can modify the logic to properly identify the key type and then decide whether to use positional or label-based indexing based on the key type.

## Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle various types of keys and prevent KeyError issues during indexing, ensuring that the failing test case passes successfully.
