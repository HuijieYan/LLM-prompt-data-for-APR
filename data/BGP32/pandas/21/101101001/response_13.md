The bug in the provided function `_get_with` is that when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function is trying to access the location `self.loc[key]` directly. This results in a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `key` is not list-like before attempting to access `self.loc[key]`. We can modify the function to check if `key` is list-like before proceeding with the indexing operation.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list if it's not list-like
        
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if `key` is list-like and converting it to a list if necessary, we can ensure that the indexing operation using `self.loc[key]` will not result in a KeyError.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases provided.
