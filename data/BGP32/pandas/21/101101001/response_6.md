The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the condition where the key type is checked and processed. The issue arises when the key is not recognized as a list-like object, causing the function to attempt to access the key directly through `self.loc[key]`, resulting in a KeyError since the key is not present in the index.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not list-like correctly. We can convert non-list-like keys into a list before performing further operations. By doing this, we ensure that the key is handled consistently and avoids unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that non-list-like keys are correctly converted into a list before further processing.

After applying this fix, the function should handle the input correctly and pass the failing test cases.
