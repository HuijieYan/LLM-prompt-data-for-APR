The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` variable and its type inference. Based on the provided runtime values and types, it is evident that the key type is always inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for determining the type of the `key` variable and handle different scenarios accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing")
```

In this corrected version:
- We first check if the key is a scalar using the `is_scalar` function.
- If the key is a scalar, we directly use `self.loc[key]`.
- If the key is not a scalar, we proceed with inferring its type and handling the cases accordingly.
- If the key is of an unsupported type, we raise a `TypeError`.

This updated logic should address the bug by correctly inferring the type of the `key` variable and responding to different scenarios appropriately.
