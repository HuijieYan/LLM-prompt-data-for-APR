The bug in the `_get_with` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of the key type when it is a list-like object. The function incorrectly checks if the key is an instance of `list`, but it should handle other list-like objects as well. This leads to a misclassification of the key type, resulting in incorrect logic for indexing the Series.

To address this issue, we can modify the key type check to include all list-like objects, not just instances of `list`. We can also simplify the logic for determining the key type to improve clarity and accuracy.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'boolean']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes handling all list-like objects, using `ensure_index` to ensure a consistent format for the key, and distinguishing between cases of 'integer', 'boolean', and 'string' key types for appropriate indexing operations.

Please update the `_get_with` function in your code with this corrected version to fix the bug.
