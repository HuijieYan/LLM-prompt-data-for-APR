The buggy function `_get_with` has a bug related to the handling of the key_type variable. The bug arises from incorrect inference of the key_type, leading to incorrect behavior in determining whether to use positional indexing (iloc) or label-based indexing (loc).

Looking at the provided runtime cases, we can see that the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'` in all cases, which is not a valid type for determining the indexing strategy. This incorrect inference of key_type is causing the function to fall into the wrong path of decision-making.

To fix this bug, we need to improve the inference of the key_type based on the actual data type of the key variable passed to the function. Since key can be of various types, such as list, ndarray, Index, etc., we need to handle each case properly to determine the appropriate key_type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the key is a scalar using `is_scalar` function from the imports. Then based on the key type, we correctly infer the key_type using `lib.infer_dtype` function. This approach ensures that the key_type is correctly determined based on the actual data type of the key variable, fixing the bug in the function.
