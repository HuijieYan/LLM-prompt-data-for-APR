The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect inference of the `key_type`, which leads to incorrect behavior in selecting the elements.

### Bug Explanation:
In the provided cases, the function fails to correctly identify the data type of the key being used for indexing. When the key is a list with string values or a Series object, the function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'`, which is not a valid case handled further down in the function. This leads to the function taking the wrong indexing path and returning incorrect results.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly infer the data type of the key being used for indexing. We should ensure that the correct type inference is done for different types of keys, such as a list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index. By identifying the key type accurately, we can choose the appropriate indexing method (loc or iloc) or perform reindexing based on the key's type.

### Corrected Version:
Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == 'boolean':
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- We use `ensure_index` to standardize the key if it's not already an Index object.
- We correctly infer the data type of the key using `lib.infer_dtype`.
- We handle integer and mixed-integer types separately to decide between loc and iloc indexing.
- We also explicitly check for 'boolean' key types before applying loc indexing.
- Finally, we return the result of reindexing for other types of keys.
