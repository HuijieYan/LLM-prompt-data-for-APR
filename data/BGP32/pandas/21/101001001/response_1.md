The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of keys passed to the function. The function is designed to select values from a Series based on the key provided, but it fails to handle some cases properly.

Based on the given runtime input/output values for different cases, the buggy function fails when the key is a list of strings, numpy array of strings, or an Index object with string data type. In all these cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'` leading to the faulty behavior.

The issue lies in the data type inference process carried out by the `infer_dtype` function when determining the `key_type`. In the cases mentioned above, the data type is not being inferred correctly, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to address the incorrect data type inference. One way to do this is to improve the data type inference mechanism or modify the logic to handle string data types specifically. We should ensure that the `key_type` is correctly identified as `'string'` for string-based keys.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
        if key_type == 'string':
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking for `'string'` type specifically in the `Index` condition, we ensure that string keys are correctly handled and indexed in the Series. This approach resolves the bug and ensures proper functionality of the `_get_with` function for string-based keys.
