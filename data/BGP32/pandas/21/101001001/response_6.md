The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series, but it has a bug that causes it to treat all keys as if they were of type 'integer', leading to incorrect results.

The bug stems from the following block of code:
```python
if key_type == "integer":
    if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key]
```

The bug arises because the condition `if key_type == "integer":` incorrectly assumes that the key type is always 'integer', and based on this assumption, it proceeds to decide between using `loc` or `iloc` for indexing. This approach is incorrect as it might categorize keys of other types incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic needs to be updated to correctly determine the type of the key being used for indexing. The key type should be inferred based on the actual type of the key rather than assuming it is always 'integer'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = 'other'

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key type is correctly inferred based on the actual type of the key provided for indexing. This modification ensures that the function handles different types of keys appropriately and selects the correct indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) based on the key type.
