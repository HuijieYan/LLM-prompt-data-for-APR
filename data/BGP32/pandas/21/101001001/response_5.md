### Bug Analysis:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect assignment of `key_type` based on the type of input `key`. The function proceeds with different actions based on the inferred `key_type`, but the inference logic is flawed and does not accurately determine the type in all cases. This leads to incorrect behavior and potential errors when handling the `key`.

### Bug Explanation:
1. **Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3:**
   - The function incorrectly assigns `'string'` to `key_type`, regardless of the actual type of `key` provided. As a result, the function proceeds based on the incorrect type inference, leading to potential errors or undesired behavior.
  
2. **Case 4:**
   - In this case, the issue persists, where `key_type` is assigned `'string'` incorrectly, affecting the decision-making process based on the inferred type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is accurately inferred based on the type of `key` provided. Since the current inference logic is faulty, we should modify the logic to correctly determine the type of `key` and adjust the behavior accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `key_type` is properly inferred based on the type of `key` at the right locations, ensuring accurate decision-making and handling of different types of keys.
