The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the `if key_type == "integer"` block. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle cases where the `key_type` is identified as an integer, leading to the wrong indexing method being applied.

The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the handling of integer-type keys is done correctly by distinguishing between positional and label-based indexing. We can achieve this by checking the data type of the key and appropriately using `iloc` or `loc` for indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_integer(key) and not is_list_like(key):
            if self._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = list(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the check for integer types and the correct use of `iloc` or `loc` based on the index type directly within the function, the bug in handling integer keys should be resolved.
