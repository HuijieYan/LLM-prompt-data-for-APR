The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from treating the key as a scalar when it is actually a list-like object, resulting in the incorrect identification of the `key_type` as a string rather than a list. This leads to the function reaching the wrong branch of the conditional statements and causing unexpected behavior in the execution.

To fix this bug, we need to correct how the function handles list-like objects in the key parameter. We should ensure that the key is treated appropriately as a list or ndarray to get the correct `key_type` inference. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version properly handles list-like objects in the key parameter, ensuring that the `key_type` inference is accurate and leads to the correct behavior in the function.
