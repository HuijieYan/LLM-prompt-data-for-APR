The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of different types of keys provided for indexing a Series. The function fails to differentiate between the types of keys properly, leading to errors in indexing.

The key issue here is that the function does not handle string keys correctly, resulting in assigning the incorrect type `'string'` to `key_type`. This causes the function to enter the `if key_type == "integer"` block incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key type is correctly identified and processed. We should modify the function to properly handle the case when a string key is provided.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle non-list-like and non-Index keys
    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should handle different types of keys appropriately and avoid the misclassification of the key type. It should now correctly identify string keys and handle them accordingly, resolving the bug in the function.
