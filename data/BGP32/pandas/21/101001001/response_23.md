## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key type. When the key is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to determine the type of the key using `lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)`. In some cases, this does not correctly infer the type, leading to an incorrect branch in the code execution.

In the provided runtime cases, the key type is always inferred as `'string'`, which is not an expected type for the key. This leads to the function taking the wrong path and returning the incorrect result.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way we handle the key type checking in the `_get_with` function. Instead of relying solely on the inference of the key type, we can directly check if the key is an instance of specific types that we expect. This will ensure that the correct code path is followed based on the actual type of the key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, the function now directly checks if the key is a scalar before proceeding with the logic. This change ensures that the correct code path is followed based on the actual type of the key, avoiding the incorrect inference of the key type.
