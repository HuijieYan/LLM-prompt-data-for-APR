The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the input `key`, leading to the wrong determination of `key_type`. The function mistakenly identifies the type as `'string'` in all cases, which does not accurately reflect the actual type of the `key` input.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `key_type` is accurately determined based on the type of the `key` input provided. Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the input `key` provided. By using the `lib.infer_dtype` function, the function accurately determines the type of the `key` input and proceeds with the appropriate actions. This fix should address the bug and improve the function's behavior in handling different types of input keys.
