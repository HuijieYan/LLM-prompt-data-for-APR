Based on the buggy function and the failing test provided, the bug occurs when using the list-like key parameter in the `_get_with` method of the `Series` class. The function does not handle list-like keys properly, leading to a `KeyError`. The bug is related to how list indexers are treated differently from array-like indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` might not properly handle list-like keys.
2. The branch that occurs when `key` is not recognized as list-like, where `self.loc[key]` is used, may be causing the bug.

### Cause of the Bug:
When using a list-like key to index a `Series` object, the `_get_with` method is not properly handling this case. The incorrect handling of list-like keys leads to a `KeyError`, which violates the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Refactor the `_get_with` method to properly handle list-like keys by ensuring that all types of input indexers produce the same behavior. Update the logic for handling list-like keys to align with the behavior of other indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

The corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list-like keys by converting them to a list format before further processing, ensuring consistency in behavior across all types of indexers.

This fix should address the bug and align the behavior of list-like keys with that of other indexers in the `Series` class, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
