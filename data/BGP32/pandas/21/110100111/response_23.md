### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers when accessing a Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are processed and how the `KeyError` exception is raised.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of accessing a Series object with an index key that does not match any existing index values.
4. The issue on GitHub points out the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, specifically mentioning the `list` indexer behavior.
5. The expected behavior is that all types of indexers should behave consistently when accessing a Series object with no matching index values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by treating different types of indexers inconsistently in the `_get_with` function. The `KeyError` exception is raised for the `list` indexer case when no matches are found, while other types of indexers do not raise an exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and that the behavior aligns with the expected output from the failing test. Specifically, the `list` indexer should not raise a `KeyError` exception when no matches are found.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == 'integer':
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle all types of indexers consistently and pass the failing test that checks for the behavior with a key that does not match any existing index values.
