## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the pandas library has an issue when dealing with different types of indexing methods, specifically when a list indexer is used. The bug is identified through a failing test case in the `test_getitem_no_matches` function, where an error is raised for the list indexer while it works fine for other types like ndarray, Index, and Series.

### Potential Errors:
1. The code snippet `return self.loc[key]` for non-list like key might raise an error due to invalid indexing for non-existing keys.
2. The treatment of `key_type` based on the type of the key might not be comprehensive for different key types.
3. The conditional logic involved in deciding between positional and label-based indexing might lead to inconsistent behavior due to missing cases.
4. Handling of `list` as an input key type might raise errors related to indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes inconsistent behavior in indexing for different types, leading to errors when using a list as an index key. The code logic does not handle list indexers properly, resulting in a KeyError during the test case execution.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexing methods, especially when dealing with lists. Adjust the conditional checks and logic flow to handle list indexers correctly and avoid errors during indexing operations.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    
    if key.inferred_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments in the function, it should now handle list indexers correctly and provide consistent behavior across different types of indexer inputs.
