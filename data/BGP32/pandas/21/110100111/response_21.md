## Analysis
- The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in the `pandas/core/series.py` file.
- The function handles different types of keys (slice, DataFrame, tuple, non-list-like keys, etc.) to perform indexing on a Series object.
- The bug arises when dealing with list-like keys, as the function incorrectly tries to handle them in a specific way that leads to a KeyError.
- The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` passes different types of keys to the `ser` Series object and expects a KeyError to be raised in case the key is not found in the index.
- The expected error message states that none of the index values are found in the key passed.
- The GitHub issue highlights a discrepancy in behavior when using list-like indexers compared to other types of indexers, leading to inconsistency in error handling.

## Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because when dealing with list-like keys, the function tries to convert the key into a list assuming it's not already a list, which leads to incorrect behavior in the indexing process.
- Due to this incorrect conversion and handling, the function fails to locate the key values in the index, resulting in a KeyError being raised erroneously.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- The key issue lies in the incorrect handling of list-like keys. We need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly processed without any unnecessary conversions that might lead to errors.
- Specifically, the code where the key is converted to a list (`key = list(key)`) should be revised to handle list-like keys appropriately.
- We should also ensure that the key is processed properly based on its type to maintain consistency in indexing behavior.

## Corrected Version
```python

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that list-like keys are handled correctly without unnecessary conversions and maintains consistency in indexing behavior across different types of keys.
