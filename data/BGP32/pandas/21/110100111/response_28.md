After analyzing the buggy function `_get_with()` and the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, we can identify potential error locations in the handling of different types of key inputs, especially when dealing with list-like key inputs.

The bug occurs when the key input is a list-like object and the function tries to handle it without proper identification. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access non-existing indexes. The issue is related to inconsistencies in handling different types of key inputs, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we should ensure consistent behavior for all types of key inputs. We need to modify the function to properly handle list-like key inputs and avoid KeyError by correctly reindexing the Series.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with()` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes checks for list-like key inputs and handles them appropriately by reindexing the Series. It ensures consistent behavior for all types of key inputs and avoids the KeyError issue observed in the failing test.

By updating the `_get_with()` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`.
