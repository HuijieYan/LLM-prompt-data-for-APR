### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` library is responsible for handling different types of indexers and returning the corresponding values from the series.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of `key` when it is passed as a list-like object, causing inconsistent behavior compared to other types of indexers like arrays and indexes.
3. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` expects a `KeyError` when trying to access elements not present in the series using a list-like `key`.
4. The root cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of list-like `key` in the `_get_with` function, leading to the unexpected behavior.
   
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the type of `key` first before processing it.
2. If `key` is list-like, convert it to a list and proceed with the required operations.
3. Update the logic to handle list-like `key` in a consistent manner with the other types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list if not list-like

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function as shown above, the bug related to the inconsistent handling of list-like indexers should be fixed, and the function should now return the expected results for all types of indexers, including list-like ones.
