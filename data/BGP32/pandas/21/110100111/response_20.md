## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The bug arises specifically when a list-like key (e.g., list, ndarray, Index, Series) is passed, resulting in a KeyError due to misinterpretation of the key type.
3. The key type is incorrectly inferred as "string" in all cases, leading to incorrect indexing behavior.
4. The bug is related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.
5. The bug causes a KeyError to be raised when indexing with a list-like key, while the correct behavior should align with other indexer types.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that all list-like keys are properly handled for indexing.
2. Correctly infer the key type to determine the appropriate indexing method (loc or iloc).
3. Make the behavior consistent for list-like keys similar to other indexer types.
4. Update the function logic to differentiate between different key types and select the appropriate indexing strategy.
5. Implement proper error handling and indexing based on the inferred key type.

## Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type inference logic and handling list-like keys correctly, the corrected function will now index Series objects consistently with different types of indexer inputs. This fix aligns with the expectations outlined in the failing test cases and resolves the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
