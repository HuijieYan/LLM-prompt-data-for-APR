### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of keys passed to a `Series` object.
2. The function checks the type of the key and performs different actions based on the type. It is failing to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly.
3. The bug causes the function to raise a `KeyError` when a list-like key is passed, despite the expectation that it should return a result similar to other types of keys.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are processed correctly and do not raise a `KeyError`.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to inadequate handling of list-like keys within the `_get_with` function.
- When a list-like key is encountered, the function incorrectly attempts to perform a lookup using `loc` directly, leading to a `KeyError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the handling of list-like keys to align with the expected behavior.
- Ensure that list-like keys are properly processed and do not cause a `KeyError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # Correct handling for list-like keys
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list-like keys to use `loc` instead of directly returning a key, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly process all types of keys, including list-like keys, without raising a `KeyError`. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
