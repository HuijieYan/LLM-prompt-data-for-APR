### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key parameter, which results in an incorrect behavior for certain types of input.
3. Based on the failing test case, when the key is a list or an ndarray, the function raises a KeyError, indicating that none of the key values are in the index, which is incorrect.
4. The bug originates in the logic that determines the `key_type`, leading to incorrect indexing operations based on the key type.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the key type determination and subsequent indexing operations in the `_get_with` function of the Series class.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the provided key input.
2. Ensure consistent behavior for handling different key input types to avoid the KeyError issue.
3. Adjust the indexing operations based on the key type to return the correct values.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Determine key type based on input
    if isinstance(key, (Index, ABCSeries)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle integer indexing
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle other types of keys
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the key type determination logic and adjusting the indexing operations based on the key type, the corrected function should now behave correctly for the provided test cases and resolve the KeyError issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
