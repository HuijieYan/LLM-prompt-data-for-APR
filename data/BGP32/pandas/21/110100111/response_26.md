## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` within the `Series` class in the file `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling various types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The buggy function fails when it encounters a key that is not recognized as a list-like object and attempts to index `self.loc[key]`.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the behavior for different indexer types (`list`, `ndarray`, `Index`, `Series`) to be consistent, but the current implementation does not handle non-list-like keys properly, leading to a `KeyError`.
4. The expected input values and types mentioned in the failing test cases are critical to ensure that the corrected function behaves as expected.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior for different types of indexers, especially the treatment of list indexers, and suggests aligning the behavior to be more consistent across different indexer types.

## Bug
The bug arises when a key that is not recognized as a list-like object is passed to the function. This leads to an incorrect handling of the key, causing a `KeyError` as the function attempts to use `self.loc[key]`, assuming the key to be present in the index.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and address the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue:
1. Check if the key is not recognized as list-like before processing it.
2. If the key is not list-like, handle it appropriately to avoid the `KeyError`.
3. Ensure that the behavior for different types of indexers is more consistent.
4. Refactor the key handling logic to handle non-list-like keys correctly.

## Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version includes a check for non-list-like keys and handles them by reindexing the Series object appropriately. By addressing this issue, the function should now pass the failing test case and align the behavior for different indexer types, making it more consistent.
