## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` handles various types of key inputs such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, and more.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the key input which is a list. It results in a KeyError when trying to index using a list key.
3. The bug stems from the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are handled, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including list indexers, are handled consistently and do not raise errors.

## Bug Cause
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. When the key input is of type list, the current implementation does not handle it correctly and leads to a KeyError.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list indexers to ensure consistency with other types of indexers. We should treat list indexers similar to array-like indexers to prevent KeyError.

## The Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the handling of list indexers and converting them into a list type, we ensure that all types of indexers are processed consistently, thereby fixing the bug. This corrected version should pass the failing test and eliminate the KeyError issue when indexing with a list key.
