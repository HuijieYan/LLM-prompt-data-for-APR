### Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is part of the `Series` class in `pandas/core/series.py`.
2. The function is responsible for indexing and returning values from the series based on the provided key.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling different types of key inputs, especially when the key is a list of non-matching values.
4. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to verify the behavior when passing a key with no matching values, highlighting the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of keys.
5. Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems the bug is related to the different behaviors when using a list as a key compared to other types like Index, ndarray, or Series.
6. The bug causes a `KeyError` when using a list key that does not match any values in the index, while other types do not raise the same error.

### Bug Description
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class when handling key inputs of different types. When a list key is provided that contains values not present in the series index, the function raises a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of other key types like Index, ndarray, or Series, which do not raise the error in the same scenario.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list key inputs in a way that is consistent with other key types. Specifically, when a list key contains values not present in the index, instead of raising a `KeyError`, it should return `NaN` values for those missing entries in the output.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should handle list keys by returning `NaN` for any non-matching values, aligning with the behavior of other key types. This fix ensures consistency in handling different types of keys in the Series indexing operation.
