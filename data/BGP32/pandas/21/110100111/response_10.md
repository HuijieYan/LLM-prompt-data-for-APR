### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas.core.series` module.
2. The function is responsible for handling various types of input keys and returning the corresponding values from the Series data.
3. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like keys such as arrays, Index objects, and Series objects. The bug is causing a `KeyError` to be raised when accessing a key that does not exist in the Series index.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that there is inconsistency in the behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling list-like keys to ensure consistency and prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a list-like key, and it tries to access the key from the Series. If the key does not exist in the Series index, a `KeyError` is raised. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of keys are handled, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like keys. Instead of raising a `KeyError`, we should handle the case when the key does not exist in the Series index. This can be achieved by checking if the key is in the Series index before attempting to access it.

### Corrected Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function based on the analysis and bug explanation:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):  # modified to handle non-list-like keys
        if not is_scalar(key) and key not in self.index:
            return np.nan
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if the key is in the Series index before accessing it, we prevent the `KeyError` from being raised and return `np.nan` if the key does not exist. This ensures consistency in handling list-like keys and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
