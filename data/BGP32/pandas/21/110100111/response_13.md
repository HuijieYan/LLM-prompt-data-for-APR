## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` module is responsible for handling different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, single values, lists, etc.
2. The bug is related to the handling of a list-like key parameter, which does not match an existing index in the Series, leading to a `KeyError`.
3. The bug occurs when the key is a list, and the function tries to convert it to a positional indexer, resulting in a `KeyError`. This behavior is inconsistent with other types of indexers.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is a list, it should be directly returned without attempting to convert it to a positional indexer.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the key is a list, and if so, return the reindexed values directly without further processing.
2. Ensure that the direct list indexing does not result in a `KeyError` when the values are not present in the Series index.

## Bug-free Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like key directly
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    # Handle other cases
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, it directly reindexes the Series when the key is a list-like object, ensuring that it does not lead to a `KeyError` when values are not present in the index. This correction addresses the bug mentioned and is aligned with the expected behavior.
