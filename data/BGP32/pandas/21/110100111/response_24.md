## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug seems to occur when the input key is of type list, causing an inconsistency in behavior compared to other types of input keys.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior for different types of input keys, including list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The expected behavior is to raise a KeyError if none of the key values are in the index.
4. The expected output for the failing test is to raise a KeyError with a specific message indicating that none of the key values are in the index.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the case where the input key is of type list. The function checks if the key is not list-like, falls back to `self.loc[key]`, which may not handle the list input correctly, leading to the KeyError being raised incorrectly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic for handling list input keys to ensure consistent behavior across all input key types.
2. Ensure that the function correctly raises a KeyError with the appropriate message when none of the key values are found in the index.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        if key not in self.index:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With the corrected version, the function should now handle list-like input keys correctly and raise a KeyError with the expected message when the key values are not found in the index. This fix should address the inconsistency in behavior observed with list input keys.
