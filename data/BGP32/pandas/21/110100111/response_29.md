## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of `pandas` is meant to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the series object.
2. The bug occurs when dealing with a list-like indexer, where it fails to handle it correctly and raises an error instead of returning the expected values.
3. The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other types of indexers, as mentioned in the GitHub issue. The function should be updated to handle list-like indexers properly to align with the expected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list-like indexers to return the correct values from the series object as expected.

## Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalars that are not recognized as is_list_like
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # Handle list-like indexers correctly
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `if` block related to list-like indexers, the function should now correctly handle list indexers and return the expected values from the series object for all index types. This change aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
