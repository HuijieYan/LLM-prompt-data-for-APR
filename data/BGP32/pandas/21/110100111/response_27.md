## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, arrays, and Series.
2. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles non-existent values in the index when passed as a list key.
3. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` expects the function to raise a `KeyError` when trying to access a value that does not exist in the Series. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly when a list key is provided.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when a non-existent value is passed as a list key, a `KeyError` is raised consistently across all types of indexers.
5. The bug is related to inconsistencies in handling list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when a non-existent key is passed as a list indexer, the function does not handle the error properly and attempts to access the key directly instead of raising a `KeyError`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for handling list indexers to raise a `KeyError` when a non-existent key is accessed. This way, the behavior will be consistent across all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # Handle non-existent values being accessed
    if isinstance(self.index, (Index, RangeIndex)):
        missing_keys = [k for k in key if k not in self.index]
        if len(missing_keys) > 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {missing_keys} are in the index")
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle cases where non-existent keys are accessed using list indexers and raise a `KeyError` as expected.

This fix ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers when accessing non-existent values in the Series.
