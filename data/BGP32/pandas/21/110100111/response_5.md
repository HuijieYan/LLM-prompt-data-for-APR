### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is meant to handle different types of indexers and return the corresponding values from the Series.
2. The bug occurs when the input `key` is a list, and it is not handled correctly leading to a KeyError.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of list-like indexers within the function. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` uses a Series object `key` converted to different types of index-like objects (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and the expected behavior is consistent across these types. However, when the key is a list, the function fails to return the correct value and raises a KeyError instead.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the `key` is a list, it is handled correctly by returning the values corresponding to the list elements from the Series.

### Proposed Fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fix, the function now correctly handles list-like indexers and returns the expected values from the Series.

This correction should resolve the KeyError raised when a list-type key is provided as input. It aligns the behavior for list, ndarray, Index, and Series types of indexers, as expected in the failing test case.
