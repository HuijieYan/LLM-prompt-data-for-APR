### Steps to fix the bug:

1. Analyzing the buggy function, `._get_with`, we see that it handles different types of indexers such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, lists, and more to retrieve values from the Series.
2. The bug is likely in the part of the function that processes the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object.
3. The bug manifests itself in failing to handle list indexers correctly, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to access non-existent indices.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of list-like indexers in the function.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if all(is_scalar(x) for x in key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

### Explanation:
- The updated function now correctly handles list-like indexers by directly using `self.loc` on them.
- The check for `is_list_like` helps identify list-like objects, and they are handled appropriately by calling `self.loc[key]`.
- The function ensures that all types of indexers are processed correctly to avoid the `KeyError` issue observed in the failing test.
- By returning `self.loc[key]` for non-list-like indexers, we can retrieve the values as expected.
- This correction aligns with the request in the GitHub issue to make all indexers behave consistently.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now handle list indexers correctly and pass the failing test associated with the bug.
