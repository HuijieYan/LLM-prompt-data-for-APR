The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other indexers. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly and raises a `KeyError` exception in specific scenarios.

### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series.
2. The bug occurs when handling a list key, leading to inconsistencies with other types of keys.
3. The failing test case expects a `KeyError` to be raised when indexing with a list key but is not handled correctly in the current implementation.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the different treatment of list indexers compared to other indexers within the `_get_with` function. The key is indexed differently based on its type, leading to an incorrect behavior for list indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we should address the issue with list indexers to align with the expected behavior when indexing a Series.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key) if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat as positional indexer (iloc) or label-based (loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers in the `_get_with` function, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior when indexing a Series.
