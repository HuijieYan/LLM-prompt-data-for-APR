## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is responsible for handling different types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, and other non-list-like objects.
2. The bug occurs when a key that is a non-array-like object is passed to the function, and the function tries to handle it as a list in the subsequent logic.
3. The bug causes an incorrect handling of non-array-like keys leading to potential KeyError exceptions when trying to access elements not present in the index.
4. The bug is related to an inconsistency in how different types of keys are handled, as reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that non-list-like keys are correctly handled and passed to the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`). We should differentiate between array-like keys (like lists, arrays) and non-array-like keys (like scalars) and apply the appropriate logic for each case.

## Bug-Free Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this fixed version, the function properly handles the different types of keys, ensuring that non-array-like keys are processed correctly without leading to KeyError exceptions. This corrected version should resolve the bug reported in GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
