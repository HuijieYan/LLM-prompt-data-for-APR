### Analyzing the Buggy Function and Test Cases
- The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library, used for indexing a Series object with various types of keys.
- The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of indexing a Series with a key that does not match any values in the Series.
- The main issue seems to arise when a list-like key is used, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other types of keys.
- The expected behavior is for the key to be handled consistently regardless of whether it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of list-like keys in the provided conditionals.
2. Inconsistencies in handling different types of keys leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

### Cause of the Bug
- The bug seems to be related to the way list-like keys are handled in the `_get_with` function.
- When a list key is encountered, it tries to coerce it to a list, leading to unexpected behavior and causing a KeyError if the values in the list are not present in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the handling of list-like keys to ensure consistent behavior with other types of keys.
- Avoid coercing the key to a list if it is already an Index or other valid key type.
- Ensure that the key is correctly processed and the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) is used based on the key type.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Changes
- Removed unnecessary coercion of the key to a list in certain cases.
- Added `ensure_index` to ensure the key is in the expected format.
- Updated key handling to differentiate cases based on valid key types.
- Modified the logic to choose between `loc` and `iloc` indexing based on the key type.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle different types of keys consistently and resolve the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test case.
