## Analysis
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is a method of the `Series` class in pandas, responsible for indexing operations within a series.
2. The bug seems to be related to how different types of indexers are handled, specifically when using a list indexer.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be that the function does not handle list indexers properly, leading to a `KeyError` when trying to index with a list.
4. One strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, such as arrays or indices.

## Bug Fix
Given the analysis provided, here's a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if not is_list_like(key):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = np.asarray(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version checks if the key is list-like at the beginning, and if so, converts it to a numpy array before inferring its dtype and performing the indexing operation accordingly. This change ensures consistent handling of different types of indexers.
