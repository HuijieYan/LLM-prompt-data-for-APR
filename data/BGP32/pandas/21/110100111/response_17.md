The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is not handling the case where the key is a list properly, resulting in an inconsistency when trying to access elements using a list indexer. The issue reported on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior with the list case.

The bug occurs because the `_get_with` function is not correctly handling the list key case. It mistakenly assumes that `key` may not be a list-like object and tries to convert it into a list, causing an indexing error later in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the list key case correctly. We can update the function to directly handle list, numpy array, and Index objects without converting them into a list. Additionally, we need to ensure that lists are correctly indexed to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            key = np.asarray(key)
        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version directly handles list, numpy array, and Index objects without unnecessary conversion into a list. It ensures that list objects are correctly indexed to avoid the KeyError reported in the failing test case.

After applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should work correctly with different types of indexers and avoid the inconsistency reported on GitHub. This will resolve the bug and make the function behave consistently across different indexers.
