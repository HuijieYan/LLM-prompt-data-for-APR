To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to adjust the handling of key types to ensure consistency across different types of indexers. The issue arises from the function treating a list-like indexer differently from other array-like indexers, leading to a KeyError in certain cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this fix, we handle the list-like indexers the same way as other array-like indexers. This consistency ensures that the behavior is uniform across different types of indexers and prevents the KeyError from occurring with list indexers.

By applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
