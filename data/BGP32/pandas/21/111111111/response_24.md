To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object correctly. Currently, the function fails to handle this case properly, leading to a KeyError during the test execution.

The issue lies in the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` where it tries to access `self.loc[key]`. This causes a KeyError when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray.

We need to update the condition to explicitly handle the case when the key is a list-like object. The correct approach is to use `self.loc[key]` for label-based indexing and `self.iloc[key]` for positional indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles list-like objects as keys for indexing, preventing the KeyError that was occurring during the execution of the failing test cases.

Ensure to apply the updated `_get_with` function in the relevant file `pandas/core/series.py` to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
