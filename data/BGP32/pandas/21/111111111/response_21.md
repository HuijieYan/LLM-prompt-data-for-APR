Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue lies in the handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. The function fails to handle the case where the key is a list indexer correctly, leading to an incorrect behavior that triggers a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle list-like indexers. Specifically, we need to ensure that when the key is a list indexer, it is properly converted to a positional indexer before proceeding with the indexing operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to Index type for consistency
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is a list-like indexer. If it is, we convert the key to an Index type using the `ensure_index` function to ensure consistency. This modification will handle list-like indexers correctly and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

By applying this fix, the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle list-like indexers and pass the failing test cases provided.

Please incorporate this corrected version into the `pandas/core/series.py` file to address the bug.
