Based on the analysis provided, the issue in the buggy function `_get_with` arises due to the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers such as list-like objects. The bug occurs when trying to index a Series with a list-like object resulting in a KeyError.

To address this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. Specifically, we should handle list-like objects in a similar way as other array-like indexers to prevent the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    try:
        return self.loc[key]
    except KeyError:
        if is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[list(key)]
        raise
```

In this corrected version, we handle list-like objects by converting them to lists before attempting the indexing operation. This change ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers and prevents the KeyError that was observed in the failing test cases.

By implementing this fix, we address the bug in the `_get_with` function and ensure that the Series indexing behaves consistently with list-like objects.
