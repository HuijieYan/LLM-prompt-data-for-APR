To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list. Currently, the function treats this case differently from other array-like key types, causing the test to fail. The issue stems from the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the function.

Here is a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case when the key is a list.
2. Ensure that the function processes list-like keys in the same way as other array-like keys to maintain consistency in behavior.
3. Update the logic to handle list-like keys appropriately by adjusting the indexing method used in this case.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By applying this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like keys consistently with other array-like keys, resolving the issue identified in the failing test. This fix aligns the behavior of how different types of keys are processed and maintains consistency across various indexer types in the function.
