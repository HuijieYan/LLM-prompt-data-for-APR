To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class within the `pandas/core/series.py` file. The issue arises when indexing a Series with a list key, where the behavior is inconsistent compared to indexing with other types like ndarray or Index.

In the provided function, the conditional check for list-like keys is incorrect, leading to the error when indexing with a list. Here's a fixed version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, dict):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ["integer", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case
    return self.loc[key]
```

In this corrected version:
- We first check if the key is a slice, DataFrame, or tuple for specific handling.
- Next, we handle cases where the key is not list-like or a dict by using `self.loc[key]`.
- We ensure that list-like keys are properly processed for indexing.
- We infer the dtype of the key and handle integer or mixed-integer types accordingly.
- The function now returns the correct result when indexing with different types of keys.

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function should now handle list keys correctly and pass the failing test cases. Additionally, this modification aligns the behavior of indexing across various types consistently following the `loc` method's behavior.

This fix addresses the inconsistent behavior when indexing a Series with list keys and ensures that the expected output matches the provided test cases and the GitHub issue description.
