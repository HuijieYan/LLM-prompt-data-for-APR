To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to handle the case where the key is a list-like object. The issue arises when trying to access elements using a list-like key, causing a KeyError due to differences in handling this type of key compared to other types.

Based on the failing test case and the provided information, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys correctly. The key issue is in the section where an `Index` or a list-like key is provided. To resolve the bug, we need to make sure that the key is converted to a list before processing it.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if (
            is_list_like(key)
            and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))
        ):
            key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version now ensures that the key is converted to a list before making any further decisions on how to access elements from the Series object. This fix should allow the function to handle list-like keys correctly, resolving the KeyError issue encountered in the failing test cases.

After implementing this correction, the `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and align with the expected input/output values based on the provided information.
