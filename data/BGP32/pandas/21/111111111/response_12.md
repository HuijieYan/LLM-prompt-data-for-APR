## Fixing the Bug

### Bug Location
The bug is located in the `_get_with` function within the `Series` class. The issue arises when using an index that is a list within the `ser[key]` syntax. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised, even though other types of indexes, such as `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`, work correctly.

### Root Cause
The root cause of the bug is that when a list is used as an index, the current implementation raises a `KeyError` instead of correctly handling the operation. This inconsistency in behavior between list indexes and other types of indexes causes the failing test cases.

### Proposed Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles list-like indexes in the same way as other valid index types. This can be achieved by updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexes appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of the Fix
In the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the logic for handling list-like indexes has been updated. Now, when a list index is encountered, we treat it the same way as other valid index types such as `np.ndarray`, `Index`, and `Series`. This ensures consistent behavior and resolves the `KeyError` issue identified in the failing tests.

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly handles all types of indexes, including list-like indexes, and the tests should pass as expected.
