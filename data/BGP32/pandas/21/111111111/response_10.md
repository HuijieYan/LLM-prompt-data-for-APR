To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that when a list-like key is passed, it is treated consistently with other types of indexers such as arrays or Index objects. The issue lies in how list keys are handled differently from other index types.

By checking the inferred type of the key and adjusting the logic accordingly, we can make sure that all types of indexers behave consistently. We can modify the code in the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle list-like keys consistently
    if key_type in ["integer", "string", "mixed-integer"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this modification, we check the inferred type of the key and handle list-like keys in a manner consistent with other types of indexers. This change should ensure that the function behaves correctly for all types of keys, addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the GitHub issue.

Make sure to test the corrected function with the failing tests provided to verify that the bug has been fixed.
