To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers like list, array-like, Index, and Series. The bug is causing an inconsistency when using a list indexer, leading to a `KeyError` that is not raised for other indexers.

The issue stems from the conditional check `elif not is_list_like(key):` followed by `return self.loc[key]`. This check incorrectly assumes that `key` is not list-like when it actually is a list in some cases, causing the `KeyError` to occur.

To fix this bug, we can remove the condition `elif not is_list_like(key):` and directly handle the case when `key` is a list. We can modify the last part of the function to handle Index, Series, and list indexers in the same way, similar to how other indexers are handled. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list, Index, Series indexers in the same way
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By handling all types of indexers consistently and correctly, the corrected `_get_with` function should now pass the failing test cases and behave as expected, resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
