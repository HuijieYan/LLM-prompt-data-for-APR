Based on the analysis of the provided information, it appears that the bug lies in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the pandas library. The function is not handling list indexers correctly, which leads to a KeyError when trying to access elements using a list as the indexer.

The key issue is that for list indexers, the function is not converting the key to the appropriate format before accessing the Series data, causing the KeyError to be raised. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key is correctly handled for all types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Convert key to the appropriate format
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a step to convert the key to the appropriate format when it is a list indexer. This conversion ensures that the key is handled correctly, preventing the KeyError from occurring.

By making this adjustment, the `_get_with` function should now properly handle list indexers, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub report and allowing the failing tests to pass successfully.
