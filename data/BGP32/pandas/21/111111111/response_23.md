Based on the information provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how different types of indexers are handled when indexing a Series object. In the failing tests, the bug occurs when using a list as an indexer, resulting in a KeyError that is not raised for other types like ndarray.

The issue seems to be with how the function is handling list indexers compared to other types. To fix this bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers to prevent the KeyError from occurring when using a list indexer. 

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that should address the inconsistency:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should now handle list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, preventing the KeyError from occurring in the failing tests. It retains the behavior for other types of indexers such as ndarray, ensuring that the function works as expected across different indexers.
