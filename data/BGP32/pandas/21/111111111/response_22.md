To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure that all types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) behave consistently when used to access elements from a Series. Specifically, the function should treat all these types of indexers in the same way as the list case, where missing values return `NaN`.

The issue arises due to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, causing the function to raise a `KeyError` for list-like indexers like `pd.Series(key)`.

To resolve this bug, we should modify the `_get_with` function to handle all types of indexers consistently. We can achieve this by treating all indexers as list-like indexers to ensure that missing values default to `NaN` rather than raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Treat all types of indexers as list-like
    key = list(key)

    return self.loc[key]
```

By making this adjustment, the `_get_with` function will now handle all indexers consistently, ensuring that missing values are returned as `NaN`, resolving the bug reported in the failing test.
