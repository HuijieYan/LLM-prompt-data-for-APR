To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to adjust the handling of different types of indexers. Specifically, the issue arises when a list indexer is passed to the function, causing a KeyError. We should align the behavior of all indexers to match the handling of list indexers to ensure consistency.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle all types of indexers consistently
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index, pd.Index, Series)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        # handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
```

This updated version ensures that all indexers, including list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index, pd.Index, and Series, are processed consistently, avoiding the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.

By making this adjustment, the `_get_with` function will handle different types of indexers uniformly, aligning with the expected behavior of list indexers. This modification resolves the inconsistency and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
