To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to ensure consistency in the handling of different types of indexers. Currently, the function fails to handle list-like indexers correctly, leading to a `KeyError`. The bug stems from a discrepancy in how list indexers are processed compared to other types of indexers.

The issue is related to the different behaviors of the `_get_with` function based on the type of the key indexer. When the key is a list, the function fails to handle it properly, leading to the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like indexers consistently with other types of indexers. We can achieve this by ensuring that when the key is a list, it is correctly processed to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # Convert slice indexer to determine if it is positional or label based
        # and if label-based, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle list-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # Decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer or label-based
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers, addressing the KeyError issue and resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

This correction should now enable the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers appropriately and pass the failing test cases provided.
