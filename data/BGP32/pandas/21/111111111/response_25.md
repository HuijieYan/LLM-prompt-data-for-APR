## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block of the `_get_with` function. The function incorrectly tries to handle non-list-like indexers that are not recognized as scalars by trying to access `self.loc[key]`. This causes a `KeyError` to be raised when the key is a list which contains a non-existing value in the index.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the key is not list-like but not recognized as a scalar differently. We should return `self.loc[key]` only if `key` is a scalar that is not included in the index. For other non-list-like cases, we should treat them as list indexers and access the data accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling non-list-like key
    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding the condition to handle non-list-like but non-scalar keys correctly, we ensure that the function behaves as expected and avoids raising a `KeyError` when indexing with a list containing a non-existing value in the index. This correction addresses the issue reported in the GitHub thread as well.
