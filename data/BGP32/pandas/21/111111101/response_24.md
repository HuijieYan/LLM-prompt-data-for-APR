The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key types when checking for integers. The function does not properly handle the scenario where the key is a list-like object, leading to the KeyError when attempting to access the key directly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is not a scalar, it is handled correctly by identifying it as a list-like object and using `self.loc` to access the values.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # handle the case where key is list-like
        return self.loc[key]
    
    else:
        return self.reindex([key])
```

This corrected version should properly handle the scenario where the key is a list-like object and prevent the KeyError from occurring. It aligns with the expected input/output values and should pass the failing tests.
