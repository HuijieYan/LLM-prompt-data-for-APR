Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the handling of the key_type variable. The code seems to incorrectly infer the type of the key as 'string' in all cases, causing the KeyError to be raised instead of handling the key properly (which is a list in this case).

To fix this bug, we need to correctly infer the type of the key based on its content. If the key is a list, ndarray, or Index, it should be handled as such. We can update the code to use Python's isinstance function more effectively and handle the different types of keys appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == 'string' or key_type == 'unicode':
        key_type = 'object'
    
    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we update the key type checks based on the different data types that the key could be. We handle the case of list-like inputs and adjust the behavior for different inferred key types. By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now satisfy the expected input/output values for all test cases.
