### Fixing the bug in the _get_with function

The bug in the _get_with function arises when the key parameter is not recognized correctly, leading to an incorrect handling of the key indexing. The key is expected to be of type list, ndarray, Index, Series, or ExtensionArray. However, the current implementation checks for specific types and branches off differently based on those checks. This leads to unexpected behavior when trying to index with certain types, as seen in the failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key parameter is handled correctly for all valid types. We should remove the individual type checks and instead incorporate a more generic approach that covers all valid cases.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")
```

With this correction, the _get_with function should now correctly handle different key types and pass the failing test cases provided.
