Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the failing tests, as well as the expected input/output values, the bug in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of key types and the evaluation of whether a key should be treated as a positional indexer or label-based indexer.

The bug is triggered when the key type is recognized as a 'string', leading to incorrect processing in the subsequent steps. The expected behavior for the input key `'C'` is that it should be treated as a label-based index. Therefore, the bug fix should focus on correctly identifying the key type as a label-based index and ensuring that the appropriate indexing method (`self.loc[key]`) is used accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle label-based index
    if not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle other cases
    if not (is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index))):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle Index
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type

    if key_type == 'string':
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the key types and perform the indexing operations as expected based on the input key values.

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should pass the failing test cases provided and satisfy the expected input/output values for each case.
