The issue in the `_get_with` function seems to be related to the handling of the `key` parameter when it is a list-like object. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` instead of `'object'`, leading to incorrect behavior and test failures.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the input `key`. In the given cases, the input `key` is a list-like object, so we need to account for this properly in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This correction should ensure that the `key_type` is properly inferred from a list-like object, and the function should now handle the cases correctly based on the input `key`.

Please test this corrected version with the failing test cases to ensure that it now passes successfully.
