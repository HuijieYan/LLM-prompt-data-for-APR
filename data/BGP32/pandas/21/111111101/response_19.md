Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function is related to the handling of the key type. The function is not correctly identifying the key type, leading to incorrect behavior and causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the key type is properly identified and handled in the function. Specifically, we need to address the cases where the key is a list or ndarray, as these are not being properly handled in the current implementation.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handling list-like keys
    if is_list_like(key):
        if isinstance(key, (pd.Index, pd.Series, ExtensionArray)):
            return self.reindex(key)
        else:
            key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
       
    if key_type in ['integer', 'mixed-integer']:          
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version includes proper handling for list-like keys, distinguishing between different types of keys, and addressing the issue leading to the failing test cases. It should now pass the failing tests and provide the expected behavior for different types of keys.
