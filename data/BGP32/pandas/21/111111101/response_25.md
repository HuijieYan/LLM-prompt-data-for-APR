### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class does not handle the case where the `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series properly. It incorrectly assumes that the `key` is not list-like and tries to access it using `loc` which leads to a `KeyError` due to mismatched indexes.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the `key` is list-like correctly. We should check if the `key` is an instance of a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series, and then handle it appropriately based on its type.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected code, we specifically handle the case when the `key` is a list, numpy array, pandas Index, or pandas Series and access the values using `loc` correctly. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
