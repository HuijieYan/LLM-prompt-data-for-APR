### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the key parameter when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. The function checks if the key is not list-like, and if so, it tries to use `self.loc[key]`. However, when the key is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series, it incorrectly converts the key into a list and then tries to infer the key type based on the elements of the key. This leads to incorrect behavior and raises a KeyError in the failing test cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key is correctly handled when it is a list, ndarray, Index, or Series. Instead of converting the key into a list and inferring the key type, we can directly use `self.loc[key]` for Index and Series types. For list and ndarray types, we will handle them separately to avoid the KeyError.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handling list and ndarray cases
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By directly using `self.loc[key]` for list and ndarray types, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle the key parameter and pass the failing tests.
