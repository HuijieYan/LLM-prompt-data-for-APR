Based on the analysis provided, the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the logic for handling the 'key' parameter. The function does not properly handle the case when 'key' is a list-like object, resulting in incorrect behavior and causing the failing tests.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic for handling different types of 'key' inputs, ensuring that list-like objects are correctly processed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key inputs
    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check if key is a scalar that is not recognized by lib.is_scalar
    if not lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    raise ValueError("Unhandled key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

This corrected version includes a check for list-like keys and ensures that they are properly handled using `self.loc[key]`. Additionally, it includes a catch-all clause to raise an error for unhandled key types.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests and correctly handle different types of 'key' inputs.
