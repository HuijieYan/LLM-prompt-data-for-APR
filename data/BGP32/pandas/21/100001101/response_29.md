## Buggy Function Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, it has a bug related to incorrectly identifying the `key_type`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The way the function determines the `key_type` might be incorrect, leading to wrong branches being taken based on the type of key.
2. The function might not be handling the different types of keys appropriately, leading to unexpected behaviors.

### Cause of the Bug
Based on the runtime and expected values provided, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect determination of the `key_type`. In all cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which might be causing the function to take the wrong paths when accessing or slicing the Series.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined based on the type of key provided. This will involve revisiting how the function identifies the type of key and making necessary adjustments to handle different key types correctly.

### Corrected Function
Based on the analysis, here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    if isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)

    raise TypeError("Unsupported key type for indexing Series")
```

This correction involves updating the way key types are checked and handled within the function, ensuring that the correct branching logic is followed for each key type provided.
