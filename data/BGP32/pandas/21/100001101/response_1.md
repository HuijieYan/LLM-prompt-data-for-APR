## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` to extract values from a Series object. However, there are issues with the condition checking and type handling in the function that lead to incorrect outcomes.

1. The function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'` for cases where the key should be treated as positional (like integers).
2. The function attempts to convert the key to a list even when it is not suitable for list operations.
3. There is redundant code for handling a list input since the previous conditions should have already captured all list-like inputs.

## Fix Strategy
1. Improve the logic for determining the `key_type` based on the actual type of the `key` input. This will help accurately decide whether the key should be treated as a label or a position.
2. Refactor the key handling logic to avoid unnecessary conversions and redundant checks.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_object_dtype(key) or is_extension_array_dtype(key):
        key = ensure_index(key)

    if lib.infer_dtype(key) == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With these corrections, the function should now properly handle different types of `key` inputs, determine the appropriate action based on their type, and eliminate redundant operations.
