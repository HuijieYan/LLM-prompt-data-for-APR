### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing within a Series object. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object that contains a single element of type string. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` in such cases, leading to incorrect indexing operations.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 4, the input key is a list, ndarray, or Series object containing a single string element respectively.
2. The function incorrectly infers the `key_type` as `'string'` due to the presence of a single string element in the key.
3. This incorrect inference results in the function attempting to index the Series object `self` using label-based indexing (`self.loc[key]`), instead of positional indexing (`self.iloc[key]`).
4. This behavior deviates from the expected flow and causes incorrect slicing/indexing of the Series object.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to update the logic that determines the `key_type` based on the input key to correctly identify string-like elements within a list-like object. Additionally, we should ensure that the correct indexing method (label-based or positional) is used based on the key's type.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            key_type = "boolean"
        else:
            key_type = ""
            for val in key:
                if is_integer(val):
                    key_type = "integer"
                elif is_object_dtype(val):
                    key_type = "object"

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes modifications to correctly infer the `key_type` based on the elements within the input key. By ensuring the accurate identification of key types, the function will perform the correct indexing operation on the Series object.
