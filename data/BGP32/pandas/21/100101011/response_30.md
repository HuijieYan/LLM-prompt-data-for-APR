### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers when getting values from a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior when trying to access values in a Series with an index that does not match any existing values.
3. The bug seems to stem from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, specifically when using a list indexer.
4. The key issue highlighted in the GitHub report is that the behavior for list indexers differs from array-like indexers, leading to unexpected KeyError in certain cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the handling of list indexers differently from other array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when using a list indexer in the failing test. The function fails to properly handle the type check and processing of list indexers compared to other types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of list indexers along with other array-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to address the issue where list indexers result in a KeyError when the index does not match any existing values.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
        
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        if all(elem in self.index for elem in key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the {self.index}")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now includes a specific check for list indexers to ensure they behave consistently with other array-like indexers. By verifying if all elements in the list indexer exist in the Series index before returning the values, the corrected function resolves the KeyError issue identified in the failing test and the GitHub report.
