### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` focuses on testing how the function behaves when trying to access values that do not exist in the Series.
3. The bug occurs when the input key is a list, and the function tries to access elements based on that list, leading to a KeyError.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when indexing with a list compared to other array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in handling list indexers in the `_get_with` function. When the key is a list, the function tries to access the elements directly which results in a KeyError if the elements are not present in the Series index. This behavior is different from how the function handles other array-like indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers. Specifically, when the key is a list, we should handle it similar to other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key = key.values

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the corrections as shown above, the function should now handle list indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, resolving the KeyError issue.
