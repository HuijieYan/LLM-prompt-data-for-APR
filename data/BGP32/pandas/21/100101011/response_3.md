### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when the `key` parameter is passed as an array-like index (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to the `ser[key]` operation in the `test_getitem_no_matches` test function. When the `key` is a list or ndarray, the code correctly handles the indexing. Still, when `key` is an Index or Series object, it incorrectly expects the `key` values to be present in the index of the Series object, leading to a KeyError.

The buggy function `_get_with` in the `series.py` file fails to handle the case where the `key` is of type Index or Series properly. It mistakenly tries to match the `key` values with the index values of the Series, resulting in the KeyError when the values do not match exactly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to correctly handle the case when `key` is of type Index or Series. Instead of directly trying to use the `key` values for indexing, we should handle them differently to avoid the KeyError. We can modify the logic to check the type of `key` and handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        # handle scalars or non-Index/Series cases
        return self.loc[key]

    key_values = key if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)) else list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_values, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key_values]
    else:
        return self.iloc[key_values]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we properly handle the cases when `key` is an Index or Series by extracting the values from the Index/Series objects. Then, we use these values for indexing the Series object without directly comparing them to the index values, which resolves the KeyError issue.
