### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexers in a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of the Series when trying to access an element that does not exist in the index using different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`).
3. The runtime values and types of variables show that in all cases, the `key_type` is inferred as `'string'`, which is incorrect for the input data.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency of behavior when using different types of indexers, particularly the discrepancy with the `list` indexer.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the incorrect inference of `key_type` as `'string'` for all cases, leading to improper handling of the indexer types. This incorrect inference causes the function to return unexpected results and trigger errors when accessing elements not in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of indexer being used. Specifically, for the cases where the key is a list or ndarray, the inferred type should not default to `'string'`. We should handle these cases appropriately to align with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    elif isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = 'array-like'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the logic to correctly infer the type of the key based on different indexer types like a list or ndarray, we can ensure that the function handles the cases appropriately and resolves the bug, passing the failing tests.
