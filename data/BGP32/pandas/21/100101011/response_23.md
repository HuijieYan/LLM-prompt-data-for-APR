### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing keys for a Series object in pandas. The issue arises when a list-like key is passed, resulting in an inconsistency compared to other indexers like arrays or Index objects, which leads to a KeyError in certain cases.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in how the function handles list-like keys, specifically in the case where `key` is a list. This behavior is causing inconsistency compared to other indexers like arrays or Index objects. The key_type is incorrectly identified as `'integer'`, leading to the function choosing the wrong path for indexing the Series.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like keys to align with the behavior shown for arrays or Index objects. By correctly determining the key_type and following the appropriate path for indexing, we can ensure consistency and prevent the KeyError from occurring.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments to properly handle list-like keys in the `_get_with` function, the bug should be fixed, and the function should now behave consistently for different indexers. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
