### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object in pandas. The bug seems to be related to the handling of list-like key inputs, leading to a KeyError when trying to index using a list key.

### Identified Issue:
The bug arises when dealing with a list key input, where the function incorrectly raises a KeyError instead of properly handling the indexing. This behavior is inconsistent with how other types of array-like indexers are handled in pandas.

### Bug Cause:
The key cause of the bug can be attributed to the conditional checks within the `_get_with` function. When a list input key is detected, the function should handle it correctly by not raising a KeyError but rather processing the list-like key as intended.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the handling of list-like keys needs to be adjusted in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, when a list key is detected, it should be processed correctly without raising a KeyError, aligning with the expected behavior for other array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # Corrected this line to handle list keys correctly

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By modifying the conditional block handling list keys to properly return the sliced Series, the corrected function should now behave consistently with other array-like indexers in pandas. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the KeyError issue.
