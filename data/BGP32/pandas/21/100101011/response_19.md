**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function `_get_with` in `pandas/core/series.py` is responsible for handling different types of indexing operations on a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` specifically tests the behavior when the key does not match any index values in the Series.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in how list indexers are treated differently from other array-like indexers when attempting to access non-existing keys. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and raises a `KeyError`.

**Error Location:**
The bug likely occurs in the block of code handling the case when the key is not list-like (`elif not is_list_like(key)`). In this case, scalar values that are not recognized properly cause the bug.

**Cause of the Bug:**
1. In the failing test, the provided `key` values of `['C']`, `array(['C'], dtype=object)`, and `Index(['C'], dtype='object')` are all representations of the same key 'C' in different types (list, ndarray, and Index).
2. The function incorrectly assumes that the key type is a scalar value (`key_type = 'string'`) based on the non-list-like check, leading to incorrect handling of the key.
3. This incorrect inference of the key type results in the function attempting to perform operations that are not suitable for the actual key type, leading to a `KeyError`.

**Bug Fix Strategy:**
1. Update the logic for determining the key type more accurately, considering different types of keys and handling them appropriately.
2. Ensure that the function treats non-list-like keys correctly to prevent the `KeyError` and maintain consistent behavior across different types of indexers.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By correcting the logic for handling non-list-like keys and ensuring proper determination of the key type, the corrected version of the function should now appropriately handle different types of indexers, resolving the `KeyError` issue in the failing test case.
