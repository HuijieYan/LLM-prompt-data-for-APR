### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series in pandas. The issue in the function arises when a key that is a list-like object is passed as an input. The function incorrectly assumes that the key should go through the `loc` indexer, leading to a KeyError if the key is not found in the Series index.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to demonstrate this issue by passing different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) to the Series object and expecting KeyError when there is no match found in the Series index.

### Error Location
The key area causing the bug can be identified within the block that checks for `is_list_like(key)` and tries to handle scalars. In this block, the function wrongly tries to retrieve the key using `self.loc[key]`, leading to the KeyError when the key is not present in the Series index.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the function tries to directly access the key using the `loc` indexer for list-like objects without checking if the key exists in the Series index first. This leads to the KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

### Approach to Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior when dealing with list-like objects as keys. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should first check if the key elements exist in the Series index. If not found, we should handle this scenario gracefully without raising a KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else pd.NA  # Check if key exists in index before accessing

    key_list = list(key) if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)) else key

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_list, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key] if all(k in self.index for k in key) else pd.NA  # Check if all key elements exist in index

    return self.reindex(key_list) if all(k in self.index for k in key_list) else pd.Series([], index=key_list)  # Reindex only if all elements exist

```

This corrected version includes checks to ensure that the key elements exist in the Series index before attempting to access or reindex them. It avoids the KeyError situation when the key is not present in the index.
