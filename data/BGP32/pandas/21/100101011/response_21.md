### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is trying to index a Series using an array-like key that should result in a `KeyError` when no matches are found in the index.
3. The bug causes an incorrect handling of array-like keys, leading to inconsistency in error handling.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency between indexing a Series with list indexers and array-like indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function. When an array-like indexer does not match any values in the Series index, the function should raise a `KeyError`. However, due to incorrect logic, the function does not raise the error as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an array-like key does not match any values in the Series index, a `KeyError` is raised consistently across different types of array-like indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_array(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making changes to the `_get_with` function to correctly handle array-like indexers, the bug should be resolved, and the function should now raise a `KeyError` when no matches are found in the Series index for array-like keys.
