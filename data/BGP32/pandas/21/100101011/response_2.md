### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index).
2. Determining the `key_type` based on the input key.
3. Reindexing based on the key.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug lies in how the function `_get_with` handles different types of indexers, specifically when dealing with 'list' type indexers. In the failing test, when passing a list indexer, the function incorrectly raises a KeyError, stating that none of the elements are in the index. This behavior is inconsistent compared to how other types of indexers are handled, leading to test failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
2. Properly handle the 'list' type indexer to align with other indexers.
3. Refactor the logic to determine the `key_type` and optimize the reindexing process.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure index-like behavior for all types

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Reindex based on the key
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By ensuring that the key is treated consistently as an index-like object and adjusting the index handling logic, the corrected function should now handle list indexers correctly and align with the expected behavior of other indexers. This solution addresses the issue reported on GitHub and ensures a more robust and predictable behavior for different types of indexers.
