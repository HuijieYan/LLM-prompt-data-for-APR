### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys when indexing a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` tries to index a Series with an array-like key that does not exist in the Series index and expects a KeyError to be raised.
3. The bug stems from the handling of list-like keys inside the function `_get_with`, especially when converting them to a list before indexing. This causes an inconsistency with other array-like indexers like np.ndarray or Index.
4. The bug is due to treating list keys differently than other array-like keys, leading to incorrect behavior and KeyError in specific cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of list-like keys in the `_get_with` function. When processing a list key, it is converted to a list again, causing failures in the indexing process and raising KeyError incorrectly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the handling of list keys so that they are treated consistently with other array-like indexers. By avoiding unnecessary conversions and ensuring proper handling of list keys, we can resolve the issue and make the behavior consistent across different types of keys.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # avoid unnecessary conversion for list keys
    if isinstance(key, list) and not isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes to correctly handle list keys within the `_get_with` function, we ensure that the behavior is consistent across different types of array-like indexers and resolve the issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
