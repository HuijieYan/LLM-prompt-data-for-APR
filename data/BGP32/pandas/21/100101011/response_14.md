### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers for a Series object.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior when an index with no matching values is used to access the Series data.
3. The bug occurs when a list-like indexer is passed to the Series object, triggering a KeyError that is inconsistent with the behavior of other types of indexers.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the discrepancy in behavior between different types of indexers (list, ndarray, Index, Series) and suggests aligning them to have consistent behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when a list-like indexer is used. The function incorrectly raises a KeyError when trying to access values that do not exist in the Series, which is inconsistent with the behavior of other indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` should handle list-like indexers in a similar way to other types of indexers (ndarray, Index, Series). This involves ensuring that accessing values using a list-like indexer does not raise a KeyError when values are not found.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the handling of list-like indexers to be consistent with other types of indexers, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue regarding inconsistent behavior.
