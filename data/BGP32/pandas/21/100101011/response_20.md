### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to retrieve values from a Series object based on the input `key`. It handles different types of input keys like slices, DataFrames, tuples, lists, etc.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` checks the behavior when a key that has no matches in the Series index is used for indexing.
3. The bug comes from the handling of keys that have no matches in the Series index. The function should raise a KeyError when the key is not found in the index, but the current implementation is not handling it correctly, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.
4. To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where the key is not found in the Series index and raise a KeyError with an appropriate message.
5. The correction involves modifying the logic to properly handle the case of a key that has no matches and provide a consistent behavior for all types of indexers.

### Bug Cause:
The bug stems from the part of the function handling the case when the key is not present in the Series index. It does not raise a KeyError with the correct message in that scenario, leading to incorrect behavior and failing tests.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Identify the location where the function should handle the case of the key not being found in the Series index.
2. Ensure that the function raises a KeyError with the appropriate message when the key is not found.
3. Implement a consistent behavior for all types of indexers to handle the case of no matches in the index.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if not any(np.in1d(key, self.index)):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including the check for whether any elements of the key are in the Series index and raising a KeyError with the appropriate message if not found, the corrected function will handle the case of no matches in the index correctly. This adjustment ensures a consistent behavior for all types of indexers.
