### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to test the behavior of indexing a Series with different types of inputs that do not match any values in the index.
3. Based on the failing test and the runtime values provided, the issue arises when the input `key` is in the form of a list, ndarray, Index, or Series containing a value that is not in the Series itself. The error message is expecting all the list-like input types to behave consistently, but the buggy function does not handle this correctly.
4. The bug is likely related to the handling of list-like input types that do not match any values in the Series index. The current implementation leads to inconsistent behavior for different types of input containers.
5. To fix the bug, adjustments need to be made in how the function handles list-like input types that do not contain any values present in the Series index.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by inconsistent handling of list-like input types (`list`, `np.ndarray`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`) that do not contain any values present in the Series index. The function `_get_with` does not provide consistent behavior for these types of inputs, leading to unexpected KeyErrors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that list-like input types that do not contain any values present in the Series index are handled consistently.
2. Modify the function logic to check for non-existent values in the index of the Series when dealing with list-like input types.
3. Update the conditional checks and return statements to provide a unified behavior for list-like input types in such scenarios.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Check for non-existent values in the Series index
    if all(idx not in self.index for idx in key):
        raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the suggested fix in the corrected version of the `_get_with` function, consistent handling of list-like input types that do not contain any values present in the Series index is ensured. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and make the function behave uniformly across different list-like input containers.
