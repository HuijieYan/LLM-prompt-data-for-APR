### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is failing to handle the case where the key is a list. This is evident from the failing test `test_getitem_no_matches`, where an error is raised when trying to access a value with a key that is a list. The function is not treating list indexers the same way as array-like indexers, which leads to an inconsistency in behavior.

### Error Locations
The key error in the function `_get_with` lies in the handling of different types of keys: specifically, not properly handling list indexers.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when the key is a list, the function does not handle it correctly and triggers an error, as seen in the failing test. This inconsistency with how list indexers are treated compared to other types of indexers causes the issue.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to properly handle list indexers in the same manner as array-like indexers. By adjusting the logic to treat list indexers consistently with other types, we can resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function now properly handles list indexers and should pass the failing test, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
