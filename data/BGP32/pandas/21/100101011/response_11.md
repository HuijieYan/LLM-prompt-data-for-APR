### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of indexing methods for a Series object in pandas.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` aims to check the behavior when trying to access elements in a Series using different types of indexers.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles specific types of indexers, especially when using a list as an indexer.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially with lists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function encounters a list as an indexer. It results in a KeyError when trying to access non-existing elements from the Series, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent behavior for all types of indexers, including lists. We should handle the case of list indexers properly to avoid KeyError exceptions.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if all(is_bool(val) for val in key):
            key = np.asarray(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to properly handle list indexers and convert them to NumPy arrays if they contain boolean values, the bug causing the KeyError should be fixed. This correction aligns the behavior across different types of indexers, ensuring consistency and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
