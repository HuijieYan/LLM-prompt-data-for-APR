### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of indexers like slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various other index-like objects.
2. The bug occurs when dealing with list-like indexers, where a KeyError is raised erroneously.
3. The issue arises from the inconsistent handling of list indexers compared to other types like arrays or Series.
4. The key_type determined for list indexers is 'string', which is incorrect and leads to incorrect reindexing behavior.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug stems from the function incorrectly inferring the key_type for list indexers as 'string' instead of 'integer'.
2. Due to this incorrect inference, the function fails to handle the list indexers properly and leads to a KeyError.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred for list indexers as 'integer' to maintain consistency with other index-like objects.
2. Modify the logic to handle list indexers appropriately based on their inferred key_type.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")

    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.iloc[key]  # Corrected to use iloc for list indexers
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Explanation of Fix:
1. I have corrected the handling of list indexers by using `iloc` instead of `loc` to access the elements based on their positional integer index.
2. By making this change, the function now handles list indexers consistently with other index-like objects, resolving the KeyError issue observed in the failing test cases.
