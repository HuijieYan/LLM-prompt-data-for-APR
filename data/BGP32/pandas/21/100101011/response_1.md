### Bug Analysis
1. The function `_get_with` in the file `pandas/core/series.py` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py` tests indexing a Series with a key that has no matches in the Series index.
3. The bug occurs when the key is converted to a list, and then the code attempts to index the Series with this list.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency in behavior when using different types of indexers, especially when the key has no matches in the Series index.

### Error Location
The bug in the `_get_with` function likely occurs in the block of code handling cases where the key is not list-like and needs to be converted to a list. Specifically, the issue arises when indexing the Series with a converted list key that has no matches in the Series index, leading to a KeyError.

### Bug Explanation
In the failing test, when a key `['C']` is passed as a list, the function tries to convert the key to a list regardless, even if it is already a list. This conversion process leads to a mismatch between the expected Index values and the values in the Series index, resulting in a KeyError when attempting to perform the indexing operation.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the key is already list-like correctly. We should avoid converting it to a list again and ensure that the key's elements are present in the Series index before performing the indexing operation.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, list):
        if not all(k in self.index for k in key):
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the key is already list-like before attempting to convert it to a list. If the key is a list, we verify that all its elements are present in the Series index before proceeding with the indexing operation. This approach ensures that no KeyError is raised when indexing with a key that has no matches in the Series index.
