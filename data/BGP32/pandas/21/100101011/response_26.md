### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is used for indexing operations on a Series object in pandas. It checks the type of the input `key` and handles different cases accordingly. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` demonstrates an issue when using a list as the key for indexing.

#### Error Locations:
1. The handling of a list-like key is incorrect and leads to a KeyError.
2. The determination of `key_type` based on the inferred type of the key is causing the incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers, especially when the key is list-like. When a list key is used, the function incorrectly tries to treat it as an Index object, leading to a KeyError due to mismatched indexes.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Update the handling of list-like keys to properly handle them without trying to convert them into an Index object.
2. Adjust the logic for determining `key_type` to correctly identify the type of the key.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adds a specific condition for handling list-like keys by directly using `self.loc[key]` if the `key` is not recognized as a known type. This adjustment ensures that list keys are treated correctly and should resolve the KeyError issue identified in the failing test case.
