### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input `key` when indexing a Series. However, in the current implementation, there is an inconsistency in how list-like indexers are handled compared to other types like array-like and Index. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when trying to index with a list-like input.

The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` specifically demonstrates this inconsistency by showcasing how indexing with a list throws a KeyError compared to other types that return NaN values.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for handling non-list-like key types might be incorrect.
2. The indexing behavior for different types of key might not be consistent.
3. The reindex method might not handle the list-like key properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. When a list-like key is used for indexing, the function defaults to the reindex method branch, which leads to a KeyError, as observed in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different types of indexers within the `_get_with` function. Specifically, we need to correctly identify list-like indexers and ensure they are handled appropriately to avoid the KeyError.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the inconsistency and ensures proper handling of list-like indexers:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        # Check if the key is list-like
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle the case where key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.reindex(key)

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By checking if the key is list-like and forwarding it to `self.loc[key]`, we ensure consistent behavior across different types of indexers. This correction should allow the function to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
