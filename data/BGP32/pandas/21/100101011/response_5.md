### Bug Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function fails when receiving a key that is a list-like object.
2. In the failing test, an assertion error is raised because the key, when passed as a list, is not found in the Series index.
3. The key_type variable wrongly identifies the type as 'string' for all input types, regardless of the actual types passed.
4. The bug stems from incorrectly handling the case where the key is list-like, resulting in inconsistency in indexing behavior.
5. The issue on GitHub highlights this inconsistency and suggests aligning the behavior with list-like indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys consistently by allowing access to the elements in the Series when they are passed as a list.
2. Revise the determination of key_type to accurately reflect the inferred type of the key passed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_list_like = is_list_like(key)
    if not key_list_like or isinstance(key, Index):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if key_list_like:
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to correctly handle list-like keys and determining the key type accurately, the corrected version should align with the expected behavior and address the issue reported on GitHub. This fix should help the failing test cases pass successfully.
