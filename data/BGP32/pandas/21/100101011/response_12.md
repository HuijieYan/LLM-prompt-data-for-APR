### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series.
2. The failing test `test_getitem_no_matches` is testing the behavior of indexing with a list, ndarray, Index, and Series that do not have matching values with the Series index.
3. At the end of the function, the return logic for handling different key types based on their inferred type might have issues causing the KeyError.
4. The GitHub issue mentions the inconsistent behavior when using a list indexer compared to array-like indexers and the need for alignment in handling these cases.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of key indexers when none of the values match the Series index. In particular, the logic for determining the key_type and deciding whether to use `self.loc` or `self.iloc` for indexing could lead to unexpected KeyErrors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to align the behavior for all types of key indexers when none of the values match the Series index. We should handle this case consistently across different key types by properly handling the key_type inference and selection of `loc` or `iloc` indexing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ("integer", "string", "floating", "mixed-integer-float"):
        return self.reindex(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version includes adjustments to handle all key indexers consistently when none of the values match the Series index. By inferring the key_type and selecting the appropriate indexing method based on this type, the function should now correctly handle the edge case highlighted by the failing test.
