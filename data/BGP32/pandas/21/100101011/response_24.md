### Analysis:
1. The `buggy _get_with` function is attempting to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series.
2. The issue arises when trying to index with a list-type key, leading to a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.
3. The failed test `test_getitem_no_matches` showcases this issue by expecting consistent behavior for different types of indexers (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, `pd.Series`).
4. The key_type is incorrectly identified as `'integer'` due to the misclassification arising from lists of single string values.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect identification of the key_type as `'integer'` when indexing with a list of single string values. This leads to a wrong path being taken in handling the indexing operation, ultimately resulting in a KeyError when the key is not found in the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Use the appropriate type checks to handle the different kinds of input keys consistently and accurately identify the key_type.
2. Update the handling logic for list-type keys to align with the expected behavior for all types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        # Update the key_type inference to handle single string values in list-like keys
        if isinstance(key, list) and all(isinstance(k, str) for k in key):
            key_type = 'object'
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes an updated key_type inference mechanism to correctly identify the type of key being used for indexing, specifically handling single string values within list-like keys. This adjustment should address the bug and ensure consistent behavior for different types of indexers when indexing a Series.
