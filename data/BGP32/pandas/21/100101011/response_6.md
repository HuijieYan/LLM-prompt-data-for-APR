### Analysis:
1. The function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists.
2. The bug occurs when the key is a list-like object in the provided function.
3. The key_type variable determines the type of key, but in the failing test cases, the key is a list, leading to an incorrect determination of the key type as 'integer'.
4. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle list-like keys, resulting in failed tests due to KeyErrors.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that list-like keys are correctly processed without inferring an incorrect key type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the code section handling list-like keys to correctly handle these keys without inferring 'integer' as the key type.
2. Treat list-like keys in a consistent manner similar to other array-like indexers.
3. Update the logic to handle list-like keys separately to address the bug effectively.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    in_list_like = is_list_like(key)
    if not in_list_like:
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type in ['integer', 'string']:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Summary:
The corrected function now properly handles list-like keys without inferring an incorrect key type, which was causing KeyErrors in the failing test cases. By updating the logic, the function can now handle different types of keys consistently, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
