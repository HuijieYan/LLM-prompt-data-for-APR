### Issue Analysis:
The bug arises from the function `_get_with` in the `Series` class. The function is designed to handle different types of input `key` and determine how to index the series based on the type. The bug causes an issue when a list type key is provided. The bug results in incorrect behavior when indexing a Series using a list key.

### Error Location:
The bug mainly manifests in the section where the key type is checked and handled. The key is not correctly handled when it is a list type.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug stems from the key not being correctly processed when it is of list type. The function incorrectly identifies the key type as 'integer' instead of handling it as a list for indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the key is of list type, it is appropriately processed for indexing the series.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional() or key_type == 'integer':
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        else:
            return self.loc[key]  # List-like key handled here
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, I have added a check to handle the list-like key correctly. It now correctly indexes the series when the key is of list type, resolving the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
