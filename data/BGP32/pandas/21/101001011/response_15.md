### Error Location
The bug seems to be located in the section of code where the type of the `key` parameter is being checked and processed. The issue arises when the `key` is a list with non-matching values which leads to an incorrect return value based on assumptions about the type of `key`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug stems from the assumption that if `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to access the `loc` attribute of `key`. However, when `key` contains non-matching values, this approach results in a KeyError because it is treated as an index lookup operation. This behavior is inconsistent compared to array-like indexers and can lead to unexpected errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should handle the case where `key` is a list-like object with non-matching values differently to prevent the KeyError. It is important to align the behavior of the function with how array-like indexers are treated to maintain consistency in handling different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key] if key in self.index else self.reindex([key])

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index.is_all_dates() and key_type == "string":
            return self.reindex(key)
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
    return self.loc[key]
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, the bug related to the inconsistent treatment of list-like indexers will be resolved, aligning the behavior with array-like indexers and preventing unexpected KeyErrors.
