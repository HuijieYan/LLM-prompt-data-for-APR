### Analyzing the buggy function and related information
From the provided buggy function `_get_with`, the function currently handles different types of input keys to select and return values from the Series object. The function goes through various checks to analyze the type of key provided and proceeds accordingly. The bug seems to be related to the handling of a specific type of key input, which results in an incorrect output.

According to the GitHub issue, there is inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated when used with a Series object. In particular, the issue highlights the difference in behavior when using list indexers as opposed to other types like array-like or Index. The inconsistent behavior results in unexpected errors, as seen in the example provided in the issue.

### Identifying the bug and its cause
By examining the provided test cases along with the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function arises when dealing with list-like keys. The function should handle list indexers in a consistent manner with other types of indexers, as discussed in the issue.

In the failing test cases, the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as `'string'`, which indicates that the key type is not being recognized correctly within the function. This misclassification of the key type leads to the incorrect branch selection within the function and ultimately results in incorrect output.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To address the bug in the `_get_with` function and make it consistent with the behavior highlighted in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that list-like keys are handled correctly. Specifically, list indexers should be treated in a consistent manner with other types of indexers to avoid errors and maintain coherence in the Series indexing mechanism.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis and the identified issue, here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key type is inferred correctly using `lib.infer_dtype`, ensuring that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This modification should resolve the issue related to inconsistent behavior when using list indexers with Series objects.
