### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, specifically when the indexer is a list. The function fails to handle list indexers correctly, leading to an incorrect behavior that causes failures in certain scenarios.

### Bug Location
The issue lies in the code block where it checks if the key is not a list-like object. If the key is not list-like, the code attempts to use `self.loc[key]` assuming `key` is a scalar. However, this approach is flawed when dealing with list indexers, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of list indexers to ensure consistency and proper indexing. We should handle list-like objects separately in a way that matches the desired behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if is_scalar(key) or is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Index):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list indexers are consistently handled and indexed correctly, resolving the issue observed with list-like objects in the original function.
