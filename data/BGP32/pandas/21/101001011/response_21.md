### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, the issue arises when dealing with a list-like key that does not match any indexes, leading to inconsistencies in behavior compared to other types of indexers.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of list-like keys that do not match any indexes.
2. Inconsistencies in behavior for different types of indexers.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the handling of list-like keys during indexing. When a list-like key is provided, and it does not match any indexes in the Series, the function fails to handle this case properly, leading to inconsistent behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function `_get_with` needs to be modified to handle list-like keys that do not match any indexes more effectively. Additionally, ensuring consistency in behavior across different types of indexers is crucial.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # handle the case when the key does not match any indexes
        if len(set(key).intersection(set(self.index))) == 0:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

### Updated Explanation:
The corrected version of the `_get_with` function now includes a check for list-like keys that do not match any indexes. If the provided key does not have any intersections with the existing indexes, a `KeyError` is raised to indicate that none of the specified keys are in the Series index. This modification aims to solve the inconsistency and handle the edge case more effectively.
