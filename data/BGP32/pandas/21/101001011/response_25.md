### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. However, based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, it can be seen that the function incorrectly identifies the key type as "string" regardless of the actual type passed.

The issue is related to inconsistent behavior when indexing with a list compared to other indexers like arrays or indices. The bug occurs when the key is a list, resulting in an incorrect handling of the index, leading to errors.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect inference of the `key_type` variable, assuming it is always "string" when indexing with a list. This causes the function to not correctly choose the proper indexing method based on the type of key provided.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly determine the type of the key being passed for indexing and choose the appropriate indexing method accordingly. This involves updating the logic for inferring the `key_type` based on the actual type of the key.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version now correctly handles the inference of the `key_type` based on the type of the key provided for indexing. This ensures that the function will choose the appropriate indexing method according to the type of key, resolving the bug related to indexing with lists in the `Series` class of the `pandas` library.
