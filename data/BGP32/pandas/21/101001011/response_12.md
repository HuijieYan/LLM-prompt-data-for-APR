The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of indexers. The function incorrectly processes the key_type as 'integer' when it should have been recognizing it as 'string' or another data type. This leads to improper indexing behavior for certain input types.

The issue arises when using list-like indexers that are not recognized correctly by the function, causing it to use incorrect logic paths that result in errors or incorrect retrievals. The function should handle these cases properly to ensure consistency across different types of indexers.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the key_type is inferred for different indexer types and update the logic accordingly to accurately process the input parameters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the key is converted to an index for consistent handling and infer the key_type based on the actual data type of the key. This approach ensures proper indexing behavior for different types of indexers and resolves the inconsistencies observed in the failing test cases.
