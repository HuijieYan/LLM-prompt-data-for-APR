### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling various types of key inputs and then returning the corresponding result.
2. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles different types of key inputs, especially when dealing with single values or lists.
3. The runtime input/output values indicate that for certain cases, the function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'` instead of `'object'`, which leads to incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the `key_type` based on the input key and handles single values and lists in a consistent manner.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrectly identifying the `key_type` for certain key inputs. This incorrect identification leads to an inconsistent behavior when handling single values or lists. The issue originates from the way the function infers the data type of the key and branches into different paths based on this information.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for all types of keys and then handle the different cases accordingly. Additionally, the function should maintain consistency when dealing with single values and lists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" or key_type == "string":  # Corrected if statement to include 'string'
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key_type is correctly inferred for all key inputs, including 'string' type keys. Additionally, the function now handles single values and lists consistently. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide a more stable behavior for the `_get_with` function.
