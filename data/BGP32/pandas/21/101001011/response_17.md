### Error Location
The issue lies within the conditional statements handling different types of input `key` in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the problem arises when `key` is a list, which leads to incorrect behavior due to mismatched comparisons.

### Bug Cause
1. In Case 1, when `key = ['C']`, it is a list.
2. `key` is checked to not be list-like, but it is a list.
3. `key` is converted to a list in the next condition `key = list(key)`.
4. The next condition checks if `key` is an instance of an `Index`, which leads to a mismatch since `key` is a regular list.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, consider the following:
- Remove the unnecessary conversion of `key` to a list when it is already list-like.
- Adjust the conditions to handle lists properly by eliminating mismatches with other types.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = [key]  # Convert key to a list for consistent handling

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):  # Remove duplicate check, keep the uniformity
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the function `_get_with` should handle list inputs correctly and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post regarding inconsistent behavior with list indexers.
