### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition checking for `key_type == "integer"` may not accurately distinguish between positional and label-based indexing.
2. The handling of different types of `key` may not be consistent, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Bug Explanation
Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the buggy function fails to handle indexing with a list properly. When the input `key` is a list, the function does not process it correctly, resulting in a KeyError due to improper handling of the indexing. This behavior contradicts the expected output and causes the function to fail the tests.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the issue, the function `_get_with` needs to be updated to correctly handle indexing with a list. The key should be processed appropriately to ensure consistent behavior across different types of input key values. Additionally, the distinction between positional and label-based indexing needs to be refined for integer keys.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version should appropriately handle indexing with a list and ensure consistent behavior across different key types.
