### Issues in the Buggy Function:
1. The function `_get_with` in the `Series` class contains a bug related to how different types of indexers are handled. Specifically, it treats list indexers and non-list indexers differently, leading to inconsistent behavior.
2. The function incorrectly categorizes different types of keys, leading to wrong assumptions about their types and how they should be processed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers such as list indexers, numpy array indexers, and Index indexers. The function wrongly categorizes keys, leading to errors in deciding whether to treat them as positional or label-based indexers.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Implement a consistent handling approach for all types of indexers in the function `_get_with`.
2. Correctly categorize the keys to determine the appropriate method for indexing based on their characteristics.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `_get_with` function, all types of indexers will be handled consistently and appropriately categorized, ensuring correct indexing behavior in the `Series` class as intended.
