### Analysis:
1. The `_get_with` function is intended to handle different types of keys for indexing a `Series`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the handling of different types of keys and converting them to appropriate positional or label-based indexes. The `key_type` variable is determined incorrectly in some cases.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that the behavior of indexing a `Series` with list-like indexers is inconsistent, leading to KeyError in some cases.
4. The bug is likely related to how the key is processed and converted to the appropriate index type, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect determination of the `key_type`, especially when processing list-like keys. This incorrect determination leads to the wrong branch being followed in the code, resulting in KeyError or incorrect indexing.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure that the key_type is correctly inferred for list-like keys.
2. Handle different types of keys consistently to avoid KeyError and ensure proper indexing behavior.
3. Update the logic to handle list keys in a way that aligns with the expected behavior for all index types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that the key_type is correctly inferred for list-like keys and handles all types of keys consistently for proper indexing behavior.
