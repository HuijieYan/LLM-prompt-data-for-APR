### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The issue seems to arise from inconsistent behavior when using list indexers compared to other types of indexers, such as arrays or Index objects. The bug causes an incorrect determination of the `key_type`, leading to unexpected outcomes during indexing.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the handling of list indexers (`key`) within the `_get_with` function. When a list indexer is passed, the function incorrectly determines `key_type` as `'string'` regardless of the actual key type. This incorrect classification leads to the function taking the wrong route to return the result, causing failures.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for determining the `key_type` correctly based on the type of key provided. Specifically, we need to handle list indexers differently from other types of indexers to align the behavior with the intended functionality.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, extensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key types are correctly identified, especially when dealing with list indexers. By updating the logic to handle list-like keys differently, the function now properly determines the `key_type` and selects the appropriate path to return the desired results. This modification aligns the behavior with the expected outcomes and resolves the bug related to handling different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function of the Series class.
