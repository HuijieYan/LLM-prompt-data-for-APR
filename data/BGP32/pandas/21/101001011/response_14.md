### Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class of pandas, specifically when handling different types of key inputs, resulting in incorrect behavior when trying to access elements via a list-like key. The function encounters issues with identifying the type of the key input, which leads to the wrong index selection and subsequent errors.

### Bug Explanation
1. In Cases 1-3, for list-like keys (`list`, `ndarray`, or `Index` types), the function incorrectly identifies the `key_type` as `'string'`. This is due to the key type inference logic provided in the function, causing issues with treating the key as an index to select elements from the Series.
2. The function incorrectly handles the key type identification for list-like keys, leading to incorrect indexing operations on the Series data. This oversight results in an improper selection of data leading to errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function needs an improved key type inference mechanism for list-like keys to ensure proper indexing operations. Additionally, adjustments should be made to the branch logic for different key types to handle list-like keys appropriately.

### Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should address the bug by properly determining the key type for list-like keys and selecting elements from the Series accordingly.
