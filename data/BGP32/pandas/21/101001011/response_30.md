### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the improper handling of indexers like lists. In the provided cases, the key_type is incorrectly inferred as `'string'`, which leads to incorrect behavior when trying to access the elements in the Series. This bug is related to how different types of indexers are processed within the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the key_type inference mechanism needs to be optimized to correctly identify the type of the key being used for indexing. This will ensure that the appropriate action is taken based on the type of indexer passed to the function.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the key is first converted to an index using `ensure_index()` to ensure consistent handling. The inference of the key_type is done correctly to differentiate between different indexer types, improving the functionality of the `_get_with` method.
