### Bug Explanation:

The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of indexers (list indexers vs. array-like indexers) in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. When the `key` parameter passed to `_get_with` is of type `Index` or an array-like type, the function attempts to determine the `key_type` based on the inferred type of the key. However, the check for the key_type being `'integer'` triggers an incorrect branch, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Location:

The bug is primarily located in the logic that determines the `key_type` and decides whether to treat the indexer as a positional or label-based indexer.

### Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure correct identification of the `key_type` and appropriately handle the indexer based on its type to align with the expected behavior outlined in the GitHub issue. This involves adjusting the logic around determining the `key_type` and subsequent handling of different types of keys.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle different types of key
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Handle key based on inferred type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now correctly identifies the `key_type` and handles different types of keys based on their inferred types, aligning with the expected behavior from the GitHub issue.
