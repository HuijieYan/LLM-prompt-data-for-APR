### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The conversion of `key` to a list in the line `key = list(key)` can cause issues with certain input types.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. Due to the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)`, when the key is of type `Index` or other specific types, it gets passed to `self.loc[key]`, resulting in an inappropriate response. The conversion of `key` to a list using `key = list(key)` can also introduce unexpected behaviors, especially when dealing with various indexers.

### Fixing the Bug
To address the issue, it is necessary to align the behavior of different indexers in the `_get_with` function. Remove the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` and adjust the handling accordingly. Avoid converting `key` to a list, as this can introduce unintended consequences.

### Corrected Version of the `_get_with` Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By removing the `elif not is_list_like(key)` section and ensuring that `key` is handled correctly based on its type, the corrected function should now handle different indexers consistently and without errors.
