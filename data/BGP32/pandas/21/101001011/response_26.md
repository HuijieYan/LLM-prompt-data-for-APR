### Potential Error Locations
1. The conditional block handling the case when `key` is not list-like may not correctly handle scalars that are not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`.
2. The block checking if `key` is an instance of `Index` may lead to incorrect handling of key types.

### Bug Explanation
From the provided runtime values and types of variables, it is observed that the `key_type` is determined as `'string'` in all cases. This indicates that the logic defining `key_type` based on the inferred type of `key` is faulty.
When the key is a string-like object, the current implementation may wrongly categorize it as an integer indexer, which causes the issues seen in the failing cases.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to redefine how `key_type` is determined, specifically when handling string-like objects. Ensure that string-like objects are correctly recognized and categorized to avoid incorrect indexing behaviors.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif lib.is_scalar(key) and not lib.is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function includes a check for scalar values that are not recognized as boolean, ensuring that they are treated appropriately when indexing. This fix aims to address the issue of misclassified key types and ensure correct indexing behavior.
