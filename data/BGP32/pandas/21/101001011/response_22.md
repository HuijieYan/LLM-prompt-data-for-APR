### Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the `_get_with` function's handling of different types of indexers. When a key is passed as a list, it is not processed correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and potential errors. The buggy function fails to properly handle list indexers, causing unexpected outcomes based on the type of the key being passed. This issue is evident from the runtime values and types provided for the different cases, where the `key_type` is incorrectly identified as a string when encountering a list key.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list indexers are processed correctly within the `_get_with` function. By accurately determining the type of key being used and adjusting the logic accordingly, we can achieve consistent and expected behavior for different indexer types.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type if isinstance(key, Index) else lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
            if key_type == "integer":
                if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                    return self.loc[key]
                else:
                    return self.iloc[key]
            else:
                return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type")
```

This corrected version includes enhanced checks for different types of indexers, ensuring that list indexers are handled appropriately to avoid inconsistencies and errors.
