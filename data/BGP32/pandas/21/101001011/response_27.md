### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class of pandas is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. However, it fails to handle certain cases properly, leading to unexpected behavior. The reported GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in how different types of indexers are treated, specifically mentioning the difference between array-like indexers and list indexers.

### Identified Bug:
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, particularly the discrepancy in how list indexers are processed compared to other types like array-like indexers. The key issue is in the handling of indexing operations with a list indexer, which leads to unexpected errors.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To address this bug and ensure consistency in handling different indexer types, the `_get_with` function should be modified to correctly process list indexers similar to how array-like indexers are treated. This modification should align with the expectation of users based on intuitive behavior.

### Bug Fix:

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
        if not is_list_like(key):
            return self.loc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, (Index, np.ndarray)):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
            return self.loc[key]
    
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By making these changes, the `_get_with` function now treats list indexers consistently with other types of indexers, resolving the inconsistency reported in the GitHub issue. This fix ensures that all types of indexer inputs are handled uniformly, leading to more predictable and intuitive behavior for users.
