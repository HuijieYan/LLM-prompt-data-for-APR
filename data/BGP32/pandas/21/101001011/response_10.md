### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexing on a Series object.
2. The bug seems to be related to how different types of `key` inputs are processed and the resulting `key_type`.
3. The issue arises from incorrect handling of the `key` input when it is a list-like object, leading to inconsistent behavior compared to other indexers.
4. The current implementation lacks consistency in handling different types of indexers, causing unexpected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to inconsistent handling of list-like `key` inputs, leading to incorrect determination of `key_type` and subsequent incorrect index retrieval.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the handling of list-like `key` inputs should be made consistent with other indexers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `key_type` detection and subsequent index retrieval behavior are consistent across different types of indexers.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Handle list-like key inputs consistency
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "boolean":
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.loc[key]
```

In the corrected version, the function now consistently handles list-like `key` inputs by converting them into a list and determining `key_type` and subsequent index retrieval based on the type of the key. This approach ensures consistent behavior across different types of indexers.
