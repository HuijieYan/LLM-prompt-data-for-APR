### Potential Error Locations
1. The `key_type` variable might not be correctly assigned based on the type of `key`.
2. The logic for handling different types of `key` might not cover all necessary cases, leading to incorrect returns.
3. The decision between using positional indexer (`iloc`) or label-based index (`loc`) based on the inferred `key_type` could be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug
- In the given function, the determination of `key_type` might not be accurate based on the type of `key`, leading to incorrect branching in the code. This can result in returning unexpected outputs, especially when dealing with different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred based on the type of `key`.
- Revise the branching logic to cover all necessary cases for different types of `key` and handle them appropriately.
- Verify the decision-making process between positional and label-based indexing based on the inferred `key_type`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function taking into consideration the potential issues identified:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that `key_type` is accurately inferred, and the branching logic appropriately handles different types of `key`, supporting various indexers. It also considers the decision between positional and label-based indexing based on the `key_type`.
