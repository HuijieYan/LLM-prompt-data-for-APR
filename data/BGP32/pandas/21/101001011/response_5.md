### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `_get_with` attempts to handle different types of key inputs, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, scalars, and lists, for indexing a Series.
2. The issue stems from inconsistent behavior when indexing with lists compared to other indexers like arrays or Index objects.
3. The bug causes incorrect handling of list-like keys, leading to unexpected exceptions due to inconsistent behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that indexing with list-like keys is handled consistently and correctly according to the input type.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition where the key type is a list to ensure it is correctly handled and indexed.
2. Update the code to treat list-like keys consistently with other types of indexers, such as arrays and Index objects.
3. Implement a solution that aligns with expected behavior when indexing a Series using various key types.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that indexing a Series with list-like objects produces consistent and expected results, aligning with the desired behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
