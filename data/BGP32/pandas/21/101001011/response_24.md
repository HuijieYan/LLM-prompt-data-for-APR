### Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is responsible for handling different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The issue seems to be related to how different indexers are treated and the inconsistencies in behavior for list-like indexers.

### Bug:
The bug arises due to the function not handling list-like indexers properly, leading to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies when indexing a Series object.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check the type of the key to determine the appropriate action to take.
2. Ensure that list-like indexers are handled consistently to avoid unexpected behavior.
3. Consider the specifics of each key type and index accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key):
        # Handle scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function now properly handles list-like indexers, ensuring consistency in behavior. It distinguishes the type of key being used for indexing and takes the appropriate action accordingly. This fix aims to address the inconsistencies reported in the GitHub issue.
