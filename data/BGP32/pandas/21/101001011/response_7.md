### Bug Analysis
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class of the pandas library. The issue arises from treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers, causing inconsistencies in behavior.

In the provided cases, the bug involves identifying the type of the key and handling it accordingly. The `key_type` is incorrectly identified as 'string' when it should differentiate between 'string', 'integer', 'boolean', etc.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency in behavior between list indexers and array-like indexers, pointing out the unexpected behavior when using a list indexer where a KeyError is raised due to not finding any matches in the index.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrectly identifying the type of the key used for indexing. The function fails to properly categorize the key as a list or other types like 'integer' or 'boolean', leading to incorrect handling and inconsistent behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to accurately determine the type of the key used for indexing. We should differentiate between list indexers, array-like indexers, and other types like 'integer', 'boolean', etc., to ensure consistent behavior and proper indexing functionality.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version identifies the type of the key accurately to handle list indexers, array-like indexers, and other types appropriately. By ensuring the correct categorization of the key, the function should exhibit consistent behavior across different types of indexers and resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
