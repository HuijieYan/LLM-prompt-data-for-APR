## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function when the input `key` is a list-like object. The function is designed to handle various types of keys, like slices, DataFrames, tuples, and lists, but there is a logic error in the handling of list-like keys. When the input `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, the function attempts to access the location `self.loc[key]`, assuming that `key` is a valid key for indexing the Series. However, this assumption can lead to a TypeError if `key` is not a valid index for the Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for handling list-like keys. Instead of directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should check if the key is a valid index for the Series before attempting to access it. If the key is not valid, we can raise a more informative KeyError to indicate the issue with the input key.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        raise KeyError(f"Key '{key}' is not a valid index for the Series")

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes a check for validating the list-like key before attempting to access it directly. If the key is not a valid index, a KeyError will be raised with a meaningful error message.
