## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` takes a `key` parameter and performs different operations based on the type of `key`. The issue lies in the logic for handling different types of keys, particularly in the case where `key` is not recognized as a list-like object.

The bug occurs because the function tries to directly access `self.loc[key]` without proper type handling or checking.

## Bug Cause
When the `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, the function tries to access `self.loc[key]` directly. However, this could lead to unexpected behavior if `key` is not compatible with direct indexing.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should handle the case where `key` is not recognized as a list-like object properly. This may involve performing additional checks and conversions to ensure that direct indexing with `self.loc[key]` is appropriate.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim == 1:
        return self.loc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, (ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        # Handle cases where key is an ExtensionArray, Series, or Index
        return self.loc[key]

    else:
        # For other cases, fallback to reindex
        return self.reindex(key)
``` 

This corrected version includes handling for various types of `key` inputs, ensuring appropriate indexing operations based on the type of `key`. The changes made aim to address the bug by providing more robust type handling and compatibility checks before accessing `self.loc[key]`.
