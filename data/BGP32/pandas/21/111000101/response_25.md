## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when the input `key` is a list-like object that is not recognized as a scalar. The function attempts to handle this case by checking if the `key` is an instance of certain types, such as `Index`, and then infers the type of the key. However, the bug arises from the fact that if the `key` is a list, the function incorrectly handles it as a single key value, which leads to a misinterpretation of the key type.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to correctly handle the case when the `key` variable is a list-like object. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of each element in the list and processes it accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_list_like(key):
        if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)

        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
        # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        if key_type == "integer":
            # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
            #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function includes the necessary changes to properly handle the case when the `key` variable is a list-like object. It correctly identifies the type of each element in the list and processes it accordingly to determine the key type and return the appropriate result.
