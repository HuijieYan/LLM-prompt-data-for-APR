## Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. However, there is a bug in the logic when determining the `key_type` which leads to incorrect outcomes in certain cases.

1. The bug occurs in the section where the `key_type` is determined based on the type of `key`. The issue lies in the following condition:
   ```python
   if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
   ```
   Here, if `key` is an `Index` object, it is supposed to get the `inferred_type` from `key`. However, this condition prevents the correct retrieval of the `key_type` for `Index` objects, leading to incorrect handling of indexing.

2. The `key_type` is vital for deciding whether to use label-based indexing (`loc`) or positional indexing (`iloc`). The incorrect detection of `key_type` can result in the wrong indexing method being employed, causing unpredictable behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the condition that determines the `key_type` to accurately handle `Index` objects. By ensuring that the correct `key_type` is determined for all types of keys, we can resolve the issue with how indexing is performed.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = None
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    if key_type is None:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By including a null check for `key_type` and properly setting `key_type` based on whether `key` is an `Index` object or inferring the type, we ensure that the correct type is used to determine the indexing method. This correction should resolve the bug and provide the expected results for the given test cases.
