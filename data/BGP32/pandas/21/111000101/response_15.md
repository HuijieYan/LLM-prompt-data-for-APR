### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` input parameter. When the `key` parameter is not recognized as a list-like data structure, the function tries to access it using `self.loc[key]`, which leads to the error. The bug is specifically related to the logic for handling non-list-like keys and the subsequent indexing operation.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to modify the logic for handling different types of keys. We should ensure that the key is properly processed based on its data type before attempting any indexing operation. The fix should involve correcting the condition checking for non-list-like keys and adjusting the code accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now properly handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate indexing operation based on the input type.
