The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `key` parameter when it is not recognized as a list-like object. The function mistakenly attempts to access the `loc` attribute of the Series object directly, leading to errors in the case where `key` is supposed to be a scalar but is not recognized as such due to its type.

To fix this bug, we should modify the handling of non-list-like `key` objects by directly converting them into a list before proceeding with further operations. This approach ensures that we correctly handle scalar values as well.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]  # Convert non-list-like key to a list

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version adjusts the handling of non-list-like `key` objects by converting them into a list before continuing with further processing. This adjustment ensures that scalar values are correctly handled and eliminates potential errors that arise from the incorrect type recognition of the `key` parameter.
