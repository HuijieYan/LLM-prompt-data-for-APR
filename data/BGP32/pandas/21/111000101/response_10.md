The bug in the `_get_with` function arises when the function tries to determine the type of the key provided for indexing the Series. There are some issues in handling different types of keys such as lists, scalars, Index, and other data structures. The bug leads to incorrect determination of the key type, affecting the indexing mechanism.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the key type is correctly inferred and that the indexing is done based on the type of key provided.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, list, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
```

The corrected version ensures that the key type is correctly determined and based on the type of the key, it performs the indexing operation. This version should now correctly handle different types of keys and return the expected output for the provided test cases.

Please test this corrected version with the provided test cases to ensure it functions as expected. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
