### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of `key` inputs to perform indexing operations on a Series object. However, there is a bug in the logic that determines how the key should be handled.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `key` input and incorrectly inferring the data type of the key. This leads to incorrect indexing behavior, especially when the key is not recognized as a list-like or scalar input.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `_get_with` function, we need to correctly identify the type of the `key` input and handle it accordingly. We should ensure that the key is correctly processed as either label-based indexing or positional indexing depending on its type and content. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the key is not recognized as list-like or scalar input.

### Corrected Version
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "string":
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the `_get_with` function should now correctly handle different types of `key` inputs and perform the appropriate indexing operations based on the type of the key. It addresses the bug by checking the data type of the key and handling it accordingly.
