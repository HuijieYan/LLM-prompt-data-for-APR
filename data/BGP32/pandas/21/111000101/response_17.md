Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the expected input/output values, it seems that the bug lies in the logic that determines the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function. The function is not correctly identifying the type of the key in some cases, which leads to incorrect behavior during indexing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined based on the type of the `key` parameter. The key should be categorized into different types such as 'string' or 'integer'.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy _get_with function
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # i.e. self.iloc or label-based i.e. self.loc
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if is_list_like(key):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the issue of determining the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` parameter. It should now correctly handle the different types of keys and return the expected values and types according to the provided test cases.
