### Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of input keys and return the corresponding values from the Series. The bug seems to be occurring when dealing with the `key_type` identification and the subsequent indexing based on that type.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the variable `key_type` is inferred incorrectly in some cases, leading to incorrect decision-making in choosing whether to use positional or label-based indexing. This results in the wrong output being returned from the function.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for all types of keys being passed to the function. We should also make sure that the indexing method (`iloc` or `loc`) is selected appropriately based on the inferred key type.

### Corrected Version

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer" and not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
        return self.loc[key]
    elif key_type == "integer":
        return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version ensures that the `key_type` is correctly inferred for all cases and uses the appropriate indexing method based on the inferred key type.
