### Bug analysis
The bug in the `_get_with` function occurs when determining the `key_type` for the given `key`. The key is checked for its type, and based on the type, different actions are taken. The bug is likely related to the `lib.infer_dtype` function, which is used to determine the type of the `key`.

The function fails to correctly identify the type of the key, leading to incorrect branching in the code and possibly returning an unexpected result.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `key_type` is correctly determined based on the type of the `key`. We should also make sure that the correct action is taken for each identified type. To address the issue of incorrect type inference, we might need to enhance the logic for determining the type of the `key`.

### Corrected function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_scalar(key):
            key_type = 'scalar'
        elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray)):
            key_type = 'array'
        else:
            key_type = 'unknown'

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding an additional check for scalar type keys and improving the logic for determining the key type based on the input key, this corrected function should handle different types of keys more accurately and provide the expected behavior in the various cases outlined.
