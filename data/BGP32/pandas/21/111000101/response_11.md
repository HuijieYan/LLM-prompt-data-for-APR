## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle various types of keys for indexing a `Series`. The bug occurs when the `key` provided is a scalar and not recognized by the `is_list_like` function, resulting in a wrong branch execution and returning incorrect results.

### Bug Explanation
When the `key` is not recognized as a list-like object, the code incorrectly falls back to using `key` as a label for location-based indexing using `self.loc[key]`. This default behavior is wrong when dealing with scalars as keys since it should be treated as positional indexing.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle scalar keys as positional indexing instead of falling back to label-based indexing. This can be achieved by adding a check for scalar keys and returning the `iloc` value instead of `loc` in that case.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):  # Check if key is scalar
        return self.iloc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
After fixing the bug, the function now correctly handles scalar keys by using `iloc` instead of `loc` for positional indexing. This change ensures that scalars are treated appropriately during indexing operations in the `Series` class.
