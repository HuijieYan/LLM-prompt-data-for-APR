The buggy function `_get_with` is meant to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object. The bug in the function lies in the condition where it checks if the key is an instance of `Index`. This condition is incorrect because the check should be for `is_list_like(key)` rather than `isinstance(key, Index)`.

The cause of the bug is that `key` might be a list or another data structure that is list-like but not necessarily an instance of the `Index` class. Therefore, the current condition `isinstance(key, Index)` is too restrictive and leads to an incorrect branch being taken.

To fix the bug, the condition checking for the key type should be revised to `if is_list_like(key):` instead of `if isinstance(key, Index):`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):  # Fixed condition here
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the condition to check for list-like objects, the corrected version of the function now properly handles various types of keys for indexing the Series object.
