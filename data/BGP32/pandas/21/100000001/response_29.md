The buggy function `_get_with` contains several potential error locations:
1. The condition `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` is incorrect as it checks if `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which is not intended.
2. The elif block `elif not is_list_like(key):` assumes that non-list-like `key` values are scalar and tries to access `self.loc[key]`, which can cause an error.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` does not consider the case where `key` is a list of values and not an instance of `Index`.
4. The handling of the `key_type == "integer"` case is ambiguous and may lead to incorrect behavior when deciding between positional or label-based indexing.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to revise the conditional statements and clarify the logic for handling different types of `key`. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series)) or isinstance(key, (Index, list) and all(is_scalar(x) for x in key)):
        key_type = "scalar"
    elif isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if all(is_scalar(x) for x in key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- The handling of non-list-like `key` values has been revised to first check if the value is a scalar, then proceed accordingly.
- The logic for determining `key_type` has been adjusted to accommodate different types of `key`, including scalar values.
- The ambiguous handling of `key_type == "integer"` has been revised to improve the decision-making process based on the context of the operation.
