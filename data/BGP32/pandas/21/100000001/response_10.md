## Analysis:
- The function `_get_with` is used to get values based on the input `key` for a Series.
- The function checks the type of `key` and performs specific actions based on its type.
- There are several conditional blocks to handle different types of keys, such as slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, etc.
- The bug appears to be related to the logic for checking the type of `key` and the subsequent actions taken based on that type.

## Potential Error Locations:
- The bug might be in the conditional blocks where the type of `key` is checked.
- The bug could also be related to the incorrect handling of the key type, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug could be caused by incorrect type checking and handling of the `key` input.
- The function might not correctly identify the type of `key` and apply the appropriate logic.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Properly identify the type of `key` and handle each type appropriately to ensure the correct behavior.
- Check for any inconsistencies in type checking and handling logic and address them accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):  # Fixed to handle both ABCDataFrame and ABCSeries
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):  # Removed Series from this check
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):  # Removed unnecessary key_type check
        return self.loc[key]

    if lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False) == "integer":   # Simplified the key_type check
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- Fixed handling of `ABCDataFrame` and `ABCSeries`.
- Simplified the type checking logic for `integer` type.
- Avoided unnecessary key_type check.
- Adjusted the type check for `list` type before reindexing.

With these corrections, the function should correctly handle different types of keys and perform the appropriate actions based on the input.
