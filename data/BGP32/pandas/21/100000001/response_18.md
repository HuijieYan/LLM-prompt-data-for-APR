## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of input `key` for indexing a Series. The function checks the type of `key` and performs specific operations accordingly. However, there are a few issues in the function that need to be addressed:

1. The `if` condition for checking `key` as `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` is incorrect as it should be checking for `Pandas DataFrame` instead.
2. The `elif not is_list_like(key)` condition may result in the wrong behavior as it tries to access `self.loc[key]`.
3. The handling of `list`, `Index`, and other iterable types of keys is not consistent.

## Bug Cause:
The bug can arise due to incorrect type checking for DataFrame, inconsistent handling of different key types, and potential errors when passing a non-list-like key to the `self.loc` method.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function `_get_with`, we need to:
1. Change the check for DataFrame type to correctly identify DataFrame inputs.
2. Ensure consistent handling of different key types and avoid errors when dealing with non-list-like keys.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    elif isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the duplicate indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version fixes the issues with type checking, ensures consistent key handling, and avoids potential errors when using non-list-like keys.
