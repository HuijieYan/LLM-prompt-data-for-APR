The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of key inputs for indexing a Series object. The function is supposed to determine the type of key input and perform the corresponding indexing operation. However, there are several potential error locations in the function that can lead to incorrect behavior or raise exceptions.

1. The first potential error location is in the `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` block. The intention seems to be to handle cases where a DataFrame is used for indexing a Series, but the condition check is incorrect. Instead of `ABCDataFrame`, it should check for `ABCIndex`.

2. The check `elif isinstance(key, tuple):` is appropriate for handling tuple inputs.

3. The `elif not is_list_like(key):` block is meant to handle scalar values but the implementation is incorrect. It should likely return `self.loc[key]` for scalar inputs.

4. The logic block for handling different types of key inputs and determining the indexing method (positional or label-based) is quite complex and might contain bugs that could lead to incorrect indexing behavior.

5. The function does not handle the case properly where the key is not recognized as a valid data structure for indexing.

To fix the buggy function, we should:
- Correct the condition check for DataFrame indexing to `elif isinstance(key, ABCIndex):`
- Ensure proper handling of scalar inputs in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block
- Simplify the logic for determining the key type and indexing method
- Improve the error handling for unrecognized key structures

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice objects
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCIndex):  # handle indexing with Index objects
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with Index is not supported, use values"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):  # handle tuple indexing
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):  # handle scalar values
        return self.loc[key]  # assume loc method should be used for scalar values

    # Convert key to list if not already an appropriate structure for indexing
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Determine whether to use positional or label-based indexing based on key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]  # handle dup indexing case
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
- The condition for DataFrame indexing is replaced with `elif isinstance(key, ABCIndex):`
- Proper handling of scalar values is included in the `elif not is_list_like(key):` block
- The indexing logic is simplified for better readability and maintenance
- The function should now handle different types of key inputs more effectively.
