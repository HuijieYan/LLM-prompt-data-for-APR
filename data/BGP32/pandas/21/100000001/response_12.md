## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with(self, key)` is intended for handling various types of keys for indexing a Series in pandas. The function tries to determine the type of `key` and then perform the indexing operation accordingly. However, there are several issues within this function that need to be addressed:

1. The `isinstance(key, slice)` block is used to handle slice objects, but the conversion of slice indexers might not be correct.
2. The `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` block raises a `TypeError`, indicating that indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported. This check should be handled differently.
3. The conversion of different types of keys (`tuple`, `list`, `np.ndarray`, etc.) is not consistent, and there are potential issues in determining the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`).
4. There are inconsistencies in checking the type of `key` (e.g., checking for `Index` type and `list` type), which may lead to unexpected behavior.


## Bug Cause:
The bug in the function arises from the inconsistent handling of different types of keys for indexing. The function doesn't correctly determine the appropriate indexing method (`loc` or `iloc`) based on the key type, leading to potential errors and unexpected behavior during indexing operations.


## Fixing Strategy:
1. Ensure proper handling of slice indexers by validating the conversion of slice objects.
2. Modify the check for `ABCDataFrame` to handle DataFrame indexing differently instead of raising an error.
3. Implement a consistent approach for converting and determining the indexing method for different key types.
4. Simplify and unify the checks for key types to avoid confusion and unexpected behavior.


## Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind='getitem')
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == 'integer':
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- The issue with slice indexers conversion is addressed by ensuring proper handling of slice objects.
- The check for `ABCDataFrame` is kept the same, but it can be modified based on the actual requirement.
- Consistent conversion and determination of the indexing method for different key types are implemented.
- The checks for key types are simplified to avoid confusion and potential bugs.
