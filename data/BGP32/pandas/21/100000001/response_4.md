There are a few potential error locations in the buggy function `_get_with`:

1. The condition `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` is checking if the `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, which is not a common data structure to index a Series. This condition should be removed or changed to handle a more relevant data type.
   
2. In the line `return self.reindex(key)`, there is a potential issue as it tries to reindex the Series with the `key`, which might not always work correctly.

The buggy function might result in errors when trying to index a Series with a DataFrame or an unsupported key type like `ABCDataFrame`.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove or modify the condition `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` to handle key types that are common for indexing Series.
2. Replace `return self.reindex(key)` with a proper method to handle indexing with the given key.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # If none of the above conditions hold, return the Series indexed with `key`
    return self.loc[key]
```

This corrected version addresses the potential issues mentioned earlier and should work properly for indexing a Series with various key types.
