## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing a Series object in pandas. The function checks the type of the key and performs different operations based on the key type. The bug appears in the section where the function checks if the key is an instance of `Index` and attempts to assign `key_type` based on this condition.

## Bug Location:
The bug is located in the following block of code:
```python
if isinstance(key, Index):
    key_type = key.inferred_type
else:
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
```
The issue arises when trying to check if `key` is an instance of `Index`, which does not work as intended.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional check `if isinstance(key, Index):` is not the correct way to determine if `key` is of type `Index`. The `Index` class is not being appropriately imported in the buggy function, leading to the bug.

## Fixing Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to import the `Index` class appropriately in the function to enable the correct checking of the key type. We should include the following import statement:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index
```

## Corrected Version:
```python
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index

def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)

```
