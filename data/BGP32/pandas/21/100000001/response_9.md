The buggy function `_get_with` has several potential error locations that might lead to incorrect behavior:
1. The function checks if `key` is a slice, and if so, tries to convert it into a positional or label-based slice. This conversion might not work as expected.
2. The function checks if `key` is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, but this check seems unnecessary for indexing a Series.
3. The function tries to handle different cases based on the type of `key`, but the logic for handling non-list-like and non-integer keys might not cover all edge cases.
4. There is a mix of checks for list, ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, and Index types that might lead to ambiguous behavior.

To fix the bug, the function's logic can be simplified to properly handle different types of keys for indexing a Series. The following corrected version of the function addresses the potential issues:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    if isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = ensure_index(key)  # Ensure key is an Index type for proper reindexing

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version:
1. The function handles different key types more consistently and explicitly handles scalars.
2. It ensures that `key` is converted to an Index type for proper indexing.
3. The function simplifies the logic for handling different key types while maintaining clarity and consistency.
