The buggy function provided is `_get_with` which is used for indexing in a Pandas Series. 

Here are the identified potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The comparison `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` should be `if isinstance(key, ABCSeries):` as we are dealing with indexing a Pandas Series, not a DataFrame.
2. The condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):` doesn't cover the case when `key` is an indexing scalar, which leads to using the `.loc` method incorrectly.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` might not correctly infer the key type if the variable `key` is an instance of a specific Index class.

The bug in this function arises from incorrect type checking and handling of different types of indexing `key`. To fix this bug, we will follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the correct type check is performed for indexing with a Series (`ABCDataFrame` is replaced with `ABCSeries` in the second conditional block).
2. Address the issue in the type check block by covering all possible cases for indexing, including scalars.
3. Improve the type inference logic to handle all types of Index instances correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
# corrected version of the buggy function

def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with Series is not supported, use the appropriate Series index"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if lib.is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

In this corrected version, we have fixed the identified issues, including the type check for indexing with a Series, handling indexing scalars correctly, and improving the type inference logic for Index instances.
