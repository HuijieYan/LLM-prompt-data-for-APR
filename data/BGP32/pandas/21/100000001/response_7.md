The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The function aims to determine the type of the key and perform the appropriate indexing operation based on that type.

Here are the potential error locations within the function:
1. In the initial implementation, the function incorrectly checks if the key is an instance of `ABCDataFrame` which is not a valid comparison for indexing.
2. There is a redundancy in checking for the type of `key` before converting it to a list in the `if` statement. This can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The type inference logic for `key_type` might not cover all cases accurately.

The cause of the bug:
The `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` check is incorrect because it attempts to index a Series using a DataFrame which is not supported. This condition is a mistake in the original code.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the condition `elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` as it is invalid for indexing a Series.
2. Refactor the logic for determining the type of the `key` parameter to ensure that it covers all cases accurately.
3. Simplify the logic and remove redundancy in the function.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version improves the error handling and simplifies the code logic for key indexing in a Series object.
