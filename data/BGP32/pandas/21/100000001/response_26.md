The bug in the provided function `_get_with` lies in the conditional checks where it is incorrectly handling the input key passed to the function. 

1. The bug arises mainly due to the wrong condition checks and handling of different data types for the `key`. 

2. The function incorrectly checks for `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` which should be replaced with `isinstance(key, ABCSeries)` as we are dealing with Series objects rather than DataFrames in this context.

3. Additionally, the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` might be problematic as it checks for a specific set of types which could potentially miss some valid key types.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Replace the incorrect check `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` with `isinstance(key, ABCSeries)` for handling Series objects.
   - Refine the condition `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index))` to cover a broader range of valid key types.
   - Ensure that the type checks align with the intended behavior of the function.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCSeries):  # Corrected type check for Series
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with another Series is not "
            "supported, use appropriate operations for Series objects"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):  # Refine condition for list-like types
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By addressing the incorrect type check and refining the conditions for valid key types, the corrected function should handle different input key types appropriately and avoid the potential bugs present in the original implementation.
