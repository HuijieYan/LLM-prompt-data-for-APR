## Analysis:
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of input keys for indexing a Series object. The function is primarily checking the type of the input key and then determining the appropriate method for retrieving values from the Series.

## Potential Errors:
1. The `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):` condition is incorrectly checking for an instance of `ABCDataFrame` which is not a typical use case for indexing a Series object with a DataFrame.
2. The check `elif not is_list_like(key):` might not handle certain types of scalars properly.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, Index):` might not work as expected and could lead to potential issues during runtime.
4. The logic for handling different key types like integers or lists is not consistent and may result in unexpected behavior.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function arises from the incorrect expectation of input key types. The function incorrectly handles cases where the input key is an instance of `ABCDataFrame`, and the handling of scalar key types might be flawed, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing the Series object.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary check for `ABCDataFrame` type in the function.
2. Refactor the logic for handling scalar keys to ensure all scalar types are properly handled.
3. Revise the logic for determining the key type to avoid unexpected behavior.
4. Standardize the method of handling different key types to ensure consistency and avoid potential errors.

## Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, unnecessary conditionals are removed, and the handling of different key types is standardized for consistency. The function now properly handles different input key types and should avoid unexpected behavior when indexing the Series object.
