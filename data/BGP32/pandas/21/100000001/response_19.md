### Analysis:
It seems that the `key` parameter in the `_get_with` function is being checked in multiple if-elif conditions to determine the appropriate action to take. However, there are several potential error locations in the function:
1. The check for `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` should be `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` instead.
2. The check for `if isinstance(key, tuple)` should be changed to `if isinstance(key, tuple) and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple))` to avoid ambiguity with lists.
3. The condition `if isinstance(key, Index)` should not be used as intended because it is prone to erroneous results.
4. Some repeated checks in the function could be optimized to enhance readability.

### Bug Cause:
The main cause of the bug in this function is the incorrect check for `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` where `isinstance` should have been used instead. This bug causes an error to be raised when attempting to index a Series with a DataFrame.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Change the check form `if isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)` to `isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame)`.
2. Adjust the condition for checking tuples to exclude lists and tuples.
3. Optimize the repeated checks in the function for better code efficiency.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple) and not isinstance(key, (list, tuple)):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
