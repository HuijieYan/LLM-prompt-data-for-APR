## Analyzing the buggy function:
- The function `_get_with(self, key)` is designed to handle indexing operations for a Pandas Series.
- The function contains multiple conditional statements to handle different types of indexing keys.
- The bug appears to be related to the handling of the `key_type` variable and the subsequent decision-making based on it.
- The function returns a result based on the type of the `key`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the `key_type` variable.
2. Issues with type conversions and checks for `key`.
3. Inconsistencies in conditional logic for different `key` types.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug likely arises from a mismatch in the handling of different types of `key` inputs in the function. The decision-making based on the `key_type` variable may not be correctly identifying the type of the key in some cases, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure consistency in type conversions and checks for the `key`.
2. Clarify the conditional logic to handle different `key` types appropriately.
3. Debug the `key_type` assignment and its subsequent usage to determine the exact cause of the bug.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif key_type == "boolean":
            return self.loc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version:
- The `is_scalar` function is added to the condition for handling scalar keys.
- The `key_type` assignment is placed inside the conditional block to ensure it is correctly assigned based on `key` type.
- The conditional logic for handling `key_type` and different types of `key` values is updated for clarity and appropriateness.

By addressing these issues and clarifying the conditional logic, the corrected version should handle different types of `key` inputs accurately.
