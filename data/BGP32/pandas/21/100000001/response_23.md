The buggy function has a logical issue when determining how to handle different types of input keys. The main problem arises when checking the `key_type` of the input `key` variable and deciding whether to use positional indexing `iloc` or label-based indexing `loc`.

The bug is caused by the following line of code:
```python
if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
    key = list(key)
```

This check incorrectly converts a non-list-like object to a list, leading to potential issues when checking the `key_type`. This conversion disrupts the logic flow of the function and may cause unexpected outcomes.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic of the function to properly handle different types of keys and avoid unnecessary conversions.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the `is_list_like(key)` check has been replaced with `is_scalar(key)` to correctly handle scalar inputs without converting them to lists unnecessarily. Additionally, the logic for handling different key types has been adjusted to avoid errors and ensure the function operates as intended.
