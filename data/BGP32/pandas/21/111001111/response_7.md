The issue in the buggy function arises from how different indexers are handled, specifically for list-like indexers. The function `_get_with` checks the type of the key and appropriately processes it based on the type. However, there is inconsistency in how list-like keys are handled compared to other types. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior when accessing elements using lists, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like indexers are treated consistently with other indexers. We can modify the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list-like keys in a way that aligns with the behavior of other key types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version ensures that list-like indexers are handled consistently with other types. By using `ensure_index` for list-like keys, we convert them into an appropriate index type for further processing. This approach resolves the inconsistency identified in the GitHub issue and aligns the behavior of different indexers when accessing elements in a Series.
