The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the way different types of indexers are handled. The function fails to appropriately process a list indexer, leading to incorrect behavior. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the handling of list-like indexers to align with the expected behavior.

1. Analysis:
   - The `_get_with` function in the `Series` class is responsible for processing various types of indexers to retrieve values.
   - The bug occurs when dealing with a list-like indexer, where the function does not handle it correctly, leading to unexpected results.
   - The runtime input/output values provided indicate discrepancies in the outcome of the function based on the type of key being used.
   - The expected values show the desired behavior for each case and highlight the need for correct handling of list-like indexers.
   - The GitHub issue further emphasizes the inconsistency in how different indexers are treated, particularly the difference in behavior between list-like and other indexers.
   
2. Bug Cause:
   The bug arises from the incomplete and incorrect handling of list-like indexers within the `_get_with` function. When dealing with list indexers, the function fails to process them correctly, causing unexpected errors or results.

3. Bug Fix Strategy:
   To fix the bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers, including list-like indexers, are handled consistently and appropriately. This involves updating the logic in the `_get_with` function to correctly process list indexers and align with the expected behavior described in the failing test cases.

4. Corrected Version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    key = list(key)  # Convert key to list for consistent processing

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # Handle list indexer case correctly
    return self.loc[key]
```

By updating the logic in the `_get_with` function as shown above, we ensure that list indexers are processed correctly, addressing the bug and aligning the behavior with the expected results.
