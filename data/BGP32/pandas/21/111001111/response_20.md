### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is supposed to handle different types of keys used for indexing a Series object. The bug arises due to inconsistency in how list-like keys are processed compared to other types of keys.

In the provided cases, the `key_type` is set to `'string'` regardless of the input `key`, which is incorrect and causing the function to return results that do not align with the expected behavior.

The GitHub issue highlights the inconsistency and failure when indexing a Series with a list key compared to other types of keys.

### Bug Explanation
1. The function misidentifies the `key_type` as `'string'` disallowing it to differentiate between list-like keys and other types of keys.
2. This misclassification leads to incorrect indexing decisions and subsequent wrong results for list-like keys.
3. Inconsistent behavior when handling list keys compared to other types of keys is the root cause of the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug:
1. Update the logic to correctly identify the type of `key` passed for indexing.
2. Ensure that list-like keys are handled consistently with other types of keys to maintain expected behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_bool(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index.is_type_compatible(key):
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected function should properly handle the different types of keys for indexing a Series object, ensuring consistent behavior and aligning with the expected results for all input cases.
