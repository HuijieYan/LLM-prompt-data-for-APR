## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class within the pandas library. The function is designed to handle different types of keys for indexing, but it fails to correctly handle the case where the key is a list. The issue arises due to inconsistencies in how list indexers are treated compared to other array-like indexers.

When a list key is passed to the function, the code is expected to treat it correctly for indexing the Series. However, the function does not handle this case properly, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors. This inconsistency in handling list indexers can be seen in the GitHub issue description, where a KeyError is raised specifically for the list indexer case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle list key indexers. The function should treat list key indexers in a consistent manner with other array-like indexers to avoid the KeyError and ensure that the indexing operation proceeds smoothly.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to treat list key indexers consistently with other array-like indexers, we ensure that the indexing operation remains robust and handles all types of keys appropriately.
