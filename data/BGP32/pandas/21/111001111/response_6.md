The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle cases where the key is a list type. The function incorrectly expects the key to be a recognized type, leading to errors in certain scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_with` function to properly handle list indexers. We can update the section of the code that deals with non-list-like keys to include a check for list indexers as well. By treating list indexers appropriately, we can align the behavior with other types of indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers as a separate case
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the check for list indexers and routing them correctly to the `self.loc` method, we can ensure that list indexers are handled consistently with other types of indexers. This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and align the behavior of the function with the expected input/output values provided in the failing test cases.
