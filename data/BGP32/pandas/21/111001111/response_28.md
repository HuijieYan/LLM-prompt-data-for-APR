The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in treating list indexers differently from array-like indexers. This results in unexpected behavior when using a list as an indexer, causing errors or incorrect returns.

### Error Locations:
1. The section that handles indexers other than slice, DataFrame, and tuple.
2. The condition where the key type is inferred as "integer" but not properly handled.

### Cause of the Bug:
In the provided cases:
- Case 1: The key is a list causing the inference of `'string'` as the key type.
- Case 2: The key is an array of objects leading to the same inference.
- Case 3: The key inferred type is `'string'`.
- Case 4: The key is a Series which should be treated as a string but errors during inference.

The bug originates from not handling the cases where the key is a list correctly, leading to the incorrect inference of the key type. This causes the function to fail to return the expected values.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we should modify how list-like key types are handled in the `_get_with` function. We need to ensure that the key type is correctly inferred and that list-like keys are appropriately processed to return the expected outputs.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key_list = list(key) if not is_list_like(key) else key

    if not isinstance(key_list, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_list = [key_list]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key_list, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles list-like key types appropriately and ensures that the key type is inferred correctly, thus addressing the bug and aligning the function's behavior with the expected output.
