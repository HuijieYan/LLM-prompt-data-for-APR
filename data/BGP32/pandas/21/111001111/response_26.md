### Bug Analysis
The buggy function `_get_with` is designed to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and various list-like objects. The bug seems to manifest when the `key` parameter is a list-like object that represents an indexer for the Series.

Looking at the code, there seems to be an issue when `key` is not recognized as list-like, resulting in an attempt to access the element via `self.loc[key]`. This logic might be incorrect because the `key` was expected to be a list-like object and needs to be handled appropriately.

The runtime analysis shows that for all input cases, the `key_type` variable is set to `'string'` before the return, indicating that when the key is not recognized as list-like, the function attempts to access it as a string from the index.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the handling of non-list-like `key` objects in the `_get_with` function to correctly address the expected behavior. We can check if the `key` is not recognized as list-like and handle it distinctively based on the behavior expected for such cases.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]  # Handle scalar values as loc indexers
        raise NotImplementedError("Handling non-list-like keys is not implemented")  # Handle other non-list-like keys

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version of the function, we provide distinct handling for non-list-like keys by using `loc` to index the Series if the key is a scalar value or raising a `NotImplementedError` for other non-list-like keys. This adjustment addresses the issue of incorrectly handling non-list-like keys and should align with the correct behavior for the buggy function.
