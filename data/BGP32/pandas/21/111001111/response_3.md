## Bug Fix Strategy
The issue seems to relate to the inconsistency in how different indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. 

Based on the cases provided, it appears that the bug arises when dealing with certain types of key inputs, leading to incorrect inference of the key type as string, which can be problematic downstream in the function logic.

To resolve this issue:
1. Ensure that the key type is correctly inferred for all types of input keys.
2. Handle different types of keys appropriately to maintain consistent behavior.

By addressing these points, the function should work correctly for various types of key inputs and return the expected results in all scenarios.

## Bug-Free Version
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
    def _get_with(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
            return self._slice(slobj)
        elif isinstance(key, tuple):
            return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
            raise TypeError(
                "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
                "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
            )
        elif not is_list_like(key):
            # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
            return self.loc[key]
        
        if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
            key = list(key)
        
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        
        if key_type in ['integer', 'string', 'boolean']:  # Correct key type inference
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        
        if isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By incorporating the changes described in the bug fix strategy above, the updated function should now handle different types of keys properly and produce the expected results in all scenarios.
