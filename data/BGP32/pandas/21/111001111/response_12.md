The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of the key parameter when it is not list-like. This causes unexpected behavior when dealing with different data types for the key parameter leading to incorrect results.

The bug occurs when a Series object is being accessed using a key that is not list-like. In these cases, the function tries to determine the type of the key and select the indexing method based on that type. However, the logic for handling various types of keys is flawed, which results in incorrect outcomes.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to better handle non-list-like keys, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the key's type.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Check if key is not list-like
    if not is_list_like(key):
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version includes proper handling of key types that are not list-like, ensuring consistent behavior when accessing the Series object with various types of keys. It addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue by providing a more robust approach to key indexing.
