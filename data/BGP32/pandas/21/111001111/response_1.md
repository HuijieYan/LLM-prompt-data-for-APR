The issue arises from the `_get_with` function in the `Series` class where different types of indexers are not handled consistently, leading to unexpected behaviors. The function tries to handle different types of keys, but there are inconsistencies in the treatment of indexers, especially when dealing with strings.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all types of indexers are handled consistently and the behavior aligns with the expected functionalities of a Series when using different types of keys for indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type in ["integer", "string"]:
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle the case where the key type is a string in addition to integers. This ensures that the behavior of the function is consistent and aligns with the expected use cases of indexing a Series.
