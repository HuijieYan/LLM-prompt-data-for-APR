Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to how the different types of indexers are handled in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. Specifically, the function fails to correctly handle the case when `key` is a list-like object. The logic branching for list-like objects seems to have issues. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that list-like objects are handled correctly according to the expected behavior mentioned in the GitHub issue. We can simplify the logic for list-like objects to align with the behavior of array-like objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    #  com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        #  (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Correct handling for list-like objects
    return self.loc[key]
```

With this correction, the `_get_with` function should now handle list-like objects correctly and align with the expected behavior for different types of indexers, resolving the issue raised in the GitHub thread.
