### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_get_with` in the `Series` class is producing incorrect results due to mishandling different types of indexers, particularly when a list indexer is passed. The function is intended to handle various types of indexers like slices, dataframes, tuples, single values, and lists. However, the specific case of a list indexer is causing an issue.

Analyzing the buggy function:
1. The function initially checks the type of the key:
   - If it's a slice, it converts it to a positional slice.
   - If it's a DataFrame, it raises a `TypeError`.
   - If it's a tuple, it calls `_get_values_tuple`.
   - If it's not list-like, it tries to locate the key.
   - If it's not an instance of list, numpy array, ExtensionArray, Series, or Index, it coerces it into a list.
   - It infers the key type using `lib.infer_dtype` for non-integer key values.
   - Based on the key type, it chooses to locate or iloc the key or reindex it.

The issue arises when a list indexer is passed. The function incorrectly processes the list indexer, leading to incorrect key_type inference and misdirected handling based on the inferred key_type.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when a list indexer is provided. We should ensure that the key is recognized as a list and handle it accordingly without unintended coercions or misinterpretations causing key_type inconsistencies.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
        
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
        
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
        
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type in ['integer', 'floating']:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
```

By adjusting the handling of list and scalar indexers, ensuring proper coercion and inference mechanisms, and correctly determining how to locate the key based on its type, the corrected function should address the issues encountered in the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to inconsistent handling of different indexers.
