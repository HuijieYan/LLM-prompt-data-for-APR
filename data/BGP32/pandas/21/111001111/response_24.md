## Bug Fix and Explanation

The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers in Pandas Series. The function encounters issues when dealing with indexers that are lists. The expected behavior is for list indexers to be treated consistently across different indexer types.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers correctly. We should ensure that list indexers are processed in a uniform manner, similar to other indexer types like arrays or Index objects.

The key fix involves modifying the code segment that handles list indexers to align with the desired behavior described in the GitHub issue. By treating list indexers consistently, we can avoid issues such as KeyError or incorrect behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError("Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column")
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle list indexers consistently
    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By making this adjustment, we ensure that list indexers are treated uniformly like other indexer types, addressing the inconsistency and potential errors identified in the failing cases.

This revised version of the `_get_with` function should satisfy the expected input/output values for all provided test cases and align with the desired behavior outlined in the GitHub issue.
