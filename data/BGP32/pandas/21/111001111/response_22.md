The bug in the `_get_with` function lies in how it handles the key input that is not recognized as list-like or array-like. The function incorrectly tries to access the key directly as a label for location-based indexing without considering different data structures.

The key_type is determined based on the inferred data type of the key input and then the function attempts to either use `.loc` or `.iloc` based on the key_type. This logic leads to incorrect behavior when the key is not a recognized data structure for indexing.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `_get_with` function to handle different types of keys properly and prevent errors during indexing.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, np.ndarray) and key.ndim == 1:
        key = key.tolist()
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        key = key.astype('object')
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This updated version of the function handles scalar, list, numpy ndarray, and ExtensionArray keys explicitly, converting them to a suitable format for indexing with `.loc` correctly. Additionally, it falls back to `reindex` for other cases that don't match the specified conditions, ensuring a more robust and correct behavior.
