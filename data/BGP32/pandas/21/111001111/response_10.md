The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from the inconsistency in how list indexers are handled compared to other indexers in the Series class. This inconsistency leads to a KeyError when attempting to access a Series with a list indexer that has no matches.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_get_with` function to handle list indexers in a similar way to array-like indexers to maintain consistency. We can achieve this by modifying the section of the function that deals with non-array-like indexers.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (Index, Series)):
        # Handle list-like and other array-like indexers
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By updating the function to treat list indexers in a similar way to other array-like indexers, the corrected version should now properly handle all types of indexers consistently, resolving the KeyError issue highlighted in the GitHub report.
