### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the Series class in pandas. The function is intended to handle different types of indexers, such as slices, DataFrames, tuples, and scalar values, but it has a problematic section that handles the case where the key is not list-like.

When the key is not list-like, the function currently attempts to access the index using `self.loc[key]`. However, this approach may lead to incorrect behavior, as the key might not be a valid label in the index. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub bug report, indicating that the behavior is inconsistent across different types of indexers.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug and make the behavior consistent across different indexers, we need to revise the section of the function that handles non-list-like keys. Rather than directly accessing `self.loc[key]`, we should consider alternative approaches to ensure that the key is properly handled based on its type and value.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, when the key is not list-like, the function now directly calls `self.reindex(key)` to handle the situation more appropriately and consistently. This adjustment ensures that the behavior aligns with the expected outcomes across different types of indexers.
