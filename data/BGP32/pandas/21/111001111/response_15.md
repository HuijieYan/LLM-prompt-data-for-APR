The issue arises due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers (list, array-like, and Series) in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in pandas. The function is not handling the list indexers correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior when using a list indexer.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function handles list indexers in a consistent manner with other indexers and aligns with user expectations and the pandas API as described in the GitHub issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key = ensure_index(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version handles list indexers properly by first checking if the key is a scalar and then ensuring that it is converted to an Index object before determining its type and performing the appropriate indexing operation.

By making these adjustments, the `_get_with` function should now behave consistently across different types of indexers, addressing the issue described in the GitHub bug report.
