## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class in the `pandas` library. When the function receives a key that is not recognized as a list-like object, it attempts to retrieve the value using the `loc` attribute, assuming the key to be valid. However, in some cases, the key is mistakenly identified as not list-like, leading to incorrect processing and potentially raising errors.

The key issue is related to the distinction made between different types of indexers (e.g., list indexers, array-like indexers), which causes inconsistencies in behavior when accessing elements of the series. This distinction leads to unexpected behaviors, such as raising errors or returning incorrect results, as highlighted in the GitHub issue mentioned.

## Solution Strategy
To resolve the bug and address the inconsistencies reported in the GitHub issue, the `_get_with` function needs to accurately identify the type of the key provided and handle each type appropriately. Additionally, to ensure consistency and correct behavior across different types of indexers, the function should be modified to treat all indexers consistently, similar to how list indexers are currently handled.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        key = list(key)
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that all types of indexers are treated consistently, improving the handling of different key types and resolving the bugs and inconsistencies identified in the failing test cases and reported GitHub issue.
