The bug in the `_get_with` function arises due to the incorrect handling of indexers, specifically when a list-like key is provided. The function doesn't cover the case where the key is a list, which leads to incorrect behavior and potential errors. To fix this bug, we need to update the logic to handle list-like keys properly.

The issue arises due to inconsistent behavior between list indexers and other types of indexers within the pandas library, as highlighted in the GitHub issue.

To correct the bug and align with the expected input/output values, we need to modify the `_get_with` function as follows:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label-based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Handle the case where the key is a list
    if isinstance(key, list):
        # handle the dup indexing case GH#4246
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Note: The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
    # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

By adding a specific check for list-like keys and handling them appropriately using `self.loc[key]`, we ensure that the function behaves consistently with other types of indexers as expected. This correction addresses the issue presented in the failing test cases and aligns with the expected input/output values.
