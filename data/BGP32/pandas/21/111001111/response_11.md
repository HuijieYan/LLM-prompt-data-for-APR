The bug in the `_get_with` function arises from incorrectly identifying the type of the key during indexing. When the key is not recognized as list-like or an array-like type, the function wrongly falls back to treating it as a single scalar value for indexing, leading to incorrect behavior.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the logic for identifying the type of the key and handling the indexing appropriately. We should first check if the key is index-like or array-like and use the appropriate method for indexing based on the type.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, Index)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Index is not supported, use the appropriate column of DataFrame."
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Check for array-like indexers
    if is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, ExtensionArray):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # Fallback to reindex for other cases
        return self.reindex(key)
```

By explicitly checking for array-like indexers after slice and tuple cases and before single scalar cases, we ensure that the function correctly handles various types of indexing. This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the provided test cases and addresses the issue reported on GitHub.
