The issue arises from the different treatment of list indexers compared to array-like indexers in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function does not handle list indexers correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and raising errors in certain cases.

The bug occurs when dealing with list indexers, where the function should treat them similarly to array-like indexers, but it fails to do so. This results in incorrect handling and leads to the raised error.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic for handling list indexers to align with the behavior for array-like indexers. By treating list indexers the same way as array-like indexers, we can achieve consistent behavior and avoid errors that currently occur.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    if not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
        
    if key.inferred_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    return self.loc[key]
```

This updated version checks for list-like objects and `Series` objects separately to handle them correctly. Additionally, `ensure_index` is used to ensure that the key is transformed into an appropriate index type before further processing. The modified logic should now provide consistent behavior for different types of indexers, resolving the bug.
