The issue in the `_get_with` function arises from the handling of different types of indexers, specifically when a list indexer is used. The function attempts to process the key variable based on its type, and there are discrepancies in handling list-like objects compared to other indexers which caused unexpected behavior.

The key issue stems from the fact that when a list-like object is passed as the key, the function does not handle it appropriately in terms of conversion and processing. This discrepancy leads to inconsistency in functionality compared to other indexers, affecting the return values and ultimately causing failures.

To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the function handles list-like objects correctly, aligning the processing method with other indexers to maintain consistency and avoid unexpected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    elif not is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, np.ndarray):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = ensure_index(key)
    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

With this corrected version, the function now properly handles list-like objects as input key values, ensuring consistent behavior with other indexers and correctly processing the key for return values according to the expected logic. These changes aim to resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue and provide more robust functionality for the `_get_with` function.
