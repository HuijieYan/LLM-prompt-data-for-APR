### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check the value of the `make_current` parameter and then call the `make_current` method accordingly. However, the bug lies in the conditional check when `make_current` is set to `True`. The current code checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.


### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check for the case when `make_current` is `True`. The check should now ensure that no `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make the current instance.


### Corrected code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the buggy function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` by checking for the absence of an `IOLoop` instance.
