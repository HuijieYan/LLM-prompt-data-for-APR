### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, it incorrectly tries to set the current `IOLoop` instance again.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation of the `initialize` function is in the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, it still tries to set the current instance.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, we should raise a `RuntimeError` immediately.

### Corrected code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
