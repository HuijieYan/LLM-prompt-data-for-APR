### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check the value of the `make_current` parameter and either make the current `IOLoop` or raise an error if a current instance already exists. The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. 

### Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in this case, which is not the intended behavior.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary `if` condition that raises the `RuntimeError` and simply call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True`. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
