### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the condition where `make_current` is `True`.

The buggy code checks if `make_current` is `True` and then verifies if the current instance of the `IOLoop` is `None`, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and raise an error if one already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition when `make_current` is `True` to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if one already exists.

### Corrected Function
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
