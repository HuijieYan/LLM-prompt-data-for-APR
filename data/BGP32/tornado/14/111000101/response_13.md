### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is expected to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there is a bug in the conditional checks that determine whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the conditional statement `if make_current is None`. In this condition, if `make_current` is `False`, the code will enter the `if` block and attempt to set the current instance instead of falling back to the `else` block. This will lead to incorrect behavior.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to change the conditional statement to explicitly check for `make_current` as `False` before setting the current instance. We will modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle all cases.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
