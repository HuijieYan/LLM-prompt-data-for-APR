### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The `current` method is used to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and the `make_current` method is used to set the current instance.
- The bug occurs in the logic where if `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current instance if one does not already exist, otherwise raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function's logic. When `make_current` is `True`, it is checking if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then trying to set it, but it should actually raise a `RuntimeError` if there is no current instance.

### Fix:
Adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
