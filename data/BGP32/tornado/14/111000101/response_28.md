### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there are some issues in the implementation of the function.

### Error Location
The bug occurs in the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function where the behavior is not as expected.

### Bug Explanation
- When `make_current` is `True`, the function is supposed to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does not exist, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
- If `make_current` is `None`, the function should make the current `IOLoop` instance only if no instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `True`, `False`, or `None`.

### Corrected Code
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation
- I have added a new variable `current_instance` to store the current instance of `IOLoop`.
- In the `if` block, if `make_current` is `None`, we check if `current_instance` is `None`. If it is, we call `self.make_current()`.
- In the `elif` block, if `make_current` is `True`, we check if `current_instance` is not `None`. If it is not `None`, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we call `self.make_current()`.
