### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance and making it the current instance if `make_current` parameter is True.
2. The bug seems to be in the condition where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and tries to make the current instance, but it only does so when `make_current` is `None`.
3. The bug occurs because the code inside the `initialize` function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly.

### Bug
The bug is in the following section of code:
```python
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```
When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current instance exists, and if not, it raises an error. However, it should not attempt to make the current instance in this block because that should have been done in the previous block.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Remove the `self.make_current()` call from the `elif` block when `make_current` is `True`.
2. Modify the condition in the `elif` block to simply raise an error if a current instance does not exist when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
```
