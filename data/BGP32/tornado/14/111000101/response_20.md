### Bugs in the buggy function:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is checking if `make_current` is None, which would trigger `self.make_current()`. Instead, it should check if `make_current is True` to handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.

2. In the `elif make_current` block, there is a redundant check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is unnecessary since this was already checked in the previous block. This check should be removed.

### Strategy to fix the bugs:
1. Change the condition `if make_current is None` to `if make_current is True`.
2. Remove the unnecessary check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` from the `elif make_current` block.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
