### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The buggy code checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if there is.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic where it should set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True.
5. The `current` function is expected to return the current `IOLoop` instance or None if none exists.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `initialize` function where it fails to set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True.

### Corrected code:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
