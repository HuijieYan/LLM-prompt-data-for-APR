### Analysis
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object.
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is `None`. In this case, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function is called to check if there is a current instance of IOLoop. If not, then `self.make_current()` is called to set the current instance.
- The bug is in the logic when `make_current` is `None`. The `if` condition should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, not if it is not `None`.
- It seems that the intention is to make the current loop the instance if no loop exists currently.


### Bug Fix Strategy
- Change the condition in the first `if` statement to properly check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
- Update the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and no current instance of IOLoop exists.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
```
