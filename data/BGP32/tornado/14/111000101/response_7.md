### Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with an optional parameter `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using the `current` function and if not, it should call `make_current` to make itself the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should also check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if so, or call `make_current` to become the current `IOLoop`.

The bug in the current implementation arises from the condition `if make_current is None:` which checks the value of `make_current` directly. The correct approach should be to compare the value with `None` using `==` operator instead of `is`. Additionally, the condition `if make_current:` should be changed to handle both `True` and `False` values of `make_current` appropriately.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the comparison `if make_current is None:` to `if make_current == None:`.
2. Change the condition `if make_current:` to check if `make_current` is `True`.
3. Update the conditions to handle the case when `make_current` is `False` if needed.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current == None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) == None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current == True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) != None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
