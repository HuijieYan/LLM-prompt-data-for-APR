### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks whether an IOLoop instance exists and makes it the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter provided.
2. There is a bug in the logic where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and sets it to be current.
3. The bug appears to be in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of the current instance and sets it.
   
### Bug Explanation
The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly handle the case where `make_current=True`. It checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it raises an error immediately instead of making the current instance the existing one. This prevents the correct setting of the current IOLoop.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. Instead of raising an error if the current instance is None, we need to set the instance as the current one.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if existing_instance is not None:
                existing_instance.make_current()
            else:
                self.make_current()
```
