### Explanation of the bug

The bug in the `initialize` function occurs when `make_current` is set to `None` or `True`. The function is supposed to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance or not, and if not, make the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug arises because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance or not, but this condition will always be `True` even if there is a current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to update the logic inside the `if` conditions where we check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. We should handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True` appropriately to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

### Code Fix

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before making it the current instance, we ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the `make_current` parameter provided.
