### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` object by setting it as the current instance if necessary. The function checks the `make_current` parameter, and if it is `True`, it ensures that no current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting itself as the current one.

### Issues
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the instantiation of `IOLoop` could return an instance without calling `make_current`. This can lead to a false error state.
2. The if-else structure is not correctly handling the logic of setting the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the conditions to check and set the current `IOLoop` instance. The check for whether an instance exists is not properly linked to the `make_current` parameter.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance to directly check if it is the same instance as the one being initialized.
2. Adjust the conditions within the function to correctly handle setting the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter value.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
                self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, the function now properly checks if the current instance is not the same as the one being initialized before setting it as the current instance if needed. The logic for handling setting the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter has also been simplified and fixed.
