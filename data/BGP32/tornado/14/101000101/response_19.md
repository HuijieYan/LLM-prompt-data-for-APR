### Analysis
In the buggy function `initialize`, the conditional logic is jumbled and the use of the `IOLoop.current` method is incorrect. The bug occurs when checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect usage of the `current` method from the `IOLoop` class. The `current` method is a class method and should be called directly on the class `IOLoop`, not on an instance of `IOLoop`.
- The code incorrectly calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of `IOLoop.current()`.
- Also, the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is not correctly implemented, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Correct the usage of the `IOLoop.current` method by directly calling it on the class `IOLoop`.
- Adjust the conditional logic to properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version addresses the bug by fixing the method call to `IOLoop.current()` and adjusting the conditional logic to correctly check for the current `IOLoop` instance.
