### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to set the current IOLoop or raise an error if it already exists. The issue seems to be related to how the `make_current` parameter is handled and how the `current` function is called.

### Bug Explanation
1. The `make_current` parameter is checked for `None`, but the condition for calling `self.make_current()` is only executed if `make_current` is `None`. This means that the current IOLoop might not be set correctly if `make_current` is `True`.
2. The use of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the conditions seems to be incorrect as the `current` function is not a static method and should be called on an instance of `IOLoop`.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, the `initialize` function should raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists, but the condition for that check seems ambiguous.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Change the condition for checking `make_current` to set the current IOLoop correctly.
2. Call the `current` function on the instance of `IOLoop` inside the `initialize` function.
3. Clarify the condition for raising an error if the current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(self):
        # method logic here

    def make_current(self):
        # method logic here

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
