### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional statement that checks the value of `make_current` and calls the `make_current` method if necessary. However, the bug occurs in the condition where `make_current` is `True` because it does not correctly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Explanation
- If `make_current` is `True`, the buggy function checks if an IOLoop instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. 
- If an instance does not exist, the `make_current` method is called.
- However, if an instance already exists, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` according to the expected behavior. But the current implementation does not handle this case and proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for `make_current` being `True` to correctly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists. If an instance already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError` immediately.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
  
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
