### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to check if an IOLoop instance exists and if not, create a new one. However, there are issues in the logic of the function that need to be addressed.

### Bugs
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` should be checked before the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. If `make_current` is None, we should proceed to create a new IOLoop instance.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` should be used instead of `elif make_current`. This will ensure that the block of code inside this condition is executed only when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix
1. Swap the order of the two `if` conditions in the `initialize` function.
2. Change `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current is True:` for clearer boolean comparison.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
