The buggy function `initialize` checks the `make_current` parameter, and if it is `None`, it calls `IOLoop.current()` with the `instance=False` parameter to check if the current IOLoop instance exists. If it does not exist, it calls `self.make_current()` to create a new instance. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks the current instance again and if it exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`, otherwise it calls `self.make_current()`.

The bug in the current implementation is that the condition `elif make_current:` is not checking for `False` values. This means that even if `make_current` is `False`, the code inside the `elif` block will still be executed. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the function may try to create a new instance even when `make_current` is set to `False`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition to explicitly check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is `False`, we should not create a new instance and only raise an error if an instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that the function behaves as expected and only creates a new instance when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
