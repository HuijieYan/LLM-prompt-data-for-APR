### Analysis and Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is checking the value of the `make_current` parameter and then calling the `IOLoop.current` and `make_current` functions based on the condition. However, there is a bug in the logic of the `initialize` function where it is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is True.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is True, and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of setting the current IOLoop, which results in the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should set the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # Current IOLoop already exists, set it as current
                self.make_current()
            else:
                # Current IOLoop does not exist, create new
                self.make_current()
```

This corrected version will handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists by setting the current IOLoop instead of raising a `RuntimeError`.
