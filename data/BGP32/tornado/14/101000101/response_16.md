The buggy function `initialize` is designed to check the existence of the current instance of the `IOLoop` class and either create a new one or raise an error based on the `make_current` parameter. 

The bug in the code lies in the condition `elif make_current:` where it should actually be `if make_current:` because the intention is to check whether `make_current` is `True`. Due to this bug, the function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the condition `elif make_current:` to `if make_current:`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the function should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and address the bug mentioned above.
