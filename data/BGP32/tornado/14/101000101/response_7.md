### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`. If `make_current` is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is provided as `True`, the function should also call `self.make_current()`. Currently, the code inside the `elif make_current:` block is redundant and does not achieve the intended behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant `self.make_current()` call inside the `elif make_current:` block and ensure that `self.make_current()` is called whenever `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
