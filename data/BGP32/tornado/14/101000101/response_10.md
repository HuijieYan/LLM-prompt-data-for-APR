### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize()` is intended to check and set the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there is an issue in the logic that checks if an IOLoop already exists. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and it tries to make the current IOLoop without properly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Explanation
When `make_current` is set to `True`, the buggy function should first check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to set a new one. However, the current logic fails to account for this, resulting in the RuntimeError always being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when `make_current` is set to `True`. We should first check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and only set the current IOLoop if none exists. If an IOLoop instance already exists, we should not raise an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
            pass
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic as shown above, the corrected function will properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before setting the current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True`.
