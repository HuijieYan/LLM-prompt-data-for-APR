### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop instance. The issue lies in the condition check for `make_current`. The current logic is checking for `make_current` being `True`, but it should be checking for `make_current` being `None` to satisfy the expected behavior.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by incorrect condition checking in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop only if one doesn't already exist. However, the current implementation is raising an error if the current IOLoop exists, which is not expected behavior.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the condition checking should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. The condition should check for `make_current` being `None` to ensure that the IOLoop is set only if it doesn't already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Adjusted condition check
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and satisfies the expected input/output values.
