### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` takes a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean value. Depending on the value of `make_current`, it should either make the current IOLoop instance or raise a RuntimeError if an instance already exists. The bug seems to be in the if-else conditions inside the function.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when checking the value of `make_current`. The condition `if make_current is None` should actually be checking `if not make_current is None` to handle both cases of `None` and `False` properly. Additionally, the condition `if make_current` should only make the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True`, not if it has any truthy value.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the if-else conditions to properly check for the two cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. We can make use of `is None` and `is True` for explicit comparison.

### Corrected code
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
