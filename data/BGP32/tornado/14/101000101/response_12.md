### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class seems to have an issue related to the condition for checking the current `IOLoop` instance. The function is supposed to optionally set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` parameter is passed as `True`. The bug lies in the condition check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is used to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, this condition does not properly handle the case where an instance exists but `None` is not returned. This can lead to incorrect decisions being made in setting the current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition used to check for the current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of just checking if it is `None`, we should check if an instance actually exists. Additionally, we should modify the condition flow to handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` as well.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Yet to be implemented

    def make_current(self):
        # Yet to be implemented

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
