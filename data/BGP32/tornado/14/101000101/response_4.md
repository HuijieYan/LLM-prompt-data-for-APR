### Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method of the class. If `make_current` is not `None` and is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing. If it does not exist, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug
The bug in the original function lies in the condition where `make_current` is `True`. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before making the current instance, which leads to an incorrect check. The condition should be checking if the current instance is `not None` instead.

### Fix
To fix the bug in the function, we need to correct the condition when `make_current` is `True` to check if the current instance is `not None`. This will ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised only if there is an existing instance.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
