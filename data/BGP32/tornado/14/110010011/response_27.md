### Error Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is `True`, and then checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. The failing test is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which triggers the condition where it checks if the current instance is `None`.
3. The issue seems to be with the logic of the `initialize` function where it raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` when it checks for `make_current`. This logic is likely causing the issue mentioned in the GitHub issue where it raises an error even if the current `IOLoop` is not present.
4. To fix this issue, we need to revise the logic of the `initialize()` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.


### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. We need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.
2. The function should only try to make the current instance if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance already present.
3. We should remove the check for the current instance being `None` when `make_current=True` to resolve the issue raised in the failing test and GitHub issue.


### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            # Removed the condition above to raise an error
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize()` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed. It now correctly checks if the current instance already exists before trying to make it the current instance when `make_current=True`.
