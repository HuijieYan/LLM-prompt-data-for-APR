### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` "current IOLoop already exists" is raised when `make_current` is set to `True`, even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`.
- The GitHub issue suggests that there is a discrepancy in the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None` but still raises an error.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The issue seems to be in the condition where it checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current.
- The logic that raises the `RuntimeError` needs to be reevaluated.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance. The logic mistakenly raises an error even when `IOLoop.current` returns `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the error is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it should not raise the `"current IOLoop already exists"` error.

### Corrected Version of the Code:

```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # change from is None to is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. This correction should resolve the issue and the corresponding failing test.
