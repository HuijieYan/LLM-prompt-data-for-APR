### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and then tries to make the current instance if `make_current` is not specified.
2. The failing test is trying to force the current `IOLoop` instance which is already existing, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and thus the attempt to make it current again raises the `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug is due to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it is trying to make the `IOLoop` instance current even if it already exists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to directly return if the current instance is already existing without trying to make it current again.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:  # Check if trying to force make current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None:  # If make_current is not specified
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current instance does not exist
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrections made to the logic of the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass without raising any `RuntimeError`.
