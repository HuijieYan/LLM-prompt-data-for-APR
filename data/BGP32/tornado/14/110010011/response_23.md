### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and then based on the `make_current` parameter, either sets the current `IOLoop` or raises an error if one is already set.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error is occurring when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.
   
3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The `initialize` function has a conditional check for `make_current`, and if it is `True`, then it tries to set the current instance of `IOLoop`.
   - The bug occurs because even though the function checks if an `IOLoop` instance exists before setting it as current, it raises an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, contradicting the logic.
   - The error message indicates that a current `IOLoop` already exists, but the code proceeds to raise an error for the same condition.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance already set.
   - Modify the conditional checks to ensure that the desired behavior is achieved: setting as current if required, and throwing an error only when appropriate.
   
5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable to avoid redundant calls.
- Adjust the conditional checks to ensure that the error is only raised when trying to set a current instance when one already exists and `make_current` is `True`.
