### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This function checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists and attempts to make itself the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The function is causing a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This is contradictory to the intended behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic so that if `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, we should not raise an error. Instead, we should either silently ignore the `make_current` command or handle it in a different way.
5. Given this analysis, the bug can be fixed by adjusting the conditional logic in the `initialize` function.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # Do nothing or handle differently based on the requirements
            pass
```

By modifying the logic in the `initialize` function, we address the issue highlighted in the failing test and GitHub report. This corrected version ensures that when `make_current=True`, if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it won't raise an error but instead handles the situation appropriately.
