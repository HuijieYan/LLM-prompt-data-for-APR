### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, specifically dealing with setting it as the current IOLoop.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised, stating that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The bug occurs due to misinterpretation of the logic in the `initialize` function. The intention behind this code seems to be that if the `make_current` argument is `True`, then it should check if the current IOLoop exists and raise an error if it does not exist.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to provide the correct check if the IOLoop exists before trying to make it the current IOLoop. If it does not exist, then raise the `RuntimeError`.
5. By updating the logic in the function, we can fix the bug. 

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic has been updated to properly check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it the current one. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current IOLoop actually exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
