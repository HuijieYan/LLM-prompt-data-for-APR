### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current instance, it raises a RuntimeError, which is contradictory.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` but fails because there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.
- The corresponding error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- The GitHub issue suggests that there is a contradiction in the logic on line 252 (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) leading to the RuntimeError being raised.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the logic that checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the conflicting logic in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should not raise a RuntimeError. However, the existing logic raises a RuntimeError in this scenario.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should only make the new `IOLoop` instance current if it does not already exist.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                return  # Skip making it current if already exists
            self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment to the `initialize` function, the corrected version should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This modification should resolve the bug and prevent the RuntimeError from being raised in that scenario.
