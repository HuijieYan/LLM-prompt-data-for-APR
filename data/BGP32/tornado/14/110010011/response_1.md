### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is checking if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, and if so, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` or not. If it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message `"current IOLoop already exists"`.
   
2. The error message from the failing test shows that when trying to force the current IOLoop to be the existing instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` because the current instance is already set.

3. The `initialize` function is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance if certain conditions are met. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is `True`, but the current IOLoop instance is already set. This leads to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

4. To fix the bug, we need to check if the `make_current` argument is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before setting it as the current instance. If the current instance already exists in this case, we should simply return without raising an error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the conditional check for the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` but the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    ... (previous docs) ...
    """
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current IOLoop instance exists
                return  # Return without setting the new instance as current
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will first check if the current instance is already set when `make_current` is `True`, and only set the new instance as current if the current instance is `None`. This modification should resolve the issue identified on GitHub and allow the tests to pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
