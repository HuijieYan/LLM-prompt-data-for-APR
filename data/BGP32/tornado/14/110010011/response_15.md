#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the logic to make the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, tries to set the current instance.
2. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists, but it is currently raising the error in both cases.
4. To fix the bug, the condition that checks for a current `IOLoop` instance should be adjusted to only raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

#### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By adjusting the condition in the `initialize` function as shown in the corrected version above, the bug should be fixed, and the `RuntimeError` will only be raised when necessary.
