1. The buggy function is part of the `IOLoop` class defined in the `tornado.ioloop` module. The function is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current `IOLoop` if required.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are where the `make_current` argument is checked:

- In the first `if` statement: `if make_current is None:`
- In the second `if` statement inside the `elif` branch: `elif make_current:`

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before making the current instance the new one. However, the logic is flawed, as it should instead raise an error only if there is no current instance already.

The error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is a consequence of this flawed logic. The GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None" points out the inconsistency in the code logic and questions why the error is raised in this scenario.

4. To fix the bug, the function should first check if `make_current` is `True`, and then only raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `False` or `None`, the function should proceed to make the current instance as required.

5. Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the function now correctly checks the condition to raise an error only when trying to force a current `IOLoop` and there is already an existing current instance. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue identified in the GitHub thread.
