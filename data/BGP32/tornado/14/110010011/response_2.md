### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to determine whether to make the current instance or raise an error. The issue seems to arise from the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised.
- The error message points to the line in the `initialize` function where the error is triggered.

### Identified potential error:
- The logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is incorrect in both conditions.

### Cause of the bug:
- The buggy function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The logic intended is to raise an error when `make_current=True` and the current instance is not `None`.
- In the failing test, the error is triggered because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the code does not check for this condition properly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- Update the conditions to accurately check whether to make the current instance or raise an error.

### Bug-fixed version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists before making current
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current=True`, the bug is fixed to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make it current.
