### Analysis:
1. Buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is a method of the `IOLoop` class.
2. The error occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to True and the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is causing a RuntimeError to be raised erroneously when `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The buggy function incorrectly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error even when it's expected to allow the current instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the function to only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and a current instance doesn't exist.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: changed 'is None' to 'is not None'
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and a current instance of `IOLoop` exists.
