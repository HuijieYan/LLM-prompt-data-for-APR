### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `initialize()` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
- The error occurs when the `initialize()` function is called with `make_current=True`.
- The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists".
- The issue on GitHub highlights a discrepancy at line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None`, leading to confusion about why the error is raised.

### Identify potential error locations:
1. The conditional checks within the `initialize()` function, specifically where exceptions are raised.
2. The logic related to making the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Explanation of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the `initialize()` function is faulty. When `make_current=True`, it is expected that the `IOLoop` should already exist. However, the check for `None` at `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is causing the confusion, leading to an incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

### Suggested Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize()` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` correctly.
- Ensure that when `make_current=True`, the `IOLoop` instance is correctly initialized and verified before making it current.

### Corrected Version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have changed the conditional check in the `initialize()` function for `make_current=True`. The logic now checks if the current `IOLoop` is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`. This change will align the behavior with the expected scenario where the current `IOLoop` should exist when `make_current=True`.
