### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is `True` and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is one, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The issue seems to be related to the condition checking logic.
   
2. The error is occurring in a test case where the `make_current` argument is set to `True` and the `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the `initialize` function is still raising a `RuntimeError`.

3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect condition logic inside the `initialize` function. The check for `make_current` should only raise an error if it is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. The current logic raises an error after successfully setting the current `IOLoop`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check to only raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Updated/corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Additional check for already existing IOLoop
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:  # Adjusted condition
            self.make_current()
```

By adding an additional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This will fix the bug and pass the failing test case.
