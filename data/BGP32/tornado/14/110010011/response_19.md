### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is `True`, and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code is raising a `RuntimeError` even if the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance being `None` passes.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic to check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. Due to this incorrect logic, even when `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing `IOLoop` instance, it is still raising a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly check for the presence of an existing `IOLoop` instance and handle the case where `make_current` is `True` without any existing instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition to check if `make_current` is `True` first, and then verify if an existing `IOLoop` instance is present.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing instance, make the current `IOLoop`.
3. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing instance, do not raise an error and proceed.
4. In case `make_current` is not provided or is `None`, follow the existing logic to handle making the current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                return
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above adjustments to the logic in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should handle the scenario correctly where `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing `IOLoop` instance.
