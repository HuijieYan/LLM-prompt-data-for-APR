### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if it does not, it makes the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Error location:
- The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It should raise an error only if `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists. However, the current implementation is raising the error even if a `IOLoop` instance is already present when `make_current` is `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function:
1. If `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, the function should not raise an error.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists, then make the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is `False`, do nothing and leave the existing state as is.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other code
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()  # Make the current instance
            # No error is raised, even if a current instance exists when make_current is True
```

By making the above changes, the fixed version of the `initialize` function will handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists without raising an error.
