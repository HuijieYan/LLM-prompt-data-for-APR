### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
- The main issue is checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The error message indicates that the code is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when the `make_current` argument is `True`.
- The GitHub issue points out the confusion in the logic at line 252, where it checks if the current instance is `None`.

### Error Location:
- The issue is in the conditional statements within the `initialize` function. 
- Specifically, checking for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and raising an error message regardless of the `make_current` value.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is performed incorrectly.
- The code raises a `RuntimeError` if the current instance is `None`, but it should only raise the error if `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- We need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
- We should raise the `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix the condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will accurately handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and prevent the unnecessary `RuntimeError`.
