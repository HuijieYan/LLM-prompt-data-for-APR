### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is None and then if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

2. The failing test is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, which triggers the `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` instance is actually None at that moment.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked twice, leading to the `RuntimeError` despite the condition being true.

4. To fix the bug, we should remove the second check of `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is True, as we have already checked it when `make_current` is None.

### Bug Fix:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            # Removed the second check for IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By removing the duplicate check and raising the `RuntimeError` directly when `make_current=True`, we prevent the error from occurring when initializing an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`. This fix aligns the behavior with the intended logic of the `initialize` function.
