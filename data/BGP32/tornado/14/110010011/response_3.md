### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance with an optional argument `make_current` which determines whether the instance should become the current IOLoop or not.
- The error message indicates that when `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, a `RuntimeError` is being raised even though it should not.
- The GitHub issue also points out the discrepancy in the logic at line 252, where the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` seems to be contradicting the subsequent error message.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `make_current` with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is evaluated incorrectly.
2. The logic in the `initialize` function for handling the `make_current` argument might be causing the issue.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect evaluation of the condition for `make_current`. Since the logic should only raise an error if a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is True, the condition `if make_current:` needs to be adjusted to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before raising an error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition logic with the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, the corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance exists and `make_current` is True.
