### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current `IOLoop` exists and then either sets the current `IOLoop` or raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` even though `make_current` is `True`.
- The GitHub issue points out the confusion in this behavior and questions why the error is being raised in this case.

### Error Location:
- The error is likely occurring in the `initialize` function when checking for the current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists before raising the error. However, in this context, when `make_current=True`, the intent should be to force setting the current `IOLoop` even if one already exists. So, the error message saying "current IOLoop already exists" is contradictory in this case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The `if` condition when `make_current=True` should bypass the check for an existing current instance and simply call `self.make_current()` unconditionally.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:  # Added `make_current` as part of the condition
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the function above, the explicit check for an existing current instance of `IOLoop` is removed when `make_current=True`. This change ensures that the current `IOLoop` is set regardless of whether one already exists, resolving the bug and aligning the behavior with the intended functionality.
