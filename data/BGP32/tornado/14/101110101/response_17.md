## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` object with the option to make it the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The buggy function fails in the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The failing test case expects that when a new `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, it should become the current instance. It also expects that trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The buggy code does not properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Bug and Solution
The bug occurs because the code does not check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one when `make_current=True`. The `IOLoop.current` function is incorrectly called with `instance=False`, which causes the check to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the `current_instance` check correctly without setting `instance=False`, the corrected code should now handle the scenario described in the failing test.
