The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance incorrectly, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the function `initialize` incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` even if there is no current IOLoop instance. This is due to the incorrect logic in checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The buggy function compares the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `None`, which is not a correct way to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. We can achieve this by checking if the attribute `self._current_instance` is set. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self._current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self._current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes and correctly checking `self._current_instance`, the function will now correctly handle the creation of a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
