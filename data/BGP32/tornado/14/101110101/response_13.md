Based on the provided information, the bug in the `initialize` function is causing a RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter. The bug occurs because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is not being handled correctly.

### Bug Explanation:
- The `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`.
- Inside the function, there is a check to see if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is True.
- If an `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised, but this is incorrect behavior for this case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The bug can be fixed by restructuring the logic inside the `initialize` function.
- Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`, we can modify the logic to only set the current `IOLoop` when it does not exist.
- If an `IOLoop` instance already exists, we can skip setting the current instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Skip setting the current instance if it already exists
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should allow the failing test case to pass.
