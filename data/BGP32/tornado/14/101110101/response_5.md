The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then creates one, but it should also check if there is already a current IOLoop instance existing before trying to create a new one.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function doesn't check if a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly when trying to create a new current IOLoop instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before trying to create a new one when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will first check if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
