## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by setting the current loop. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current loop already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects the instance to become the current loop. It then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the second `IOLoop` construction with `make_current=True` is not raising the `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug seems to be in the condition where it checks if a current loop already exists. This check is not handling the case where a loop is already made current.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where it checks if a loop is already current.

## Bug Fix
I have corrected the buggy function by modifying the condition where it checks if a loop is already current.

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Changed the condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function should work correctly and pass the failing test.
