## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is `True`, and if so, it tries to ensure only one current `IOLoop` instance exists. However, the logic inside the `initialize` function is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`. This behavior is incorrect based on the failing test scenario.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the condition check inside the `initialize` function. The condition `elif make_current` should only raise an error if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Instead, it is raising an error irrespective of whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. This leads to incorrect behavior.

## Fix Strategy
The condition should be adjusted to first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before raising an error. If the current `IOLoop` instance is already present, the function should skip the `make_current` call and proceed without raising an error.

## Code Correction
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition inside the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, resolving the bug and passing the failing test.
