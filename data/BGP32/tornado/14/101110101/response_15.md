### Analysis

1. **Bug:** The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly. It should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True` before making the current IOLoop instance.
   
2. **Reason:** The bug is causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when `make_current` is `True` because it is not properly checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. This leads to an incorrect behavior when trying to force the current IOLoop instance.

### Fix

To fix this bug, we can modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We need to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance.

### Corrected Version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction adds a check to ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, it only makes the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't already exist. This will prevent the RuntimeError from being raised in the case where the current IOLoop instance is already set.
