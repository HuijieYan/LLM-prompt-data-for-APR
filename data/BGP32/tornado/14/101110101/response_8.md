The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance before creating a new one with the `make_current=True` parameter. This check is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised when it shouldn't.

The buggy function logic can be modified as follows:

1. Only check for an existing IOLoop instance if `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, simply return without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will no longer raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True` is provided as a parameter.
