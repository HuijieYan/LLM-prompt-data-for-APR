## Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue when checking the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an IOLoop already exists and raises an exception if it does.
- The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` which should fail.
- The error message indicates that the second creation of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` is not properly failing as expected. It shows that the RuntimeError is being raised by the check if an IOLoop already exists.

## Bug
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when checking if an IOLoop already exists. The check should only happen when `make_current` is `True`. However, in the current implementation, the check is always performed, leading to the RuntimeError being raised even when it shouldn't.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check for an existing IOLoop instance only happens when `make_current` is `True`. We can achieve this by moving the check inside the `elif make_current:` block.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and behave as expected.
