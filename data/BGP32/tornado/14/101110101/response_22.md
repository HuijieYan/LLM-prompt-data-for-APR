## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before raising an error, which is causing the test to fail.
2. In the failing test, `test_force_current`, the test tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised if another `IOLoop` instance is attempted to be created with `make_current=True`.
3. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. We should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After fixing the bug with the corrected function above, the failing test should pass successfully.
