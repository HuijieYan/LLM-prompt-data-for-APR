The bug in the provided function is that the `initialize` function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. The function should instead check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.

Please note that the actual implementation details of `make_current` and other methods within the class are not provided here as they are not relevant to solving the bug in the `initialize` function.
