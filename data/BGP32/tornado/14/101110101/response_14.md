The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it is raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, even if no current `IOLoop` exists. This is causing the test function `test_force_current` to fail.

To fix this bug, we should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If no current `IOLoop` instance exists, then we should proceed to make the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This modification ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is `True`.

With this corrected version, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass, and the expected input/output values will be satisfied.
