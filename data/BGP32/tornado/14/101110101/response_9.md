## Analysis
1. The buggy function, `initialize`, is intended to initialize the IOLoop object.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, setting the current IOLoop object.
3. The failing test expects that the current IOLoop object is already set and raising a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` is called again.
4. The bug occurs when checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The logic is incorrect regarding when to raise the `RuntimeError`.

## Bug
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when checking if the current IOLoop object already exists. The current logic does not handle the case where `make_current=True` even if the current IOLoop object is already set, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

## Fix
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop object is already set. The correct approach is to only set the current IOLoop object if it is not already set, regardless of the value of `make_current`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions in the class
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        # Check if the current IOLoop is not already set
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop object is already set.
