## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of an instance of the class and ensuring that the current `IOLoop` is set correctly.
2. The issue in the buggy function arises when attempting to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` which is flawed.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is designed to test the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists when trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Bug Fix
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, we ensure that a new `IOLoop` instance is only created if the current one doesn't exist. This fix addresses the issue identified in the failing test.

After applying this fix, the corrected `initialize` function should now pass the failing test by correctly handling the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
