## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True`, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised even when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The issue lies in the conditional check for `make_current` when it is `True`, which raises an error regardless of the current state of the `IOLoop`.
3. To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check for `make_current` so that it only raises an error when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.
4. By making this adjustment, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

## Proposed Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By adding an additional check to ensure that `make_current=True` only raises an error when an `IOLoop` instance already exists, we can resolve the bug in the `initialize` function.
