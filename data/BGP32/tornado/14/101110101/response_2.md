The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test because when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` but it is not handling the case where an instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. We should check if an instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test case. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
