The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make the current IOLoop.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the failing test, `test_force_current`, the IOLoop is initialized with `make_current=True`.
2. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class first checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is, it proceeds to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before making the current IOLoop.
3. In the failing test case, since `make_current` is `True`, the call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns an existing IOLoop instance, causing the function to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` without checking if an IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # possible values are True or False
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `make_current` method will always be called when `make_current` is `True`, regardless of the current existence of an IOLoop instance. This will ensure that the failing test case is handled correctly and the expected behavior is achieved.
