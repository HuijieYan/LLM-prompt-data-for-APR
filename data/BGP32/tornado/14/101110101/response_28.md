## Correction:

The bug in the `initialize` function is that it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` is passed, but it doesn't check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before making it the current one. This causes the test to fail because it tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when one already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if an `IOLoop` instance is already the current one before trying to make it the current one again.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

        # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding a check for the current `IOLoop` instance before making it the current one, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
