### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This logic seems contradictory as "already exists" implies that an `IOLoop` instance is present.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion regarding the condition check at line 252 - `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. There seems to be a misunderstanding of the logic leading to the raising of the error message.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from a misunderstanding of the logic in the `initialize` function. The condition check for `make_current=None` followed by the condition check for `make_current=True` is ambiguous. The logic assumes that if an `IOLoop` instance is not None, it should raise an error, but it erroneously checks for `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the presence of an `IOLoop` instance needs to be clarified. Since `make_current` parameter is either `None` or `True`, we can simplify the logic by directly checking the conditions and raising the error if the `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Code Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the `initialize` function resolves the ambiguity in the logic and ensures that the error is only raised when an `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` parameter is explicitly set to `True`.
