## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is trying to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is already existing or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that there's a problem in the logic of the `initialize` function where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` instance is set to `None`.
3. The bug occurs because of the incorrect logic flow in the `initialize` function that does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
4. The fix for the bug involves properly validating the conditions and responding accordingly to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current` is None, then check the current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. If `make_current` is `None` and the current instance is `None`, then set the current instance using `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is not `None` and the current instance is not `None`, throw a `RuntimeError`.
4. If `make_current` is not `None` and the current instance is `None`, set the current instance using `self.make_current()`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By fixing the logic flow as explained above, the corrected version of the `initialize` function now properly handles the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises the `RuntimeError` only when a new instance is trying to be created without proper conditions.
