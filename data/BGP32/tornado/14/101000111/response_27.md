The bug in the provided function `initialize` lies in the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The logic is intended to check whether an IOLoop instance already exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter. However, due to incorrect conditions and logic, the function fails to properly handle the situation where an IOLoop instance already exists but `make_current=False`.

Here is an explanation of the bug:

- When `make_current=True`, the function checks if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, it proceeds to make the current instance. This part of the logic seems correct.

- However, when `make_current=False`, the function is expected not to create a new IOLoop instance if one already exists. But the current implementation still tries to make the current instance even when `make_current=False`. This behavior is incorrect and leads to the reported error.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=False` and an existing IOLoop instance is present.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` to avoid redundant function calls.
- Then, based on the value of `make_current`, we check if a new IOLoop instance needs to be created or if an existing instance should be used. The logic for each case is correctly handled.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as intended under different scenarios.
