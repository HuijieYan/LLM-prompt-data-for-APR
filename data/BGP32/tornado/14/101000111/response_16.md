### 1. Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is None or not. If it is None, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then calls the `make_current` function. If `make_current` is not None and True, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None and raises a RuntimeError if it is None, otherwise it calls the `make_current` function.

### 2. Identified Errors
The buggy function does not handle the case where `make_current` is False. This leads to the undesired behavior when the `make_current` parameter is False and the current `IOLoop` instance is not None. 

### 3. Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not consider the scenario where `make_current` is False. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised in situations where it is not expected based on the current instance of `IOLoop`.

### 4. Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to include a condition to handle the case where `make_current` is False. This condition should ensure that `make_current` is only called if `make_current` is either None or True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

### 5. Corrected Version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # If make_current is False, do nothing
        pass
```

In the corrected version of the function, we have added an additional `else` condition to handle the case where `make_current` is False. This ensures that no RuntimeError is raised if `make_current` is False.
