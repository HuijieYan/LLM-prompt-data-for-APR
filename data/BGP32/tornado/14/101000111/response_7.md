## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not, based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. If `make_current` is not provided, the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If none exists, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop`.
3. If `make_current` is provided and `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it calls `self.make_current()`.

## Error Location
The error is likely in the conditional logic where the message "current IOLoop already exists" is raised when it should not be raised. This may happen if the existing `IOLoop` instance is not being correctly detected by `IOLoop.current()`.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the `initialize` function incorrectly handles the case when `make_current` is specified as `True` but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The condition to raise a `RuntimeError` is not being evaluated correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should also ensure that the detection of the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current()` is working as expected.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- Store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_loop` to reuse and avoid calling the function multiple times.
- Correctly handle the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- Ensure that in both cases of `make_current` being `None` or `True`, `self.make_current()` is called after the checks.

This corrected version should address the issue and correctly handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance.
