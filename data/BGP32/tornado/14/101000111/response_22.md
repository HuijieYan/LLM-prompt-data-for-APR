## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` takes an optional parameter `make_current` with a default value of `None`.
2. The `initialize` function checks the value of `make_current` and calls the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class accordingly.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`; it checks if the `current` method is `None` and raises an error if it is not.
4. The error is raised incorrectly because we are expecting the `current` method to be `None` when it should already exist.
5. The bug occurs due to the wrong condition checking logic in the `initialize` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by incorrect conditional checks in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the code incorrectly raises an error if the `current` method is not `None`, which contradicts the expected behavior.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. We should raise an error only if `make_current` is `True` and the `current` method is not `None`. In all other cases, we should make the current `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional check in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the error is only raised when the condition `make_current` is `True` and the `current` method already exists. Otherwise, the current `IOLoop` is initialized correctly.
