## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` parameter is not `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
3. The bug seems to be in the condition where a `RuntimeError` is raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and `make_current` is `True`, which seems contradictory.
4. A possible strategy to fix this bug is to update the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` to align with the expected behavior more logically.

## Correction
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the bug should be fixed, and the function `initialize` will behave as expected in the provided cases.
