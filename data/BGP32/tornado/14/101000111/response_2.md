## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and setting it as the current instance. 
2. The issue in the GitHub report mentions that the check at line 252 for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should not raise an error as the current `IOLoop` instance is already present.
3. However, due to the conditional checks in the buggy function, there is a possibility of raising the error even when the current `IOLoop` instance exists. This is due to the initial `if make_current is None` condition and then the subsequent check for an existing instance.
4. To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated to properly handle cases where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By updating the conditional logic, we first check if `make_current` is None or True. Then, we verify if the current `IOLoop` instance is None to decide whether to set it as the current instance or raise an error if it already exists. This corrected version should fix the bug and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
