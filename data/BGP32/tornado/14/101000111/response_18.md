The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists by calling the `current` method. If no `IOLoop` instance exists, it calls the `make_current` method to create one. However, when the `make_current` parameter is explicitly set to `True`, it should check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` without checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This contradicts the logic of the function and results in the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

To fix this bug, we need to include a check to verify if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. If an instance already exists, we should not create a new one and instead raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance` to avoid unnecessary redundant calls. Then, when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, we check if the `current_instance` is not `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`.

This fix addresses the issue posted on GitHub and ensures that no new `IOLoop` instance is created if one already exists when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
