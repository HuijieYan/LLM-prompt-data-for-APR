### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is expecting a `make_current` parameter, which if it is None or True, will trigger certain actions.
2. The bug seems to be related to a check where if `make_current` is None and the current IOLoop instance is not available, the code is expected to call the `make_current` method. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked twice with different actions inside the two branches.
3. The bug occurs because when `make_current` is None and the current IOLoop instance does not exist, the function fails to call the `make_current` method due to implementing different actions inside the two branches of the if-else statement.
4. To fix the bug, we need to refactor the conditional checks and logic for handling the `make_current` parameter appropriately.

### Bug Fix
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation
1. The bug was fixed by simplifying the logic inside the `initialize` function.
2. In the updated version, if `make_current` is None, we check if the current IOLoop instance does not exist and call `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is not None, we check if the current IOLoop instance exists and raise an error if it does, otherwise, we call `self.make_current()` as intended.
4. This approach ensures that the `make_current` method is correctly called based on the condition specified by the `make_current` parameter.
