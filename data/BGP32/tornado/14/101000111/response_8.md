### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` takes an optional parameter `make_current` and checks whether an instance of `IOLoop` is already current.
2. The issue seems to question why an error is being raised for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This might indicate a logic error in the `initialize` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` might be causing unexpected behavior.
2. The condition `elif make_current` might not be handling the existing `IOLoop` instance correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The bug may be due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The expectation of having an existing current `IOLoop` instance is not being properly validated in the `initialize` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter and existing `IOLoop` instance is correct in the `initialize` function.
2. Verify that the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is done properly before deciding to make it current.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
1. In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance`.
2. We then use this variable to determine the appropriate logic flow based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
3. The conditions are updated to correctly check if an existing current `IOLoop` instance is present before making any changes.
4. This corrected version should resolve the issue raised in GitHub and handle the logic more accurately.
