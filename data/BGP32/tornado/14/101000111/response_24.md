### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether the `make_current` parameter is None or not. Depending on the value of `make_current`, it either calls `self.make_current()` or raises a RuntimeError.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is not provided and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function returns None. This triggers the call to `self.make_current()` which should initialize the current IOLoop. However, if `make_current` is provided as True, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should raise a RuntimeError, but instead, it still calls `self.make_current()`.
3. The bug is causing inconsistent behavior where the `make_current` parameter is overridden and not accurately checking if the IOLoop already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is True, and the current IOLoop already exists, it should definitely raise the RuntimeError and not proceed to call `self.make_current()`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the conditions to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. We should raise the RuntimeError without calling `self.make_current()` in that case.
- Use proper conditional checks to ensure the correct behavior based on the input parameters.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version includes the fix for the bug by adding the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True but the current IOLoop already exists. Now, the function should behave as expected based on the input parameters and the bug raised in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
