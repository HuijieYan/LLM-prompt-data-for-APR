## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. It checks if `make_current` is provided, and if not, it ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is not already initialized before calling `make_current`.
2. The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`.
3. In the failing case, when `make_current` is `True`, the buggy function raises `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, which contradicts the logic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the conditional statement where `make_current` is `True`.


## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Correct the conditional statement that checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already initialized when `make_current` is `True`.
- Ensure that `make_current` is called only when necessary and that errors are raised appropriately.
- Update the logic to align with the intended behavior of the function.


## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    @classmethod
    def current(cls, instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
- We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` to avoid calling the function multiple times.
- The conditional logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not when `make_current` is `True` has been corrected.
- The function now ensures that `make_current` is only called when required and raises the `RuntimeError` only when the current instance already exists.

This corrected version should fix the bug and align with the expected input/output values and the reported GitHub issue.
