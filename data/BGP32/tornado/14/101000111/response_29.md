The bug in the provided function `initialize` arises from the incorrect logic applied during the conditional checks on whether to make the current IOLoop or raise an error. The issue arises from the comparison logic used to determine whether an IOLoop instance already exists or not.

### Error Location:
The potential error locations in the buggy function `initialize` are:
1. In the `if` block, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` incorrectly checks if an IOLoop instance exists instead of checking if it does not exist.
2. In the `elif` block, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly placed within the block, causing a contradiction in logic.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the function is due to the improper logic in checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop and handle cases where an instance already exists or needs to be created based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue comes from wrongly interpreting the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` when checking for an existing instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly determine the presence or absence of an IOLoop instance. This can be done by adjusting the conditions to check for the absence of a current instance. Additionally, the logic within the function should be refined to handle the cases of no instance and existing instance appropriately based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditions have been modified to check if an instance is not None, indicating the absence of an IOLoop instance. The logic now correctly handles the scenarios of creating a new IOLoop instance or raising an error if one already exists. This version should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values and criteria from the GitHub issue.
