### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object based on the input parameter `make_current`. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually None.
2. The problem lies in the comparison `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which contradicts the condition check for `make_current=True`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case where `make_current=True` but `IOLoop.current` is `None`, leading to the incorrect raising of the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition check for `make_current` and handle the case when `IOLoop.current` is `None` according to the specific conditions.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the case where `make_current=True`, we ensure that the error is only raised when an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This correction maintains the expected behavior of the function based on the provided test case.
