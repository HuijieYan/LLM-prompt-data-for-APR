Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
2. The comparison condition of `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might be causing the issue.

Cause of the bug:
1. In the `initialize` function, there is a check to ensure that the current `IOLoop` does not already exist before setting a new one as current. However, the comparison condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as intended, leading to incorrect behavior.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the comparison condition within the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance to avoid raising the "already exists" error when it is not necessary.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False): # Check if current IOLoop does not exist
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False): # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should handle the case appropriately and prevent the "already exists" error from being raised incorrectly.
