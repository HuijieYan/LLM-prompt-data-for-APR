### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is expected to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The issue is related to line 252 where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True.
3. The bug occurs because regardless of the condition in the `initialize` function, it will try to set the current `IOLoop` instance, leading to the unexpected `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to only set the current `IOLoop` instance when necessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `None`, if so, set the current `IOLoop` instance only if it doesn't already exist.
2. If `make_current` is provided and set to `True`, only set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't already exist.
3. Avoid setting the current `IOLoop` instance if it already exists to prevent the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the corrected `initialize` function will only set the current `IOLoop` instance if necessary and prevent the `RuntimeError` from occurring.
