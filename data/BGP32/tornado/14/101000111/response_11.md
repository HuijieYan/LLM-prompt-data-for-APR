### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` in the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is None or True, and then makes a decision based on the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function.
3. The bug seems to be related to how the function handles the case when `make_current` is True.
4. The reported GitHub issue suggests that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, the function still raises a RuntimeError which seems incorrect.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is None or True. If it is True, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if so raises a RuntimeError. However, there seems to be a logical error in the condition checking. The intention appears to be that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should not raise an error as it is checking if the object already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition checking inside the `initialize` function where `make_current` is True. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, the function should skip raising the RuntimeError. It should only raise the error if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

### Corrected Version

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The change made in the corrected version is in the conditional statement that raises the RuntimeError. Now, the error will only be raised if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. This modification addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
