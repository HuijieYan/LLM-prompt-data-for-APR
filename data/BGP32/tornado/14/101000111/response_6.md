## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current instance of the `IOLoop`. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which determines whether the current instance should be set immediately.
2. The bug seems to be related to the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance. If one does not already exist and `make_current` is not provided or is `True`, it should proceed with setting the current instance. If `make_current` is provided but an instance already exists, it should raise an error.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect check in the `elif make_current:` block. Currently, if `make_current` is `True`, the code proceeds with setting the current instance without checking if it already exists. This leads to the error being raised even though a new instance should be created in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that in the case where `make_current` is `True`, we only proceed to set the current instance if none currently exists. If an instance already exists in this scenario, we should not raise an error and simply return.
5. Additionally, we should handle the situation where `make_current` is `False` and explicitly do not set the current instance.
6. We need to correct the `initialize` function to match the expected behavior.

## Bug Fix

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        pass
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the scenarios where `make_current` is `True`, `False`, or `None`, setting the current instance based on the conditions provided.
