### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None, then it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is None, `self.make_current()` is called. If `make_current` is not None and True, then it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None. If not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub suggests that there might be a confusion regarding the logic of when to raise the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance is None is inconsistent between `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current`. In the `elif make_current` block, it should check for the presence of the current instance instead of checking for `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is not None and True. This means we need to ensure that a new IOLoop instance is created only if there is no current instance present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, in the `elif make_current` block, we check if the current IOLoop instance is not None before raising the `RuntimeError`.
This adjustment ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance when one already exists.
