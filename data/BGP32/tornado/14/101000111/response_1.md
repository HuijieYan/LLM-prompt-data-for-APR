## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` object by setting the current loop if it's not already set.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking if a current loop already exists and whether to make the loop current based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current loop's existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic based on the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and the function's intended functionality.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `make_current` is `True`, set the loop current if it doesn't already exist, else raise an error.
2. If `make_current` is `None` or `False`, then only set the loop current if it doesn't already exist.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is True:
            if current is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if current is None:
                self.make_current()
```

By correcting the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the function should now behave according to the expected input/output values and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
