### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance by making it current. The function checks if a current instance of IOLoop exists and then makes the current instance if it doesn't exist.
2. The bug seems to lie in the condition where `make_current` is `True`. In this case, the function should first check if a current instance of IOLoop exists before making the current instance. However, the current logic is incorrect and directly raises an error without properly checking.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function directly attempts to make the current instance without verifying if one already exists. This leads to the incorrect error being raised.
4. To fix the bug, the function should modify the logic for the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should first check if a current instance of IOLoop exists before either raising an error or making the current instance.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition within the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True,` we ensure that there is proper validation of the existing current instance of IOLoop before attempting to make it current or raising an error.
