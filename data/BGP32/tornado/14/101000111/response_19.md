### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not using the `IOLoop.current()` function.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the function wrongly attempts to raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function, where it misinterprets the conditions for raising the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when the `make_current` parameter is `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditions inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, we should only raise the error if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` has been inverted so that it only triggers if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`. This adjustment ensures the correct behavior of the `initialize` function based on the input parameters.
