### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` object with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even though the function is intended to set the current loop if it doesn't exist.
3. The failing test, `test_force_current`, explicitly tests the scenario where `make_current` is `True`.
4. The bug is due to the conditional check on `make_current` not aligning with the intention of the function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic to set the current loop only when it is not already set if `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly set the current loop only if it doesn't already exist when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class details...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the conditional logic above, the corrected function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.
