The bug in the `initialize` method is that it incorrectly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new `IOLoop` instance current when `make_current` is `True`. The bug arises from the condition in the `if` block checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` when it should be checking if it is not `None` in order to prevent reinitializing the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the `if` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. This will prevent reinitializing the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and prevent reinitializing the current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
