### Correction

To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True`, we check if an existing current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make the current one. If it does, we should raise a `RuntimeError` as shown in the failing test.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the current one. If `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`, satisfying the failing test.
