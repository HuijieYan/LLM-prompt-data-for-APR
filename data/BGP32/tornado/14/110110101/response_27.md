### Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is attempting to check if the current `IOLoop` exists and make it current based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation.

When `make_current=True`, the function is expected to set the current `IOLoop`. If an `IOLoop` instance is already current, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. But in the existing implementation, it incorrectly raises the `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the existing implementation checks for the presence of the current `IOLoop` incorrectly. It raises an error even if no `IOLoop` instance is currently set as the current instance.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize()` function to correctly determine when to set the `IOLoop` as current and when to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if a current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Set the current IOLoop
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Make current if there is none
        self.make_current()
```

### Note:
The corrected code now correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before raising a `RuntimeError`. It handles the case of `make_current=True` as expected, setting the current `IOLoop` only if there is no current instance already.
