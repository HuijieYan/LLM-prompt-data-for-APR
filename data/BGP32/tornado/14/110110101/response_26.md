The cause of the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` before trying to make itself current. This check is unnecessary because when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it should try to make the current `IOLoop` instance regardless of its existence.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to directly call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True`, without prior checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

The corrected version eliminates the unnecessary check and directly calls `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True`. This modification ensures that the `IOLoop` instance is correctly made current when needed.
