## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class initializes the instance of `IOLoop` and ensures it becomes the current `IOLoop` if specified.
2. In the failing test, it tries to create an instance with `make_current=True`, expects the instance to become the current `IOLoop`, and raises a `RuntimeError` if an attempt is made to create another current `IOLoop`.
3. The error occurs when a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is attempted to be created, even though the first instance is already the current `IOLoop`.
4. The buggy function has a logic error where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, regardless of whether a current instance exists.
5. To fix this bug, we need to check if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance before trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make a new instance the current one.
2. If `make_current=True` is specified and there is already a current instance, do not raise an error.
3. Only try to make the instance the current if it is new.

## Bug Fix
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
            elif current_instance != self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

The above corrected version of the buggy function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
