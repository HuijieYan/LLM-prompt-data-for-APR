### Analyzing the buggy function

1. **Buggy function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then sets the instance as the current one if necessary.

2. **Relationship with the test code**: The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set it as the current instance. However, if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

3. **Error location**: The error occurs when the function tries to set the current `IOLoop` instance even though it already exists, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.

4. **Cause of the bug**: The bug stems from the fact that the function does not correctly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. It should check this condition before attempting to make the new instance current.

### Strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function logic to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does and `make_current=True`, we should raise a `RuntimeError`. We should only make the new instance current if a current instance does not already exist.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```
