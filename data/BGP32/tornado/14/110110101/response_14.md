### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of an instance of the `IOLoop` class with an optional parameter `make_current` which determines if the new instance should become the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, instead of raising an error, it incorrectly tries to set the current `IOLoop` to the new instance again.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current` to `True` when initializing an `IOLoop` instance and then tries to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` again, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. The test fails because the bug causes the second initialization to mistakenly set the current `IOLoop` without raising the error.
4. To fix the bug, the code should raise the `RuntimeError` when attempting to set the current `IOLoop` to a new instance with `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, instead of trying to reassign the current instance. Additionally, the bug also incorrectly calls `self.make_current()` in the `initialize` function, which is unnecessary.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter:
   - If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, raise a `RuntimeError`.
   - Remove the unnecessary call to `self.make_current()`.
2. Update the logic to ensure that the current instance is not reassigned when creating a new instance with `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
