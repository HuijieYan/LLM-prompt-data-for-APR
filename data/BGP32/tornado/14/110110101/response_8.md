### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and only makes the current instance if `make_current` is `True`. 
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance where `make_current` is `True` and checks if making the current instance fails with a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs because the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, but it falsely raises an error if it doesn't exist.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to only raise an error when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix ensures that a `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of the `IOLoop`.

By applying this fix, the failing test `test_force_current` should now pass without any errors.
