### Analysis
1. The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class decides whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, as it raises a `RuntimeError` that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to test this scenario by creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then trying to create another one, which should fail due to the already existing current `IOLoop`.
4. To fix the bug, the check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` needs to be adjusted.
5. The corrected version will have a modified logic to handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`. If `make_current=False`, the new `IOLoop` should not try to become current. 

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in `elif make_current:` to check if the current `IOLoop` exists instead of not existing, the bug is fixed.

Now the `initialize` method will behave as expected when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.

This fixed version should pass the failing test.
