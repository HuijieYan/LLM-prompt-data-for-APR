### Analysis
1. **Bug:** The bug in the function `initialize` is that it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`.
  
2. **Cause of the bug:** 
   - If `make_current=True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is an instance present, it should raise an error.
   - The buggy code checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop`, but it does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` is already present. It incorrectly proceeds to try to make the calling `IOLoop` instance the current one, even if one is already set.
  
3. **Strategy for fixing the bug:**
   - Modify the code to check if `make_current` is `True` and if a current instance already exists, raise an error instead of proceeding further.
  
### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
