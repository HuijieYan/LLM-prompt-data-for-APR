### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The error message indicates that the code attempts to create a new current `IOLoop` instance when one already exists, triggering a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance current.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before setting the new instance as current.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

This updated version checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to set a new instance as current.
