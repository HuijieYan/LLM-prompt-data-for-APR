1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado` module. This function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and ensuring it is current if needed.

2. The potential error location is within the condition `elif make_current`. Here, the code is checking if `make_current` is `True` and then verifying if the current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, the code raises a `RuntimeError`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True`, regardless of whether a current IOLoop instance exists or not. In the failing test case provided, the test tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` twice, but the second attempt should raise a `RuntimeError` because a current IOLoop instance already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance of IOLoop already exists. If `make_current=True` and there is no current instance, we should proceed to make the IOLoop instance current.

5. Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other parts of the class code are omitted for brevity

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic inside the `initialize` function now correctly checks if `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. If a current instance exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it proceeds to make the IOLoop instance current.
