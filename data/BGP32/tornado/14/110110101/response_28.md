### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` in the `initialize` function may be incorrectly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
2. The condition `if make_current:` in the `initialize` function may not be handling the case where `make_current=True` properly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the logic that checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The function is trying to prevent creating multiple current instances of `IOLoop`, but the condition checking for the existence of a current instance is faulty. This leads to the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` as shown in the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the logic for checking the existing current `IOLoop` instance. We need to make sure that a new `IOLoop` instance is only set as the current instance if there is no existing current instance. Additionally, we need to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance to properly check for its existence. Then, we adjust the logic to correctly handle setting the current instance based on the `make_current` argument. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
