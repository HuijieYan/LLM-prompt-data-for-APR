### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and set itself as current if not.
2. The bug occurs when trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance even if there is already one and `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The buggy method does not check whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting itself as current.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to set the current instance inside the `initialize` function.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
