## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to ensure that only one instance of the `IOLoop` can be the current instance in the main thread. It checks whether an `IOLoop` instance is already the current one, and if so, raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` calls the `initialize` method with `make_current=True` to force the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance with the intention of making it the current one. This is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` since the current `IOLoop` instance is already set.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is indeed being raised as expected.
4. The bug in the code is that the `make_current` method is called unconditionally in the `initialize` function if `make_current=None`, even when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This leads to the new instance always trying to become the current, even when it shouldn't.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance the current one.

## Bug Fix
I will modify the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance the current one.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
