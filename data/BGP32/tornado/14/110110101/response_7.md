### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None` and calls `self.make_current()` if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, otherwise, it calls `self.make_current()`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects it to become the current `IOLoop`, and then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. The error occurred when the second `IOLoop(make_current=True)` constructor was called, as the current `IOLoop` instance was not `None.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation occurs because the function does not correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After applying this fix, the corrected function should pass the failing test case.
