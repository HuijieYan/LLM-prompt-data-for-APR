### Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is `True`. It is raising a `RuntimeError` even though the intention is to make the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

The issue lies in the logic that checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should allow the creation of the instance as the new current `IOLoop`. However, due to the check in the `if` condition, it is incorrectly raising an exception.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be modified so that when `make_current` is `True`, it creates the new `IOLoop` instance and makes it the current instance without checking if a current instance already exists.


### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other parts of the class and comments remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            # Allow creating a new current IOLoop without checking for existing instance
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and will not raise a `RuntimeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
