### Analysis
- The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current instance.
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance already present. Instead of creating and setting a new instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` which is not the intended behavior.
- The bug is caused by not creating a new current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and no current instance exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to create and set a new current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current instance. We should remove the check for an existing current instance when `make_current` is `True` and allow the function to proceed with creating a new current instance.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
