### Incorrect function analysis

#### Error location:
1. The `initialize` function is checking if `make_current` is `True`, and if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. It should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, because it should raise an error if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the function is caused by the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. It mistakenly checks for the absence of the current IOLoop instance when it should check for its presence.

#### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition check in the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
