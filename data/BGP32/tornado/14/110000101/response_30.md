Based on the buggy function provided, the issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` function. The buggy function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and handle whether it should become the current `IOLoop` or not based on the `make_current` parameter.

The issue arises from the current logic flow:
- If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it should make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it should raise an error.
However, the condition to raise an error when `make_current` is `True` is placed after the condition to check for the absence of a current instance of `IOLoop`, which results in an incorrect execution flow.

To fix this bug, we need to rearrange the conditions in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are checked in the correct order and the logic behaves as intended for handling the `make_current` parameter.
