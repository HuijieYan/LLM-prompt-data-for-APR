### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance already. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised instead of setting the current instance.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the condition where `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. The intention is to set the current instance in this case, but the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the code to set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance. This can be achieved by removing the `RuntimeError` raise statement in that condition and instead call the `self.make_current()` method.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
``` 

The corrected version checks if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, then it sets the current instance by calling `self.make_current()`.
