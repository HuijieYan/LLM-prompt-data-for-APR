### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance as the current one based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there are some issues in the implementation:
1. The condition to check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect.
2. The method `make_current()` is not called correctly.

### Bug Explanation
- When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there isn't, it should set the current one. If there is, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The `make_current()` method should be called on `self` (current object) after the conditions are checked.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `make_current` is `True`, and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. If not, set the current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Call the `make_current()` method correctly on `self`.

### Corrected version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
