### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance.
- The bug seems to be related to the logic of setting the current IOLoop instance.
- The expected behavior is:
  - If `make_current` is `True`, set the current IOLoop instance.
  - If `make_current` is `False`, do not set the current IOLoop instance.
  - If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, set the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Explanation
- In the current implementation:
  - If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is a current IOLoop instance and sets it if not.
  - If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is a current IOLoop instance and raises an error if there is.
- The issue is that it checks for a current IOLoop instance in both cases without considering the current value of `make_current`.
- This causes the function to throw a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance because it fails to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- We need to modify the logic so that it correctly sets the current IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current`.
- When `make_current` is `True`, we should set the current instance if it does not already exist, and when `make_current` is `False`, we should not set the current instance.
- It is important to differentiate between the two cases and only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I added a condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is `True`. If it exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised; otherwise, the current instance is set. This fix ensures the correct behavior based on the value of `make_current` and handles the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.
