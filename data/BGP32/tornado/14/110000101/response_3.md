### Analysis
- The `initialize` function is intended to set the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True`.
- However, the logic in the function has a bug where it checks if a current IOLoop instance exists and then tries to make the current instance, which can lead to an incorrect state.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The code is missing the implementation of the `make_current` method which should set the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Cause
- The bug arises from the incorrect handling of setting the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
- If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, the logic incorrectly proceeds to make the current instance instead of raising an error.

### Fix Strategy
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle setting the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
- If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError` instead of trying to make the current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
