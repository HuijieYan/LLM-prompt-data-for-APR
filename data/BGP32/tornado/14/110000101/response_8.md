### Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. 
1. In the `if` block, when `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and if not, it sets the current instance to the current object.
2. In the `elif` block, when `make_current` is `True`, it is supposed to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if one already exists. Then it should set the current instance to the current object.

The bug occurs in the `elif` block because the existing check for a current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. It should check if there is no current instance instead of checking if there is one already.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `elif` block to check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. This ensures that the `IOLoop` instance is only set as current if no current instance already exists.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
