The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance present. However, there is a bug in the current implementation where the condition for checking the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. In this case, instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the function incorrectly calls `self.make_current()`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition for checking the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. The corrected version should raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises the `RuntimeError` as expected.
