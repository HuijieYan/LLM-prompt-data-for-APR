### Analysis
In the buggy function `initialize`, there seems to be an issue with the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is intended to check the current `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance if necessary. However, the condition `if make_current is None` combined with `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect as it should check if `make_current` is `False` in this case.

### Bug Explanation
- When `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` only when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- The current condition `if make_current is None` and `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` causes incorrect behavior and fails to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.

### Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition where `make_current` is `None` to check if it is `False` instead.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is `True` and when it is `False`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is not None:
            current_instance.clear_current()
```
