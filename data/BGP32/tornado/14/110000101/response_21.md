## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there are issues with the logic in the function that may cause unexpected behavior.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the function `initialize` is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before making the current instance. This check should instead ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` to proceed further.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks in the function. Specifically, when `make_current` is `True`, we should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before setting the current instance. Additionally, we need to remove the check for `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

## Code Correction
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By applying the above correction to the `initialize` function, we ensure that the logic correctly handles setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
