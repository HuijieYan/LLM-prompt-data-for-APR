### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, it has a bug where the logic to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. The bug lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` which incorrectly checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to change the condition to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance instead of checking if there is none. This will ensure that the function correctly handles the case where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change to check if there is a current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
