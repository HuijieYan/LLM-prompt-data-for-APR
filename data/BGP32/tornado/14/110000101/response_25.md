The bug in the provided function `initialize()` lies in the condition where it checks if `make_current` is `True`. In this case, if `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before setting it as the current instance. However, the function incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None instead of not None before setting it as the current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where `make_current` is `True` to check if the current instance is not None.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ... (omitted for brevity)
    """

    # corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected the condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before setting it as the current instance.
