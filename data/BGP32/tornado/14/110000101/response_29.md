### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and there is no current instance already.
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and there is no current instance, it should set the current instance instead of raising a `RuntimeError`.
- The bug is because the `self.make_current()` function is not called when `make_current` is True and there is no current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check if `make_current` is True and there is no current `IOLoop` instance before trying to set it.
- Call the `self.make_current()` function when necessary to properly set the current `IOLoop` instance.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
