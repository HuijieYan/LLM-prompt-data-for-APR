### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, there is a bug in the logic which is causing an incorrect behavior.

### Bug Explanation
1. When `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None` and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. This part of the logic is correct.
2. When `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`. If it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` which is incorrect. It should actually set the current `IOLoop` in this case.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists, the function should set the current `IOLoop`.
2. This can be achieved by removing the `raise RuntimeError(...)` line and directly calling `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```
