### Analysis
- The `initialize` function checks the `make_current` parameter to determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be made active.
- There is an issue in the logic where it checks if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The issue arises because it does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should simply exit without raising an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance to avoid raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```
