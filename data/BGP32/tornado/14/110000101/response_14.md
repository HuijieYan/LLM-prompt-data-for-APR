### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there are issues with the logic that determines whether to make the current IOLoop or raise an error.

### Identified Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition where `make_current` is `None`. In this case, if there is no current IOLoop instance, the function should make the current IOLoop. However, the current implementation of `self.make_current()` will result in an error as `make_current` is not a method but a parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current IOLoop instance, set the instance as the current IOLoop.
2. Check if `make_current` is `True`, and if there is no current IOLoop instance, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Remove the incorrect `self.make_current()` call.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.current()
```
