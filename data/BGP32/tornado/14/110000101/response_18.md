### Analysis
- The `initialize` function is checking a condition for `make_current` being `None`, however, in the expected case, it should be `True`.
- The condition to raise a `RuntimeError` is not correctly implemented.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition checking for the value of `make_current`. When `make_current` is provided as `True`, the function should set the current `IOLoop` instance, but the existing condition does not handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for `make_current` being `None` and adjust the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Implementation
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, we are now correctly handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and raising a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
