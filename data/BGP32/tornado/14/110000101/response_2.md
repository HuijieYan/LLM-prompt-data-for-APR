### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks if the current instance already exists. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and an instance already exists.

### Bug Explanation
1. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. If a current instance exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. However, the current logic in the buggy function allows the `IOLoop` instance to be set as current even if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above adjustment, the corrected `initialize` function will properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
