### Analyze the buggy function

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance and set it as the current IOLoop if necessary. 

### Identify potential error locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used but there is no `current` method defined in the `IOLoop` class.
2. The `self.make_current()` method is called without a clear definition of what it does.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug lies in the incorrect usage of the `IOLoop.current()` method in the `initialize` function, as it is being called with a parameter `instance=False` which is not defined. This leads to a faulty logic in determining whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. If the intention is to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, the `current` method should be called without any parameters.
2. The assignment of `make_current` value should follow the correct logic based on whether it is `None`, `True`, or `False`.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
