### Analyzing the buggy function
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and optionally make it the current instance.
- The bug seems to be related to the logic for setting the current instance. The `make_current` argument is not being properly handled in the current implementation.
- The bug causes the function to potentially set the current instance even when it should not or raise a `RuntimeError` when it should set the current instance.

### Potential Error Locations
- The condition `if make_current is None:` may be incorrectly handling the `make_current` argument.
- The check for the current instance and the logic for setting the current instance seem to be problematic.
- The condition `elif make_current:` may not be handling the `make_current` argument correctly.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the way it handles the `make_current` argument.
- When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current instance and then tries to make the instance current.
- When `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if there is no current instance and then raises a `RuntimeError` if so, before making the instance current.
- However, the logic is flawed and may result in incorrect behavior when setting the current instance.

### Suggested Bug Fix
- We need to ensure that the `make_current` argument is correctly handled to set the current instance only when explicitly requested.
- The conditions checking for the current instance and setting the current instance need to be adjusted to avoid conflicts and ensure the correct behavior based on the `make_current` argument.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # No specific request to make it current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # No current instance
            self.make_current()  # Make this instance current
    elif make_current:  # Explicit request to make it current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Make this instance current
```

### Additional Note
- The corrected version of the function above ensures that the `make_current` argument is properly handled to set the current instance only when explicitly requested.
