### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with the logic for checking and setting the current `IOLoop` instance. 
- The function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current one, if necessary, based on the `make_current` parameter.
- However, the bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug location
The bug is located in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the case when `make_current` is True and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. Instead of raising an error, it attempts to set the new instance as the current one, causing unexpected behavior.

### Strategy to fix the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. We should raise an error in this situation and prevent the new instance from becoming the current one.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and prevent unexpected behavior when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
