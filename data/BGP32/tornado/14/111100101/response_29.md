### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then calls the `make_current` function. 
3. If `make_current` is True, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then raises a RuntimeError if an attempt is made to create a new current instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if the `IOLoop` instance can be forced to be the current instance and ensures that an error is raised if a second attempt is made to do so.

### Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to True. It should only raise a RuntimeError if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and an attempt is made to create a new current instance.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a RuntimeError when trying to create a new current instance with `make_current=True` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After applying the correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True, ensuring the expected behavior during the failing test.
