### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` checks whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` but it does not, leading to incorrect behavior.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects it to become the current instance, then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance also with `make_current=True`, which should result in a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, the bug is fixed. The corrected function will pass the failing test.
