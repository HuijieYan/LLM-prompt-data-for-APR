## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and sets itself as the current if not.
2. The bug occurs in the logic where `make_current` is passed as `True` but it still checks if there is a current instance or not.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if the `make_current` parameter works as expected by ensuring that a second call to `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by unnecessarily checking for the current `IOLoop` instance even when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should remove the check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` since in such a case we want to force setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
