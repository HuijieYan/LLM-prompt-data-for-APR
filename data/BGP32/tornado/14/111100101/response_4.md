### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is not provided, it should set the current instance only if there is no current instance already.
2. The issue in the buggy function lies in the condition where it checks if there is no current instance and tries to set the current instance even if `make_current` is `False`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` checks that attempting to create a new current `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` after one already exists should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where `make_current` is `False` to not set the current instance. 

### Bug:
The buggy function sets the current `IOLoop` instance even when `make_current` is `False`, which is incorrect behavior based on the expected output and the failing test.

### Fix:
Modify the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance. Do not set the current instance if `make_current` is `False`.

### Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
