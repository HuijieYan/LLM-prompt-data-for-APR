### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the class instance and ensure that it becomes the current `IOLoop` instance if needed.
2. The buggy function currently has an issue where if `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists before making itself the current instance. If an instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance and any subsequent attempts to create a new current instance should result in a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is set to `True`, we make the current instance the new instance without raising an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to ensure that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the current instance is set to the new instance without checking for the existence of a current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            # Set current instance without checking for existing instance
            self.make_current()
```
