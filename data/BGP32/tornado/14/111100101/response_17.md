### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
2. The bug occurs when checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the current implementation is that it is not properly checking for a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`. The current implementation does not raise an error if there is already a current instance, which causes the failing test to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for `make_current=True` to correctly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is a current instance and `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if make_current is True and there is already a current instance
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    
    # Check if make_current is None and there is no current instance
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test provided.
