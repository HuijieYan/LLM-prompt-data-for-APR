### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current instance of `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `None` or `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should only set the current instance if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. In the failing test `test_force_current`, it is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and check if it becomes the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.
3. The bug in the current implementation is that it does not handle the case when `make_current` is `True` properly. It checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error but makes the current `IOLoop` instance regardless.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation lies in not correctly handling the scenario when `make_current=True`. It should only set the current instance if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, but the current implementation makes the current `IOLoop` instance even if there is already one.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
