### Explanation
The buggy `initialize` function is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` class, including making the current `IOLoop` instance. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This bug causes the test function `test_force_current` to fail when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. The correct condition should be `if IOLoop.current() is self or IOLoop.current() is None`.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition inside the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is either the same as the current instance being initialized or if no current instance exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is self or IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` class instance and pass the failing test.
