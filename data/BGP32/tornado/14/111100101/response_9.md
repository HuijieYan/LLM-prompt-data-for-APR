### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then calls `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if it is `True` and then again calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and `self.make_current()`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `IOLoop` is initialized with `make_current=True`, it should set the current `IOLoop`, and subsequent attempts to initialize another `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The current implementation does not correctly handle the case of trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

### Bug
The bug is in the logic of the `initialize` function when checking if `make_current` is `True` and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. It currently allows the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance even when there is already an existing current `IOLoop`, which contradicts the expected behavior of the failing test.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `make_current=True` and if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
