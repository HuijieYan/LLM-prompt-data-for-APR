### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` class with the option to make the instance the current `IOLoop`.
2. The issue arises when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, causing a conflict with an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checked after setting `make_current=True`, which leads to the RuntimeError being erroneously raised.
4. We need to re-order the conditions in the `initialize` function to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance first before attempting to set it as the current instance.
5. By adjusting the order of the conditions and including proper checks, we can ensure that the `make_current` functionality works as intended without conflicting with an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
