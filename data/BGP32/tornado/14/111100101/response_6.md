### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance if needed.
2. The buggy part of the function checks if the `make_current` parameter is provided:
   - If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then sets the current IOLoop.
   - If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance and then sets the current IOLoop.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, assert it as the current instance, and then try to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. The bug lies in the fact that the code logic does not handle the case where a new IOLoop instance is created with `make_current=True` even if there is already an existing current instance.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs because it does not check if there is already a current IOLoop instance when `make_current=True` is provided. It simply tries to set the current instance without considering the existing state, leading to the second construction attempt in the test case to fail without raising an error.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case where there is already a current instance when `make_current=True` is provided. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case to prevent a new IOLoop instance from becoming the current one when it should not.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
