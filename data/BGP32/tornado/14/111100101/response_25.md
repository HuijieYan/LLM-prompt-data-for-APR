### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, with an optional parameter `make_current`.
- The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.
- There seems to be an issue with the logic of checking and setting the current instance.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function expecting to force the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `True` and if there is no active current instance of `IOLoop`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, even though `make_current` was explicitly set to `True`.
- This bug causes an incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and does not force the creation of a new current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Fix the bug by adjusting the logic to properly handle the case when `make_current=True`.
- Ensure that when `make_current=True`, a new instance of `IOLoop` is set as the current instance without raising any errors.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
