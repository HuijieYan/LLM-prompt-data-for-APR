### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is `True`. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks for the current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists before making itself the current instance.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.
4. To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.


### Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to check if a current instance exists instead of checking if it doesn't exist, we ensure that the function correctly handles the case when `make_current=True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.
