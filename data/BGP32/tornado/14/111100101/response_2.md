### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and optionally make it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The bug occurs in the logic to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before making the new instance current.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the case where there is no current instance but `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance current.
2. Only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is `True`.
3. Update the logic to handle the conditions correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise error only if there is a current instance
        self.make_current()
```
