### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` if no current instance exists.
2. The bug occurs due to the incorrect check for the current `IOLoop` instance. The function incorrectly checks for the existence of a current instance when `make_current` is `True`, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised in the test.
3. The correct behavior should be to only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, but to make the instance current regardless of the value of `make_current` if no current instance is present.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

### Fix
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            if make_current is None or make_current:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

By making the adjustments outlined above, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
