### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` object, checking if it needs to become the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, checking if it becomes the current instance and ensuring that trying to create another current instance raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs when the function incorrectly allows creating a new current instance when one already exists.

### Bug Explanation
In the buggy function `initialize`, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If one does not exist, it calls `self.make_current()` to make the current instance. However, the bug is that even if a current instance exists, it still calls `self.make_current()`, allowing for the creation of multiple current instances. This behavior is incorrect as only one `IOLoop` instance should be the current instance.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance does not already exist. If a current instance exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
