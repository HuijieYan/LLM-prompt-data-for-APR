### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop`. It checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True` and then calls the `make_current` function accordingly.
2. The issue lies in the logic of checking if a current `IOLoop` exists. The logic is inverted, causing the function to behave unexpectedly.
3. The bug causes the function to incorrectly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` and fails to handle the `make_current=True` case correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to properly handle both cases of `make_current=None` and `make_current=True`.
5. A corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` parameter and handle the case where `make_current=True` as expected.
