The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make the current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. We can use a conditional check to ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, the current `IOLoop` instance must exist before attempting to make it the current instance. If it doesn't exist, then we raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
