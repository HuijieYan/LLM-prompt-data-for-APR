### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class initializes the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The bug occurs in the logic related to making the `IOLoop` instance the current one.
3. The bug causes an error to be raised even if the `make_current` parameter is `True`.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the instance is made the current one without checking if one already exists.


### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class when handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, the function currently raises a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, even if the intention is to force the current instance. This behavior is not consistent with the expected behavior described in the test case, leading to a failing test.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when `make_current` is `True`. The modified logic will make the instance the current one without checking if one already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
	    self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test case mentioned above.
