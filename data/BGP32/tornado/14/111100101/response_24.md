### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object and potentially make it the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`. The code correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if one is already present. However, the bug lies in not correctly handling the case when no current instance exists initially.
3. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance initially. This is incorrect behavior as the `RuntimeError` should only be raised if an instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to only raise a `RuntimeError` if an existing current `IOLoop` instance is detected when `make_current` is set to `True`.
5. I will update the code to only raise a `RuntimeError` if an existing current `IOLoop` instance is detected when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
