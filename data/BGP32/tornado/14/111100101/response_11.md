### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't already exist (when `make_current` is not provided), or to raise an error if trying to create a second current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The failing test case `test_force_current` aims to test the behavior of setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug in the code lies in the logic check for creating the current `IOLoop` instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be inverted to check if the current instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the condition to check for the existence of the current instance properly.

### Updated Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By adjusting the conditions in the `initialize` function, it ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is only set once and raises an error if trying to set it again.
