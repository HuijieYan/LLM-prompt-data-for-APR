### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. If `make_current` is `None`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and make the newly created instance the current one. If `make_current` is `True`, it should make the newly created instance the current one and raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`.
2. The buggy function fails when `make_current` is `True` because it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` with `instance=False`, which does not make sense in the context of the `initialize` function.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` will make it the current `IOLoop`, and subsequent attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should fail.

### Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs due to incorrect usage of the `current` function with `instance=False`.

### Fix
We need to modify the way we check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
