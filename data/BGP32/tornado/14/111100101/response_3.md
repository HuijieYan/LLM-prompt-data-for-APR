### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop`.
2. The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it makes the new instance the current one.
3. The bug seems to be in the condition where `make_current=True`. It checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, it raises an error. This is incorrect behavior as it should not raise an error if `make_current=True`.
4. To fix the bug, the condition when `make_current=True` should simply call `self.make_current()` without checking if a current instance already exists.

### Bug:
The bug is in the condition `elif make_current:` where it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, even though `make_current=True` should force the creation of a new instance.

### Fix:
Simply remove the check for a current instance in the `elif make_current:` condition.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        # Always make the new IOLoop the current one
        self.make_current()
```
