### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is designed to initialize the IOLoop class. It checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another IOLoop instance with the same parameter, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs when the second IOLoop instance is attempted to create with `make_current=True` even though the current IOLoop instance already exists.
4. The bug is in the `initialize` function where it checks for `make_current` to be true but does not handle the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to check first if the current IOLoop instance already exists before proceeding with creating a new one.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if the current IOLoop instance already exists at the beginning of the `initialize` function.
2. If `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. If `make_current` is not specified, proceed with making the current IOLoop instance.
4. Update the logic to handle multiple instances correctly.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        if make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing the corrected version of the `initialize` function, it will now properly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one with the `make_current` flag set to `True`. This fix will ensure that the function behaves as expected in the given test scenario and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
