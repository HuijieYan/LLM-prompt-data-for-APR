### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If an `IOLoop` instance is already present and `make_current=True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. It then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as the first instance already set the current `IOLoop`.

3. The error message shows that the `RuntimeError` is being raised correctly when attempting to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function wrongly checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`. It should not allow the construction of a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if an `IOLoop` instance is already set as current.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance is already set as current. We should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None when `make_current=True` before allowing the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance. If an `IOLoop` instance already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the scenario where an `IOLoop` instance is already set as current and a new instance is being created with `make_current=True`.
