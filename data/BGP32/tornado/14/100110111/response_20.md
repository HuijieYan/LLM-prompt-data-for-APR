### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is designed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and make it current if it doesn't. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current` is not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then tries to create another one with the same parameter, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The error occurs when the second `IOLoop(make_current=True)` call is made because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the check for this condition is not correctly implemented in the `initialize` function.
4. The correct strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function only checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before attempting to make the loop current. However, when `make_current=True`, it should also check if the current loop already exists before trying to make it current. This logic oversight leads to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to include an additional check when `make_current=True` to see if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, then raise the `RuntimeError`, as it is not possible to have two current `IOLoop` instances simultaneously.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding the check for the existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, we can correctly prevent the creation of a second current instance and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised as expected.
