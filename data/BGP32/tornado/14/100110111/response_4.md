### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is designed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance. The function accepts a parameter `make_current` which is expected to be a boolean value to determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be set.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is testing the scenario where `make_current=True` is provided, and the expectation is that it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when an existing `IOLoop` instance is detected, but the test is expecting this behavior. Therefore, the issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` function when `make_current` is true and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists as it is not handling this case as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is true and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This behavior is not aligned with the expectations of the test case `test_force_current` which is designed to verify the error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is true and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the function should skip setting the current `IOLoop` to avoid the conflict.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            return  # Skip setting current loop if it already exists
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the logic in this way, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior.
