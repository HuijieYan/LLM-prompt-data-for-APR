### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is failing to handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is creating an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then attempting to create another IOLoop instance with the same parameter value, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when the current IOLoop instance already exists, even though it should not. This is likely due to the logic in the `initialize` function not correctly handling the scenario where a current IOLoop instance exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance again.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition inside the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance already exists. This correction aligns with the expected behavior of the function and resolves the issue described in the GitHub report.
