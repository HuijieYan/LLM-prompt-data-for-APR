### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance and ensure that only one current IOLoop exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug occurs when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` where the current IOLoop already exists, resulting in a RuntimeError.
   
2. The issue lies in the `initialize` function where the check for an existing current IOLoop is causing the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly.

3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current=True` for the initial IOLoop instance, tries to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` which should raise a RuntimeError due to an existing current IOLoop, and verifies that the current IOLoop remains unchanged after the failed construction.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where an existing current IOLoop is present and `make_current=True`.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `if` condition to check if the current IOLoop is not None when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised if there already exists a current IOLoop instance. This correction addresses the bug and satisfies the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue.
