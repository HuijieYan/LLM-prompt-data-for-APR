### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, and if so, it tries to create a new current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance is already present and raises a `RuntimeError` if that is the case.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file initializes an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and checks if the current instance is the same. It then tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.

### Error:
- The error occurs when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The `initialize` function expects that the current instance should be `None` when `make_current=True`, but in this case, it is already existing, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to detect the current instance correctly before raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the logic to check if the current instance is `not None` before raising an error while creating a new `IOLoop` instance, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
