### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is already available, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` uses `IOLoop(make_current=True)` to create an `IOLoop` instance where `make_current` is `True`, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The expected behavior is that a `RuntimeError` is raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when the current instance already exists.
4. The bug arises because the function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None`. It should only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. As a result, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should update the function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Otherwise, it should proceed without any error.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to this bug.
