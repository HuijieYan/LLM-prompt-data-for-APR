### Analyzing the buggy function and failing test

The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is designed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file specifically checks the behavior of setting `make_current` to `True`.

The failing test aims to ensure that `make_current=True` construction succeeds only once, and any subsequent attempt to create a current IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists," which indicates that the condition for checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance is not working as intended.

### Identifying potential error locations

The potential error locations in the `initialize` function include:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might not be correctly checking if a current IOLoop instance exists.
2. The flow of logic for handling the `make_current` parameter might be incorrect.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The bug occurs because the code is not properly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

The failing test wants to ensure that only one current IOLoop instance is created with the `make_current=True` flag, but due to the incorrect logic in the initialization function, the check for the existing IOLoop instance fails, leading to the RuntimeError.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, the function correctly checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, as indicated by the failing test. Otherwise, it should proceed with creating the IOLoop instance.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` is used to correctly check if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current=True`. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when one already exists.
