### Analysis:
1. The buggy function, `initialize(self, make_current=None)` in `ioloop.py`, is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The bug arises when `make_current` is set to `True` and the `IOLoop.current()` is not equal to `None`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks the behavior of creating an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then attempting to create another one with the same parameter.
   
3. The cause of the bug is that in the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the IOLoop already exists. This behavior conflicts with the test where it attempts to create a new instance with `make_current=True`.
   
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not `None`. In all other cases, including when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is `None`, there should be no exception raised.
   

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version above, the logic for raising a `RuntimeError` is adjusted to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when `make_current=True`, instead of when it is `None`. This change allows the test to pass as expected.
