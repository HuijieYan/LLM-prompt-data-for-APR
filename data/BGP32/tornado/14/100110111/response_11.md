### Analysis:
1. **Bug in the code**: The issue arises due to the logic in the `initialize` method where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` while `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. **Error Location**: The bug is within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.
3. **Cause of the Bug**: The bug occurs because the logic to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists is flawed. The intention of the code seems to be preventing the creation of multiple `IOLoop` instances with `make_current=True` by checking if an existing instance is already present. However, the logic is incorrect, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.
4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - Check if the logic within the `initialize` method correctly handles the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   - Ensure that the correct condition is checked to prevent the creation of multiple instances with `make_current=True`.
   - Modify the logic to handle the scenario appropriately without raising erroneous errors.
5. **Correction**:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditional check to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the corrected version addresses the logic flaw in the `initialize` method. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.
