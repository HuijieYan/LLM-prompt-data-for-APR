### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is attempting to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it either creates one or raises an error based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to test the behavior of creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempting to create another one with the same parameter, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing occurs because even though the first `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, the subsequent check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not properly considering the current state, leading to the error message raising prematurely.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` logic checks the existing `IOLoop` instances correctly and raises the error if there is already an existing instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the conditional statement to properly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.
- Only raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a duplicate `IOLoop` instance with the `make_current=True` parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function ensures that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is done correctly, avoiding the premature raising of the error message.
