### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks whether an IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another one with the same setting. The expected behavior is for the second creation to raise a `RuntimeError` since an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error message clearly indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised because the current IOLoop instance already exists when attempting to create a new one.
4. The strategy for fixing this bug would involve checking the condition for the existing instance more accurately and handling the `RuntimeError` case appropriately.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check for the current IOLoop instance is correct and that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if `current_instance` is not `None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an IOLoop instance already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
