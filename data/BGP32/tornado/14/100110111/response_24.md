### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an IOLoop instance with the option to specify whether to make it the current IOLoop instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to test the behavior of forcing the current IOLoop instance to be the newly created IOLoop instance.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised even though the current IOLoop instance is `None`.
4. The expected behavior is that the new IOLoop instance should become the current one when `make_current=True` is passed.
5. The GitHub issue mentions confusion about the conditional check raising an error when the current IOLoop instance is None.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function because the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` incorrectly raises a RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop instance is None. This causes the test to fail.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check logic to accurately handle the situation where the current IOLoop instance is None.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, the logic will correctly make the new IOLoop instance the current one when necessary. This correction should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
