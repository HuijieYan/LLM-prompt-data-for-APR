### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` is responsible for ensuring the current IOLoop instance exists correctly before setting it as the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and check if the current instance remains unchanged after trying to create a new one with the same parameter.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. It incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` without checking if an instance already exists before trying to create a new one.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize()` function to first check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`. Only raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists, otherwise, proceed with creating a new one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize()` function as shown above, we ensure that when `make_current=True`, a `RuntimeError` is only raised if an IOLoop instance already exists. This updated logic aligns with the expectations of the failing test and resolves the reported GitHub issue.
