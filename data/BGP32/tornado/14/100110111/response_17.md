### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class receives a parameter `make_current`, which is checked to determine if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does not exist and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, indicating that an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another one with the same parameter, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The error message shows that the `RuntimeError` is indeed being raised in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior.
4. The bug is likely due to incorrect logic in the conditional statement that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raises the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conditional statement that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary. This can be achieved by checking if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- Ensure that the `initialize` function correctly handles the case where `make_current` is `True` but an `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: check if an instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the suggested changes above, the corrected function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case.
