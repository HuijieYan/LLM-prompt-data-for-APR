### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance with an option to force it as the current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to become the current instance. It then attempts to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when the current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True` is passed, the code mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` even though it should be allowed to proceed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to allow creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` even if the current IOLoop already exists.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current instance.
