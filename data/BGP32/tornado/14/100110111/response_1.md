### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` initializes the IOLoop object.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` tests the behavior when trying to create a new IOLoop object with `make_current=True` when an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error occurs when the IOLoop instance already exists, but the function tries to create a new one, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.
4. The expected behavior is that if an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True` is specified, a `RuntimeError` should be raised, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
5. The GitHub issue suggests confusion about the logic and the error message in this scenario.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the case when an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True` is specified. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the function should return without attempting to create a new instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
