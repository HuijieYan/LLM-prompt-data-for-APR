1. Analysis:
   - The provided buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize an IOLoop object. The function takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which is either `None` or a boolean value. If `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, it sets the current instance to the newly created one. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   - The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` constructs an IOLoop object with `make_current=True` and then tries to construct another one with the same option, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
   - The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when it shouldn't, suggesting that the condition check for an existing current IOLoop is incorrect.

2. Error Location:
   - The error seems to be in the condition check for an existing current IOLoop instance in the `initialize` function.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The condition check for an existing IOLoop instance is not correctly handling the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`.
   - The `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't, leading to the failing test asserting for an exception that should not occur.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - To fix the bug, the condition check for the existing current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True` needs to be adjusted. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is no current instance and `make_current` is `True`.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition and properly handling the check for the existing IOLoop instance, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
