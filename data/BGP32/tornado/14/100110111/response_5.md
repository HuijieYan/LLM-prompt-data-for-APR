### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` checks if a current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to create a new one with the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` tests the behavior when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not do so based on the test.
4. The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, the function should not raise an error, but continue using the existing instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function. It is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, which goes against the expected behavior specified in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance does not exist. If an instance already exists, it should simply continue using that instance without raising an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected `initialize` function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # Raise a RuntimeError only if the current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the function should now pass the failing test case and behave as expected based on the provided input/output values.
