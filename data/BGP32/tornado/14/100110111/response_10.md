### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The function is checking if an IOLoop instance already exists using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method. If an instance does not exist, it tries to create one based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to test the functionality of forcing the creation of the current IOLoop instance. It expects that attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should result in a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
4. The error occurs because the function does not correctly handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True`.
5. The expected behavior should be to raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` if an instance already exists.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and an instance already exists. It should raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario but is not doing so. The failing test `test_force_current` specifically targets this scenario by attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` while an instance already exists. The incorrect behavior results in the `RuntimeError` not being raised, leading to the test failure.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and an instance already exists. This modification should ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised in this specific scenario.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check if an instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
