### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The buggy code checks if `make_current` is `True`, and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The error message during the failing test indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised to only do so when there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True` before setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for an existing current IOLoop
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly check for the presence of an existing current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True` and only raise a `RuntimeError` if no current instance exists.
