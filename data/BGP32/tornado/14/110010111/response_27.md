### Analysis:
1. Buggy function: `initialize`
2. Buggy class: `IOLoop`
3. Corresponding error message: `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`
4. Expected input/output:
   - Case 1: make_current = `True`
5. GitHub issue: The issue questions the logic on line 252 in `ioloop.py` where it checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`, then raises an error stating it already exists.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The current logic is intended to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, but the code still raises an error stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists even if it does not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function. The `make_current` parameter should be used to determine if a new `IOLoop` instance needs to be set as the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should only set the current instance if it does not already exist. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the modification above, the corrected version of the function ensures that the error "current IOLoop already exists" is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance is already present and `make_current` is set to `True`. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
