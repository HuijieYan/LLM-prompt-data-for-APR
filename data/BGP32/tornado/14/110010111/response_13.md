### Analyzing the buggy function:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
   
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `True` or `None` and then based on the condition, either makes the current IOLoop instance or raises a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop instance already exists.
   
3. The failing test is triggered when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and the function incorrectly raises an error stating that a current IOLoop already exists.

### Error cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the condition check for `make_current` being `True`. The function incorrectly checks if a current IOLoop instance is `None`, and if not, it raises an error even when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for when `make_current` is `True` to correctly handle the case when a current IOLoop instance exists. We should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing IOLoop instance.

### Corrected function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Adjusted condition for correctness
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the function only raises an error if there is an existing IOLoop instance and `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
