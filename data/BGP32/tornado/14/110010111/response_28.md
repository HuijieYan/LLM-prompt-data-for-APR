### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the code is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when attempting to set the current `IOLoop`.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that there may be a discrepancy in the logic at line 252 of the `ioloop.py` file regarding the check for the current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic handling in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code should check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` before attempting to set it as the current instance. However, the check is flawed, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set the current instance. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing this correction, the `initialize` function should now handle the setting of the current `IOLoop` instance correctly and prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised erroneously.
