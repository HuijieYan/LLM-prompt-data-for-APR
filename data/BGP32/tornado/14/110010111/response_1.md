### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is a current instance, and if not, it makes itself the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance, and if yes, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it fails with a `RuntimeError` indicating "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The issue seems to be related to how the existing `IOLoop` instance is handled when creating a new one with `make_current=True`. The code does not properly distinguish between the cases when there is no current instance and when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
4. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where a new `IOLoop` instance needs to be made the current one.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check the combination of the `make_current` flag and the presence of a current instance in a more precise manner.
2. If `make_current` is `None`, only set the instance as the current one if there is no current instance.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, raise a `RuntimeError` only if there is already a current instance.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the cases of setting the current `IOLoop` instance appropriately based on the `make_current` flag.
