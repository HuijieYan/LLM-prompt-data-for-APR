### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class is the `initialize` method.
2. The error occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, leading to a `RuntimeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. The check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance should be done before attempting to make the `IOLoop` current.
4. To fix the bug, we need to reorganize the logic in the `initialize` method to first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the `IOLoop` current.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By rearranging the logic to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it current, the function will now behave correctly and pass the failing test case provided.
