### Analysis:
1. The provided `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to ensure that a current `IOLoop` instance is set, based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is `True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.
3. The error message clearly states that when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
4. The issue is related to ensuring that only one `IOLoop` instance can be set as the current instance at a time.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance, the function incorrectly tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance again, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function. Specifically,
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should not attempt to make it current again.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it should proceed to make the current `IOLoop` instance.
- If `make_current` is `False`, it should not try to become the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and prevent the error raised in the failing test case.
