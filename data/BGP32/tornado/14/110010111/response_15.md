### Analyzing the buggy function

1. **Buggy Function Relationship**: The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is a method inside the `IOLoop` class. It is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance with a specific configuration, particularly regarding whether it should become the current `IOLoop`.

2. **Error Message**: The failing test indicates an issue with the scenario where `make_current=True`. It triggers a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

3. **Expected Input/Output**:
   - Input: `make_current=True`
   - Expected Output: If there is already a current `IOLoop`, raise `RuntimeError`. If not, set the current `IOLoop` to the current instance.

4. **GitHub Issue**:
   - **Issue Description**: The issue questions the logic behind line 252 where it checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`. It raises a concern about the subsequent check for the existence of a current `IOLoop`.
   
### Identifying Potential Error Locations

1. The condition where `make_current=True` triggers the `RuntimeError`.
2. The handling of the current `IOLoop` instance might be incorrect.
   
### Cause of the Bug

The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function does not check the current `IOLoop` instance correctly before setting it as the current instance. When `make_current=True`, it tries to set the current `IOLoop` without adequately verifying if there is already a current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set the current instance. If the current instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.
   
### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic as shown above, we ensure that the function correctly handles the scenario where `make_current=True`. It checks if a current instance already exists before attempting to set the current `IOLoop`. This fix should resolve the `RuntimeError` reported in the failing test.
