### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists before making it current.
2. The function is designed to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error occurs because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if a current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, it incorrectly raises an error stating that the current IOLoop already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for raising the error to match the expected behavior based on the function's intention.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` in the `initialize` function to only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
