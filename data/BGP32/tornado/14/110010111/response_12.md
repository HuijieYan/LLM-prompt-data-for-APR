### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function inside the `IOLoop` class has a bug that checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then tries to make the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is set to `True` but there is already a current `IOLoop`, it raises a `RuntimeError` suggesting that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug is located in the logic that checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug in this function arises from a misinterpretation or wrong condition logic. The function is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it should set the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance only if it already exists. The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, resulting in the `RuntimeError`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Modify the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario based on the value of `make_current`. Specifically:
     - If `make_current` is `None`, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't exist.
     - If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and should set the current `IOLoop` instance if it already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the logic properly handles the scenarios where `make_current` is `None` or `True`, setting the current `IOLoop` instance according to the conditions specified.
