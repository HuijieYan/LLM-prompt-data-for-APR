### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and tries to make the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`.
   
2. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when trying to make the current IOLoop when it already exists, which is contradictory.
   
### Identified Issue:
The issue arises because the existing logic in the `initialize` function incorrectly raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only attempt to make the IOLoop instance current if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `False`, it should not try to make the IOLoop current.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function.

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle the scenario where the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, preventing the unnecessary `RuntimeError` from being raised.
