### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the loop and handle the logic for making the current loop instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, indicating that the function should make the loop current. However, the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect because it should check whether a current loop instance already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the conditional check is incorrect, leading to the "current IOLoop already exists" error even if no current loop instance is present.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking logic to correctly detect whether a current loop instance exists before trying to make the loop current.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None`, we ensure that the error is only raised when a current loop instance exists, as intended. This modification will resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
