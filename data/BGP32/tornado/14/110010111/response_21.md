### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current instance and makes the current instance if not. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current instance and raise an error if one already exists.
  
2. The error occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises an error even if there is no current instance.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the condition check for `make_current`. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Fix:
In the buggy function, the condition for checking if a current instance exists is not correct. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance. We need to adjust the logic to reflect this.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing class code here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `initialize` function to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the error is only raised if there is actually a current `IOLoop` instance.
