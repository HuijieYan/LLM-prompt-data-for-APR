### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function and class relationship**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class manages setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The function takes an optional parameter `make_current` to control whether the current `IOLoop` should be set.
   
2. **Error in the function**: The error is occurring when `make_current` is set to `True`, and it attempts to make the current `IOLoop` instance, but it is already set. This results in raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

3. **Cause of the bug**:
   - The bug arises because the conditional check for `make_current` being `True` does not properly handle the scenario where the current `IOLoop` already exists. The code incorrectly assumes that if `make_current` is `True`, it should always make the current `IOLoop` without checking if it already exists.

4. **Strategy for fixing the bug**:
   - Before setting the current `IOLoop` instance, we should first check if it already exists. If it does, raise an exception. This will ensure that we only set the `IOLoop` instance if it is not already set.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check in the `initialize` function to verify if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to set it, we can prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised in the case where the current instance is already set.
