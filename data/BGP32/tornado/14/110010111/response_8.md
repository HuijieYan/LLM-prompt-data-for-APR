## Fixing the bug

The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class within the `tornado` package. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing. This leads to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance. We should only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, if `make_current` is `None`, we should set the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the function will correctly handle the case when a new `IOLoop` instance is being initialized with `make_current=True` and an existing current instance is present.

This correction ensures that the function behaves as expected based on the provided input parameters and resolves the issue mentioned on GitHub.
