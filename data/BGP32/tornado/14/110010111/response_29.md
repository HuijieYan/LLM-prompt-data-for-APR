### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists."
2. The failing test in the `IOLoop` class is trying to create a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, but it is detecting an existing current instance, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic to handle the case when a current instance already exists with `make_current=True` is incorrect in the `initialize` function. It should not raise an error in that scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if it does not exist, without raising an error if `make_current=True` and a current instance is already present.

### Correction

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current and current_instance is not None:
        # Do nothing if make_current=True and a current instance already exists
        pass
```

With this correction, the function will set the current instance only if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance does not exist. It will not raise an error if `make_current=True` and an instance is already present, satisfying the expected behavior.
