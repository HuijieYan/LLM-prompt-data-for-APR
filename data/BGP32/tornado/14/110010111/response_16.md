### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether an instance of `IOLoop` currently exists and behaves based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function raises a `RuntimeError` even though `IOLoop.current` is not `None`.
3. This behavior goes against the expected logic where a `RuntimeError` should only be raised if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the `if` conditions are evaluated and the logic around handling the existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug lies in the `initialize` function's conditions checking for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance. The issue is likely with the logic flow when handling the case where `make_current` is `True`.

### Proposed Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `if` conditions to correctly check for the presence of an existing `IOLoop` instance and handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. Adjust the conditional statements to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test case.
