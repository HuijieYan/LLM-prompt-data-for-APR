### Analyzing the buggy function:

1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the parameter `make_current` is `True` and if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If there is, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists."

2. The error message from the failing test indicates that when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter to the `IOLoop` constructor, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it detects that a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Identified potential error locations:

1. The bug seems to be triggered when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, but the function logic tries to make the current instance again.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might be incorrect, leading to the incorrect trigger of the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the bug:

The cause of the bug lies in the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, due to a flawed condition check, the `RuntimeError` is raised even without an existing current instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition checks as shown above, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This correction should address the bug and allow the function to behave as expected.
