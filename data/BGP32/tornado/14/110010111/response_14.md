### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` checks if the `make_current` argument is `True`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is being raised.
3. This bug is caused by the misunderstanding or incorrect implementation of the logic related to the current `IOLoop` instance check.
4. To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles the situation when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
We need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is `True` and if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not raise an error. Instead, it should simply make the current instance. This can be achieved by removing the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` check from the `make_current` block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()  # Make the current instance without raising an error
``` 

By making this modification, the corrected logic will handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists without raising a `RuntimeError`.
