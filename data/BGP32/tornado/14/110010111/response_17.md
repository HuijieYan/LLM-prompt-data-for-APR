### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function inside the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, with an option to make it the current instance if needed.
   
2. **Error**: The failing test indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when trying to make the current IOLoop instance even though it seems to already exist.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs due to the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance but fails to handle the case where a new instance should be created if it doesn't exist.
   - The logic for determining whether to make the IOLoop instance current is flawed, leading to the incorrect raising of `RuntimeError`.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - The fix involves modifying the logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that if `make_current=True`, a new IOLoop instance is created if no current instance exists.
   - Check if `make_current=True`, but no current instance exists, then proceed to make the current, otherwise create a new instance and make it the current one.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By incorporating the changes outlined above, the corrected function will appropriately check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter and handle the scenario where a new instance should be created.
