### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, with a parameter `make_current` to control whether the new IOLoop instance should become the current instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. It should be checking if the current IOLoop exists or not, but the current code checks if it is `None`, leading to the bug.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to properly check if the current IOLoop instance already exists when trying to make the new instance the current one.

### Suggested Fix:
Update the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`. If the current instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
