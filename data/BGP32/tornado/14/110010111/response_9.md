### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then based on the value of `make_current`, it either sets the current instance or raises an error.
2. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, contradicting the logic in the function.
3. From the code and error message, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists, the function should not raise an error.
4. To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `if` condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from an incorrect condition check related to the current state of the `IOLoop` instance. The function should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True`, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, the current implementation is raising an error even when a current instance exists. This discrepancy leads to the bug.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance should be adjusted based on the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, the function should not raise an error. The logic should be refined to handle this scenario correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                return  # No need to proceed if current instance already exists
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition check for `make_current` has been fixed. If `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists, the function simply returns without raising an error.
