### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks for the value of the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it makes the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, then it verifies if the current instance is not `None` and then tries to make the current instance.
   
2. **Error Locations:** Potential error locations in the function could be in the conditional statements where it checks the current `IOLoop` instance and decides whether to make it current.

3. **Cause of the Bug:** The bug may be occurring because of the incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` parameter. It checks for the existence of the current instance but does not handle the case where the instance already exists properly when `make_current=True`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:** To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where the current instance already exists correctly when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance in a variable `current_instance` to avoid repeated calls. Then, we adjust the logic to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current instance already exists. This should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
