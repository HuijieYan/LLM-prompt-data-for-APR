## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class

The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance, and if not, it sets the current instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it also checks if there is already a current instance, and if not, it sets the current instance.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The logic for handling the case when `make_current` is `True` is incorrect as it should only raise an error if there is already a current instance, not when it is `None`.
2. The logic for handling the case when `make_current` is `None` could potentially lead to unexpected behavior as it is not explicitly setting the current instance in that case.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The current logic raises an error when `make_current` is `True` regardless of whether there is a current instance or not, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

1. Check if `make_current` is `True`, set the current instance only if there is no current instance already.
2. Check if `make_current` is `None`, always set the current instance in this case.

## Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
