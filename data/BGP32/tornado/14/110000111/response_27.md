### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, it tries to make itself the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - Incorrect check for `make_current is None` instead of `make_current is False` to determine default behavior.
   - Incorrect check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
   - Inconsistent handling of the `make_current` parameter.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the function `initialize` arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it tries to make itself the current `IOLoop` instance without checking if there is already a current instance present. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly when trying to make the `IOLoop` current.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Change the condition `make_current is None` to `make_current is False` to represent the default behavior correctly.
2. Ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, only attempt to make the `IOLoop` the current instance if there is no current instance already present.
3. Handle the case where `make_current` is `False` separately to prevent conflicts with existing instances.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Changed the condition to check make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:  # Added handling when make_current is False
            pass
``` 

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current instance exists and raises an error only if one is already present. It also adds a placeholder for handling the case when `make_current` is `False` if necessary.
