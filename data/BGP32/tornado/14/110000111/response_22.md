### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The potential error lies in the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and setting it as the current one if `make_current` is true.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` but the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` separately before setting it as the current instance.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class code here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                
            self.make_current()
```

By checking the `current_ioloop` instance separately for `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we can avoid raising a `RuntimeError` incorrectly.
