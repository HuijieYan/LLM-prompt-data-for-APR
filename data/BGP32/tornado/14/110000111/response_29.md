### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, it calls the `make_current` method.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does not exist, otherwise it calls the `make_current` method.
3. However, the bug occurs because in the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, it checks for the current instance without considering the value of `make_current`. This leads to inconsistent checks and the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is due to incorrect condition checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked unconditionally, leading to the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance should be based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, then the check for the current instance should be performed and the `RuntimeError` should only be raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.

### Corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is modified to consider the value of the `make_current` parameter correctly. Now, the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.
