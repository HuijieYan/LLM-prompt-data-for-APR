### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True`, it tries to make the current `IOLoop` the instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop`, and if not, it makes the current `IOLoop` the instance.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from a logical issue in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying the "current IOLoop already exists", which is contradictory.

The incorrect logic in the buggy function is checking for `None` when it should actually be checking for the opposite condition. The intention is to raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists, but the code is doing the opposite check.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where `make_current` is `True` to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` and then raise an error if it already exists.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other methods and class properties...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
