The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function is intended to set the current instance of the `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and if there is no existing current instance. However, due to the faulty logic in the function, the RuntimeError is erroneously raised even when `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current instance.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no existing current instance.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and an existing current instance of `IOLoop` is detected. Otherwise, it sets the current instance appropriately. This fix addresses the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the condition for raising the error is correctly checked.
