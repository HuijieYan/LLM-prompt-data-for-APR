### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to check whether the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing or not, based on the provided `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if an `IOLoop` instance doesn't exist, it both raises an error ("current IOLoop already exists") and then tries to set the current `IOLoop`, which is contradictory.

### Identified Error:
The error lies in the logic of the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, and if the current `IOLoop` doesn't exist, it should only set the current `IOLoop` without raising an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to differentiate between setting the current `IOLoop` and raising an error. When `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists, it should set the current `IOLoop` without raising an error. If an instance already exists, the error should be raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
