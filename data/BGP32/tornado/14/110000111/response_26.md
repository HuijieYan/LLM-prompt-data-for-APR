## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, making it the current instance if specified by the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the `IOLoop` already has a current instance. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out the inconsistency in the behavior of the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly handles the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If that is the case, do not raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Update the logic to only make the `IOLoop` instance the current one if explicitly requested by the `make_current` parameter.

## Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
        # Commented out the RuntimeError to prevent unnecessary exception
        # else:
        #     raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

The corrected function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The issue mentioned on GitHub should be resolved with this fix.
