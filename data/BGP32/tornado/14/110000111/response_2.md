## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then sets it as the current instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` but the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist (evaluating to `None`). In this case, a `RuntimeError` is raised stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is incorrect behavior.
3. The bug occurs because the logic is incorrect in checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting it as the current instance when `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to check if the current instance already exists before trying to set it as the current instance, and only raise an error if there is a clash between the existing instance and the desired current setup.

## The corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class definitions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function first checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. It then properly handles the cases where `make_current` is `True`, `False`, or `None`. This fix ensures that the current instance handling is done correctly without raising erroneous errors.
