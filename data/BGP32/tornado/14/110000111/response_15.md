### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is used to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current instance current, but it is also trying to make it current when `make_current` is `None`.
2. The potential error location is the `if make_current is None` condition and the subsequent check for the current `IOLoop`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `None`, it is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then trying to make it current. This could lead to inconsistent behavior if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the current `IOLoop` instance is not set to current when `make_current` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
        import errno
        import functools
        import tornado.ioloop
        import socket
    
        def connection_ready(sock, fd, events):
            while True:
                try:
                    connection, address = sock.accept()
                except socket.error as e:
                    if e.args[0] not in (errno.EWOULDBLOCK, errno.EAGAIN):
                        raise
                    return
                connection.setblocking(0)
                handle_connection(connection, address)
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)
    
            io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
            callback = functools.partial(connection_ready, sock)
            io_loop.add_handler(sock.fileno(), callback, io_loop.READ)
            io_loop.start()
    
    .. testoutput::
       :hide:
    
    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `if make_current is None` block has been removed, and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is only done when `make_current` is `True`. This ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is not set to current when `make_current` is `None`.
