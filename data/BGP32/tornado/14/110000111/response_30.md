## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is expected to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, in which case it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if it exists.
4. The bug seems to be with the logic in handling the `make_current` parameter.

## Error Location
The bug is likely in the logic that handles the `make_current` parameter, causing the function to incorrectly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

## Cause of the Bug
When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if it exists. However, the current implementation is raising an error if there is no current instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
