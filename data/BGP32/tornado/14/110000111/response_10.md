### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`.
2. The bug seems to be related to the condition check for `make_current` and the handling of the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug causes an incorrect RuntimeError to be raised when `make_current` is set to `True` but the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checking and the logic for setting the current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Explanation
The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, then sets the current `IOLoop`. However, if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it raises a RuntimeError even when `make_current` is `True`, causing confusion.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
1. Modify the condition check to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. Change the logic to set the current `IOLoop` only when required conditions are met.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:  # Check if 'IOLoop' instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `IOLoop` instance is only set as the current instance when necessary conditions are met, avoiding the unnecessary RuntimeError.
