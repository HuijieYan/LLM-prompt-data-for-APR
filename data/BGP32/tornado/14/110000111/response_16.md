### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if `make_current` is `None`, then it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and makes the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and raises an error if it is not `None`.
2. The issue on GitHub indicates a confusion in understanding why the code raises an error when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None`. This suggests a possible inconsistency or confusion in the code logic.

### Potential error location:
The issue may lie in the logic where the `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the inconsistent handling of `make_current` being `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance not being `None`. This inconsistency can lead to confusion as observed in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` properly. This may involve removing the check that raises `RuntimeError` when the current instance is not `None`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                pass  # No need to raise an error if make_current is True and current instance exists
``` 

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` exists, the function will proceed without raising a `RuntimeError`. This change ensures a consistent behavior with the expected logic.
