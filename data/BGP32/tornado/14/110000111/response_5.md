### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a bug where it incorrectly checks for the existence of the current instance of `IOLoop` and raises an error if it exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
   
2. **Error**: The bug occurs because the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is flawed, leading to raising an error even when the instance does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. 
2. Ensure that the current instance check is accurate before making the new instance the current one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class addresses the bug by properly checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` before raising an error or making the new instance the current one.
