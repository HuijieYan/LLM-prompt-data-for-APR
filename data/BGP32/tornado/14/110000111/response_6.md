### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the case where `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is also `None`, then calling `self.make_current()`. But in the `elif` block, it checks `make_current` again and if `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
2. The bug arises from not correctly handling the condition where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, instead of doing it unconditionally.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to raise `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_io_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_io_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
