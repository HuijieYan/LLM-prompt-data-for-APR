## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue where it checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and tries to set it as current again based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the code still tries to set it as current, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is present is incorrect. It should not attempt to set the current instance if it already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to only set the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and no current instance exists. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is not None:
            if current_instance is not None and make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            if make_current:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
```
