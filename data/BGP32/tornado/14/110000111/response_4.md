### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks the `make_current` parameter and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it doesn't exist, it tries to make the current instance.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic where it checks if the current instance exists even when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the logic where the `make_current` parameter is checked.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is set to `True`, it should simply make the current instance without checking if it already exists. The conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should not be performed when `make_current` is `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the code to remove the unnecessary check for the current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. Simplify the logic to accurately handle the different scenarios based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
        # Remove the check for current instance as it is redundant when make_current is True
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By implementing this correction, the issue should be resolved and the correct behavior should be achieved based on the expected input/output values and the GitHub issue description.
