### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `True`, but in `if make_current` statement, it also checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which contradicts the intention of making the current `IOLoop`.
2. The issue on GitHub indicates confusion regarding the behavior of the `IOLoop.current` method when `instance=False`. It questions why the "already exists" error is raised if the current `IOLoop` is `None`.
   
### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't already exist, instead of raising an error when the instance is `None`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If the instance does not exist, it should simply create one.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
