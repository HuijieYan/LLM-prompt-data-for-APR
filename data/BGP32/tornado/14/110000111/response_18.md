## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then tries to make it current again. This can lead to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` being raised even when the loop does not exist.
2. The buggy function takes a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean indicating whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be made current or not.
3. The issue on GitHub points out that the logic at line 252 is incorrect as it assumes that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it raises an error saying "already exists", which is contradictory.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is made current only if it doesn't already exist.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to change the logic to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is made current only if it doesn't exist. We can simplify the logic to remove redundant checks and ensure consistency in handling the `make_current` parameter.

## Code Correction
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The corrected version of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections, the `initialize` function now checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not before attempting to make it current again. This ensures that the logic is consistent and the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.
