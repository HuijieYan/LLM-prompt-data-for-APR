### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking the current instance of `IOLoop` and trying to make it the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, otherwise it should make itself the current instance.

### Error Location
The error is occurring in the condition when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. The `RuntimeError` is being raised even though there is no current instance present.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. The condition is raising a `RuntimeError` even when there is no existing current `IOLoop` instance due to a missing check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance present.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
