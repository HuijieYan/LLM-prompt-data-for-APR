### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`. It checks if there is already a current instance and either sets the current instance or raises an error.
2. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion about the logic of line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is being checked for `None`.
3. The bug seems to be that the condition on line 252 is not correct, leading to unexpected behavior when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug
The bug lies in the condition at line 252:
```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
```
This condition should not raise an error when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` because the intention is to create a new instance in that case. The error should only be raised when there is an existing current instance and `make_current=True`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to handle the cases correctly. We need to check if `make_current` is `True` and whether an instance already exists. If an instance does not exist, we should go ahead and make the current instance. If an instance already exists, and `make_current` is set to `True`, then we should raise the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other code from the class remains unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```
