### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and makes the current instance if not exist.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks for an existing current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if it already exists.
4. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the check for an existing current instance is incorrect as it should not raise an error in this case.

### Error Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises an error if an instance already exists, which is inconsistent with the intended behavior of attempting to make the current instance.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check when `make_current` is `True` to simply make the current `IOLoop` instance if it is not `None` instead of raising an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class details...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated this condition to proceed if current IOLoop exists
                self.make_current()
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, it will try to make the current `IOLoop` instance if it exists, without raising an error. This fixes the inconsistency in the original function's behavior.
