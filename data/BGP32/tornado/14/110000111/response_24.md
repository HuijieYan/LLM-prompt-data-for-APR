### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is `True`, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior might be causing confusion based on the GitHub issue mentioned.
2. The issue seems to question why the `RuntimeError` is raised when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
3. The cause of the bug could be a misunderstanding of the logic in the `initialize` function with respect to the current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` function based on the intended behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that it only raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance accordingly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the function first checks if `make_current` is `True`. If it is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then sets the current instance accordingly.
