### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. However, the current implementation checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The bug occurs in the logic where it is checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and trying to make the current instance.
3. The bug is triggered by the logic within the `initialize` function which incorrectly handles the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. It mistakenly raises an error instead of setting the current instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current instance is correctly set if `make_current` is `True` regardless of the existence of an `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is True:
            if current_instance is not None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the correct behavior will be achieved. This change ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is set if `make_current` is `True` without raising an error unnecessarily.
