### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should only make the `IOLoop` current if there is no current instance already.
2. The issue on GitHub suggests that there might be a problem with how the `IOLoop.current` method is being used, leading to confusion about whether the current instance exists or not.

### Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, the condition for `make_current is None` is checking if there is no current instance and makes the `IOLoop` instance current. This condition might be incorrect.
2. The condition for `make_current` being `True` doesn't clearly check if the current instance already exists before raising an error.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug might arise due to a confusion in the logic of checking if the current instance exists. The current implementation tries to make the instance current if `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance. But the original intent might have been to only make the instance current if `make_current` is `True`. Additionally, the error message is raised too soon without accurately checking if the current instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to make the instance current only when `make_current` is explicitly `True`.
2. Check for the existence of the current instance in a clearer way before raising an error if `make_current` is `True`.
3. Ensure that the `initialize` function follows the expected behavior based on the provided cases and the issue description.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
