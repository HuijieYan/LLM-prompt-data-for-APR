## Analysis
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function has a conditional logic to initialize the current IOLoop based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and a current IOLoop already exists, causing a `RuntimeError`.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the conditional logic in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current IOLoop already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`, but it does not consider the case where `make_current` is `True` and no current IOLoop exists.

## Fix
To fix the bug:
- Update the conditional logic in the `initialize` method to also handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and no current IOLoop exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By checking if the current IOLoop is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we can avoid the `RuntimeError` when no current IOLoop exists.
