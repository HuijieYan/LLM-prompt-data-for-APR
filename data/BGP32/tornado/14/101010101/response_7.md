### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, and an IOLoop instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
4. The bug is caused by not properly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
5. The fix involves checking if an IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it current.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement for the case when `make_current` is `True`. We should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make it current.

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding a check to see if an IOLoop instance already exists in the `elif` block, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to make the current IOLoop when it already exists.
