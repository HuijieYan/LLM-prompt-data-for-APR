### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, sets the current instance using the `make_current` method. If a `make_current` argument is provided as `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The failing test indicates that the `make_current` argument is provided as `True`, which triggers the error because an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even though it is expected behavior when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance is already set.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check for `make_current` being `True` to skip raising the `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
5. We can update the `initialize` function to handle this case correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Skip raising the RuntimeError when an IOLoop instance already exists
            pass
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the conditional check as shown in the corrected version, the function will no longer raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test ensuring that the expected behavior is met.
