### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls the `make_current` method. If there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. The failing test case expects that when `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the code block where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected. However, the code is mistakenly written to call `self.make_current()` before raising the error, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the code should be modified so that it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The call to `self.make_current()` in this case is unnecessary.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
