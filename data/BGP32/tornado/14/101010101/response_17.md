## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop instance if one does not already exist; otherwise, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop instance already exists.
2. The error message shows that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is attempting to set the current IOLoop instance even if one already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists is inside the `elif make_current` block, which is incorrect. It should be part of the first condition where `make_current is None` to handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to move the check for an existing IOLoop instance to the outer `if` block, and only proceed with setting a new current instance if one does not exist.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
