### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, it calls `make_current()`. However, there is an issue with the logic of the condition checks and the error handling.
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is True, but the `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug occurs because the initial if condition is checking if a new `IOLoop` instance should be made, but it wrongly checks if an existing `IOLoop` instance is already present, causing a conflict in logic.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the logic to correctly check the existing `IOLoop` instance before trying to create a new one.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where an existing `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- Check for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance before trying to make a new one based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
