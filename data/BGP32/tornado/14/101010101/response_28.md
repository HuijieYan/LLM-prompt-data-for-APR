### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
3. The error message clearly states that a `RuntimeError` is raised when a current IOLoop already exists.
4. The buggy code checks if a current IOLoop already exists regardless of the value of `make_current`.
5. A strategy to fix the bug would be to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `elif make_current` to `elif make_current is True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. This correction should fix the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
