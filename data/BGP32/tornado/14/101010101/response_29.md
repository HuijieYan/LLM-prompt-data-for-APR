### Analysis
1. The function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop instance. It takes a parameter `make_current` which is expected to be a boolean indicating whether to force the initialization of the current IOLoop.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, and an IOLoop instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This is due to the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` being `False` when it should be `True`.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to change the condition in the elif statement `elif make_current` to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop. If an instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`. If an instance does not exist, then make the current IOLoop.
5. Fixing the bug in the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this correction, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` ensures that if an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, a `RuntimeError` will be raised. This fix should address the bug and pass the failing test.
