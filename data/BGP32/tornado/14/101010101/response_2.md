### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and it checks if the current IOLoop already exists before making the current IOLoop. If the condition is met, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect condition in the `elif make_current:` block. The check for the current IOLoop existence should be inverted to avoid raising an error when it exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `elif make_current:` block to only call `self.make_current()` when the current IOLoop does not exist.
  
### Fix
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition in the `elif make_current:` block, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current IOLoop already exists, as expected.
