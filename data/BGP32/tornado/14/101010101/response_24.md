## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is intended to set the current IOLoop instance. 
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic around checking if the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when attempting to set the IOLoop instance.
4. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, the function erroneously checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before setting it, which leads to the RuntimeError when it's not `None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for setting the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True` without unnecessary checks.

## Correction
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions omitted for clarity

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, the IOLoop instance is set without unnecessary checks for existence. Now, the corrected function should handle the case correctly without raising a RuntimeError.
