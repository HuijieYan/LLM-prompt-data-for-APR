### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop class with the option to force the creation of a new current instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if a current IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The buggy behavior is caused by the condition check in the `initialize` function, where it incorrectly raises an error if `make_current` is `True` without checking if a current instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks to ensure that the error is only raised when an IOLoop instance does not exist and `make_current` is `True`.

### Correction
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditional check for `make_current` to properly handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists, the bug in the `initialize` function is fixed. This correction ensures that the error is only raised when needed, allowing the function to behave as expected with the provided input.
