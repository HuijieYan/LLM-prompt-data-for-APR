### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object. It accepts a `make_current` parameter, which should be a boolean value.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`. In this case, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The bug is caused by not checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` before raising the error or calling `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to add a check to see if there is already a current `IOLoop` before either raising an error or calling `self.make_current()`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By adding a check to see if there is not a current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is set to `True`, we can prevent the function from raising a `RuntimeError` when unnecessary.
