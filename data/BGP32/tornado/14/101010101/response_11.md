### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an instance of the `IOLoop` class already exists before initializing a new instance.
2. The error message indicates that the code is trying to create a new instance of the `IOLoop` class with `make_current=True`, but there is already an existing instance.
3. The bug occurs because the conditional statement `if make_current is None` should be `if make_current is not None` to properly handle the case when `make_current=True`.
4. We need to modify the conditional statement to check if `make_current` is not None, and if there is an existing instance of `IOLoop`, raise an error.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is not None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
