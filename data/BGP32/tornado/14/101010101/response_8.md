1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop object. It accepts an optional `make_current` parameter, which is used to specify whether to make the current IOLoop object.
   - The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is attempting to create a new IOLoop object while another IOLoop object already exists.
   - The expected behavior is that when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop object already exists, it should not create a new one but should just switch the current IOLoop object.

2. **Potential Error**:
   - The issue seems to occur in the section where `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop object already exists.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - In the buggy function, the logic is checking if an IOLoop instance already exists, but it doesn't handle the situation properly when `make_current` is `True`.
   - The bug occurs because the function is raising an error when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, instead of just setting the current IOLoop.

4. **Strategy for Fixing**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. Instead of raising an error, it should just set the current IOLoop instance.

5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # Set the current IOLoop instance here instead of raising an error
                IOLoop.current(instance=False).make_current()
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop object already exists, the function will set the current IOLoop instance instead of raising an error.
