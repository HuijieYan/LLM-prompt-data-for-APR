### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the current IOLoop instance. It checks if a current instance of IOLoop exists and handles the case when `make_current` parameter is provided as `True`.
2. The error occurs when a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, causing a RuntimeError to be raised.
3. The bug is caused because the condition to check if a current IOLoop instance exists is incorrect. The current instance check should be inverted when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition to properly handle the case when `make_current` is provided as `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` in the section handling `make_current=True`, we can prevent the RuntimeError from being raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists.
