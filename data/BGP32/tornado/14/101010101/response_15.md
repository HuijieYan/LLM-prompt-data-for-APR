### Analysis
1. The buggy function, `initialize`, is designed to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class. The `make_current` parameter indicates whether the current IOLoop should be set as the current instance.
2. The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True`, and a current IOLoop already exists. This scenario results in a `RuntimeError` being raised.
3. The buggy function relies on the `IOLoop.current` function to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, the function should raise an error but currently does not handle this case properly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where a current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before setting a new one when `make_current` is `True`.
2. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By checking if a current instance already exists before setting a new one, we can prevent the `RuntimeError` when attempting to set a new current instance that already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.
