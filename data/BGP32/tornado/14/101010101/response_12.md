### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to set the current IOLoop instance or raise an error if one already exists.
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when a current IOLoop already exists.
3. The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is conflicting with the check for an existing current IOLoop instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition for checking the presence of a current IOLoop instance is correct and aligned with the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. It seems that the `elif make_current` condition is causing the issue. We should refactor the logic of the `if` statements to avoid this conflict.
2. Reorder the conditions to check for `make_current` first, then handle setting the current IOLoop or raising an error for an existing instance.
3. Update the logic to set the current IOLoop instance inside the conditional block for `make_current is None`, ensuring that it is only set when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is not None:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the updated `initialize` function should handle `make_current` correctly and resolve the issue with the conflicting conditions.
