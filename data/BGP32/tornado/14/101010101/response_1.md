### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop object by setting the current IOLoop if it doesn't exist already.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
3. The bug is caused by checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None` instead of checking if it already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where `make_current` is `True` to check if there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` within the `initialize` function when `make_current` is set to `True` to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists.
2. If the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is `True`, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
