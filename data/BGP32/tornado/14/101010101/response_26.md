The bug in the provided function is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if an IOLoop already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists. However, it should only raise an error if an IOLoop does not exist. This discrepancy causes the failing test as it expects an existing IOLoop but receives a `RuntimeError` instead.

To fix this bug, we should modify the condition for `make_current` to check if an IOLoop does not already exist before attempting to create a new one.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Changed the condition here
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter, ensuring that it only raises a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
