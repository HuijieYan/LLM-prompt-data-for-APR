The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument. The bug in this function is that it checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs when checking the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. The `current` function takes an `instance` argument, but the buggy function incorrectly passes `False` to it. The correct behavior should be to pass `True` to `instance`, indicating that we want the actual current instance of `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to pass `True` to the `instance` argument of `IOLoop.current()` when checking for the current instance. This way, the function will correctly determine the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function should now correctly check for the presence of the current `IOLoop` instance and initialize the instance accordingly.
