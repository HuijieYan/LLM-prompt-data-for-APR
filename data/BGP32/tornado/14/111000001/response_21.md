The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug causes an incorrect behavior when trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the condition where the current instance is checked for existence. The `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` condition is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the `current` function in the `IOLoop` class is called with `instance=False`, which returns `None` if there is no current instance. This condition should be checked with `True` instead of `False`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where we check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. We should modify the condition to check if the current instance is not `None` instead of checking if it is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `IOLoop` class will correctly handle the initialization based on the `make_current` argument.
