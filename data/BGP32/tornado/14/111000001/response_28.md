The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue in the condition check for `make_current`. The logic is incorrect in handling the `make_current` parameter. Here's an explanation of the bug:

1. The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` if it's not set already based on the `make_current` parameter passed to it.

2. In the buggy code, the condition `if make_current is None:` correctly checks if the parameter is None, and if so, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, then it sets the current instance using `self.make_current()`.

3. However, the problem arises in the `elif make_current:` condition. It checks if `make_current` is True, and if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, then it raises a `RuntimeError`. This logic is incorrect because it should only set the current instance if `make_current` is True, not raise an error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the three scenarios:
- If `make_current` is `None`, set the current instance if it doesn't exist.
- If `make_current` is `True`, set the current instance if it doesn't exist.
- If `make_current` is `False`, don't try to set the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        pass
```

This corrected version ensures that the condition for setting the current instance of `IOLoop` is handled correctly based on the `make_current` parameter passed to the `initialize` function.
