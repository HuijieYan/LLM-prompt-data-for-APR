Potential Error Locations:
1.`initialize(self, make_current=None)`: The logic inside the `initialize` method seems to be wrong. It's trying to handle the case where `make_current` parameter is `None` or `True`. However, the condition to check if `make_current` is `True` is not correct.
2. `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`: This condition may not be correct as it may not be checking the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the incorrect condition for checking if `make_current` is `True`. Additionally, the condition for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` in the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` may not provide the expected result.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the condition for checking if `make_current` is `True`.
2. Improve the condition for checking the current instance of `IOLoop`.

Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
