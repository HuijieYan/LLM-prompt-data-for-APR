## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current instance of the `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` argument. The function first checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it then calls `self.make_current()` to make the current instance. If `make_current` is True, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug:
The bug in the current implementation of the `initialize` function is in the handling of the `make_current=None` case. When `make_current` is `None`, it should only set the current instance of `IOLoop` if there is no current instance available. However, due to the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, it does not check for an existing current instance correctly and may set the current instance even if one already exists.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of a current instance when `make_current` is `None`. We should only set the current instance if there is no existing `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None` is used to correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `None`.
- The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is used to check if there is an existing current instance when `make_current` is `True`. 
- These modifications ensure that the `initialize` function only sets the current instance if necessary and avoids setting it multiple times or overriding an existing instance.
