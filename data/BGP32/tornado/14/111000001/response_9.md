The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` exists and whether `make_current` is set to `True`. If `make_current` is set to `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which is intended behavior. However, the bug lies in the part where it should have been checking if `make_current` is `False` instead of checking if `make_current` is `None`.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        pass
```

In this corrected version, it explicitly checks if `make_current` evaluates to `False` (since it can be explicitly set to `False`) and does not attempt to make the current `IOLoop` in that case. It also includes an `else` block to handle the case where `make_current` is neither `None` nor `True`.
