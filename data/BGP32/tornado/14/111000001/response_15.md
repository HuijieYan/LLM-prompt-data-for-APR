The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the incorrect usage of the `IOLoop.current` function. The function is being called with `instance=False`, but there is no `instance` parameter in the `current` function definition. This results in a `TypeError` being raised when the `initialize` function is executed.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the usage of the `IOLoop.current` function by removing the `instance` parameter when calling it.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `IOLoop.current` function is called without the `instance` parameter, which fixes the bug and ensures that the function executes correctly without any errors.
