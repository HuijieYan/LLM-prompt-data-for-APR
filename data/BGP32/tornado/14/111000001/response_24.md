The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` incorrectly. The `IOLoop.current` function is called with `instance=False`, which means it is checking for the current instance without creating a new one if none exists. However, the intended behavior is to check for the current instance and create a new one if none exists when `make_current` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `None`. We should call `IOLoop.current` with `instance=True` to ensure that a new instance is created if none exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly create a new instance of `IOLoop` if none exists when `make_current` is `None`.
