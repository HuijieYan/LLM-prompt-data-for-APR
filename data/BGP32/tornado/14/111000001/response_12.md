## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic used to determine whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs because the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is incorrect. The intention of the `initialize` function is to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and make the current instance if necessary. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is incorrect because the `current` function returns an `IOLoop` instance, not `None`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the logic of the condition to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
2. Use the `current` function correctly to get the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version of the initialize Function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- In the first `if` block, we check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not equal to `self`, meaning if there is no current instance, then we make the current instance.
- In the `elif` block, we check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not equal to `self`, and if it is not, we raise an error indicating that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
