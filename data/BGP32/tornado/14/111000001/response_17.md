Potential error locations within the `initialize` function:
1. Incorrect comparison of `make_current` with `None`.
2. Incorrect usage of the `IOLoop.current` function.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because of the incorrect comparison of `make_current` with `None`. The function `IOLoop.current` is called with the `instance=False` argument, which doesn't return the current `IOLoop` instance as intended.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the comparison of `make_current` with `None` to `make_current is None`.
2. Modify the call to `IOLoop.current` to not pass the `instance=False` argument.

Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the changes mentioned above, the bug in the `initialize` function should be fixed.
