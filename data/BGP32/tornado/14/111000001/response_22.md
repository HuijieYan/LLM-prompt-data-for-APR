## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` could be causing issues when checking for the current instance.
2. The conditional logic for setting the current `IOLoop` could lead to incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None before making the current `IOLoop`. This logic can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when trying to set the current `IOLoop`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to simplify the logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that the current `IOLoop` is set correctly without encountering any unexpected conditions.

## Corrected Version of the initialize function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance and store it in `current_instance`. Then, we adjust the conditional logic based on the value of `make_current` and the status of the current instance to determine whether to set the current `IOLoop` or raise an error.
