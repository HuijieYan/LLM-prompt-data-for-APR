Based on the provided code snippet, the buggy function is the `initialize` method inside the `IOLoop` class. The purpose of this method is to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class and make it the current `IOLoop` instance if needed.

The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the conditional checks for the `make_current` parameter. Here is the analysis and steps to fix the bug:

1. Analyze the buggy function:
   - The `initialize` function checks the value of the `make_current` parameter.
   - If `make_current` is None, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls the `make_current` method to make the current instance.
   - If `make_current` is True, it again checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises an error. Regardless, it calls the `make_current` method.

2. Identify potential error locations:
   - The bug occurs in the conditional check for `make_current`. The condition for checking if `make_current` is True is incorrect.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug arises from the incorrect conditional check for the `make_current` parameter. The current implementation incorrectly raises an error when `make_current` is True, without checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter. We should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for checking if a current `IOLoop` exists is modified in the `elif` block. Now, the error is only raised if `make_current` is True and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
