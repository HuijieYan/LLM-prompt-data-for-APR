The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The bug in this function lies in the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

Here are the issues and suggested fixes:

1. The `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. This call should be `IOLoop.current()` instead, as the `current` function is designed to return the current instance if it exists, not create a new one.
  
2. The condition `if make_current is None:` should be `if make_current is None or not make_current:` to cover the case where `make_current` is either None or False.

3. In the `elif` block, instead of raising `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`, it should raise `RuntimeError("Current IOLoop does not exist")` because the logic checks that the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or not make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the conditions and method calls in the `initialize` function, the bug should be resolved, and the function should work as intended.
