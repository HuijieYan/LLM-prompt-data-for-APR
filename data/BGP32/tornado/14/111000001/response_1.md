The bug in the provided function `initialize` lies in the conditional check for the `make_current` argument. The logic is incorrect and does not achieve the intended behavior properly. 

Here are the potential error locations:
1. In the if block for `make_current is None`, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` should be compared with `None` instead of calling it with `instance=False` argument.
2. The logic inside the `if` block for `make_current is None` is not clear and may lead to unexpected behavior.
3. The `elif` block for `make_current` check may also not behave as expected.

To fix this bug, we can update the function as follows:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- We check if `make_current` is `True` instead of just checking `truthiness`.
- We call `IOLoop.current()` without passing any arguments.
- We ensure that the `make_current` logic aligns with the intended behavior of the function. 

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected within the `IOLoop` class.
