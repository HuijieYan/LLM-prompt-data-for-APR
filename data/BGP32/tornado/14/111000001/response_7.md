## Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the `IOLoop` instance as the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True` or not set at all. However, there is a bug in the conditional statements of the function.

The bug arises from the condition `elif make_current:` in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then set the current instance. But the current implementation fails to check if the current instance already exists and directly calls `self.make_current()`.

As per the comments in the class docs, by default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior can be controlled with the `make_current` argument to the `IOLoop` constructor.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to modify the condition for `make_current` to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. The function should first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before making it the current instance.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, we store the current `IOLoop` instance in the `current_instance` variable and then check for the conditions appropriately before making it the current instance. This ensures that the function behaves as intended and fixes the bug.
