## Analysis:
- The buggy function `IOLoop.initialize()` is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance by making it the current `IOLoop` if needed.
- The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls `self.make_current()`.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises an error. Then it calls `self.make_current()`.

## Bug:
The bug in the `IOLoop.initialize()` function is that when `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, the condition is incorrect, and it checks for the absence of a current instance instead of its presence.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug in the `IOLoop.initialize()` function, we need to modify the condition for the case when `make_current` is `True` to check for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance instead of its absence.

## Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Check for the presence of a current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we modify the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` when `make_current` is `True` to correctly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` already exists.
