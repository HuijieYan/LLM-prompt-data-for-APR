The issue in the buggy function `initialize` arises from the incorrect usage of the `IOLoop.current` function. 

1. In the `initialize` function, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is being called to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance without creating one if it doesn't exist. This usage of `instance=False` is incorrect because the parameter `instance` of the `current` method is not defined.

2. The `current` method should be called without any parameter specifying `instance` to obtain the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, the `IOLoop.current()` method should be called without any parameters. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly check for the current `IOLoop` instance without any errors caused by incorrect parameters.
