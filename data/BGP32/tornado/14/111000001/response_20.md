The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance by making it the current instance if needed. However, there is a bug in the logic that prevents it from functioning correctly. 

The issue lies in the condition `if make_current is None:`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance that is not the current one or it calls `self.make_current()`. This logic is flawed as it should correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `None`. One approach is to check if there is no current instance and then call `self.make_current()`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is None
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            # If no current instance exists, make the current instance
            self.make_current()
    
    elif make_current:  # If make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error if current instance already exists
        self.make_current()
```

This modification ensures that if `make_current` is `None`, and there is no current instance, the `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one by calling `self.make_current()`.
