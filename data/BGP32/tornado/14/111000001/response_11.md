The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical error that can lead to unexpected behavior. 

The issue arises in the `if make_current is None` block where it checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and tries to make the current `IOLoop` if one doesn't exist. However, the condition inside this block also allows execution of the `make_current` method if `make_current` is set to `True`. This can lead to the `make_current` method being called twice when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument.

To fix this issue, the logic inside the `if make_current is None` block needs to be adjusted to only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or any other value, ensuring that the `make_current` method is only called once when needed.
