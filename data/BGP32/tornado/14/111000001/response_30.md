## Explanation of the bug:
The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` in the `IOLoop` class is used to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs in the condition where `make_current` is `None`. In this case, the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function. If there is no current instance, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the bug lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is incorrect.

The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function is meant to return the current `IOLoop` instance or create a new one if it doesn't exist, based on the `instance` parameter. Therefore, checking if it returns `None` is not the correct way to determine if there is a current instance.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `initialize` function to properly determine whether there is a current `IOLoop` instance or not. Instead of checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, we should modify it to check if the current instance exists based on the `instance` parameter.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
