The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. 

**Error Location**:
1. The `make_current` parameter is not being checked correctly in the `initialize` function. 
2. In the first `if` condition, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is being called without passing the `instance` parameter.

**Cause of the Bug**:
1. The bug occurs because the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class is being called without specifying the `instance` parameter, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The logic to handle the `make_current` parameter is incorrect and leads to unintended control flow.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
1. Correctly pass the `instance` parameter when calling the `current` function.
2. Modify the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the `make_current` function is called appropriately.

**Corrected Version**:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- When checking for the current instance, `IOLoop.current()` is called without the `instance` parameter.
- The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is modified to ensure that the `make_current` function is only called when necessary and that an error is raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current=True`.
