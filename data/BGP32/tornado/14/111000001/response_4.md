Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The check for `make_current is None` and calling `self.make_current()` seems unnecessary as `make_current` is None by default.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not be checking for the correct condition.

Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. The condition `if make_current is None` is redundant because `make_current` is already None by default. Additionally, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` may not properly validate if the current instance exists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the `make_current is None` condition as it is redundant.
2. Modify the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to implement a proper check for the existence of the current instance.

Corrected Version:
```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
