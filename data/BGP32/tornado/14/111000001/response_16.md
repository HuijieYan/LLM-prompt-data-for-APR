The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug related to the `make_current` argument handling. 

1. Potential error location: 
    - The bug occurs when checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not based on the `make_current` argument.

2. Cause of the bug: 
    - The bug lies in the logic of handling the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `None`, the code checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and makes the current instance if it is not present. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current instance already exists and raise an error if it does, but the logic is not implemented correctly.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
    - To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic used to handle the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `True`, check if the current instance already exists and raise an error if it does. If `make_current` is `None`, make the current instance only if it does not already exist.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is managed appropriately based on the provided argument.
