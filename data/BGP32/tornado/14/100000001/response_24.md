## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then decides whether to call the `make_current` method based on the `make_current` parameter passed. However, there are a few potential error locations in the code:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked multiple times, which can lead to inconsistent behavior.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is not properly structured.

## Explanation:
The bug in the buggy function occurs due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and makes it current. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises an error if it's not. This can result in unexpected behavior as the same check for the current instance is repeated.

## Fix:
1. Remove the redundant checks for the current `IOLoop` instance to avoid inconsistencies.
2. Refactor the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter properly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` to avoid multiple calls.
- We then properly handle the `make_current` parameter based on whether it's `None` or `True`, without redundant checks for the current instance.
