## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is meant to initialize a new IOLoop instance with an optional parameter `make_current`. The function checks if an IOLoop instance is already set as current, and if not, it calls the `make_current` method. However, there seems to be a logic error in the function that might cause unexpected behavior.

## Identified potential errors:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, but it should not execute the block unless `make_current` is `True`.
2. The `elif make_current` block assumes that if `make_current` is not `None`, it should be `True`, which can lead to possible incorrect behavior.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function incorrectly interprets `None` as requiring `make_current` to be executed. It fails to recognize the difference between `None` and `False` for the `make_current` parameter, leading to wrong behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. We should only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not already set.

## Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we check if `make_current` is `True`, and if so, we verify that the current IOLoop instance is not already set before calling `self.make_current()`. This logic should address the bug and prevent unexpected behavior.
