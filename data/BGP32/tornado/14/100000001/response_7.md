## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` has a logic error in the `if` condition where it checks for the value of `make_current`. Depending on the value of `make_current`, the function attempts to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. However, the logic is flawed, and it can lead to incorrect behavior.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `make_current is None` may lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The condition `make_current` does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is not `True`.
3. The comparison with `None` may not work as expected.

## Explanation of Bug:
The bug in the original function arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The logic is not handling all possible cases of `make_current` correctly, leading to potential errors in the function's execution. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance is current, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is `False`, it does not handle this case properly, leading to potential issues.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to refine the logic of handling the `make_current` parameter. We should ensure that all possible cases of `make_current` are correctly handled, including the case where it is `False`. Additionally, we should review the comparisons against `None` for correctness.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we added an `elif` clause to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`. Additionally, we made sure to check for `is None` and `is not None` where necessary for proper comparison. This updated version should now handle all cases of `make_current` correctly and address the previously identified bug.
