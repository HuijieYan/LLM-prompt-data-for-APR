### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it calls `make_current` to create a new instance.
3. If `make_current` is specified and not `None`, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance. If the current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` might not work as intended.
2. The `elif make_current` statement could have an issue when checking a boolean value.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug might be caused by incorrect condition checking in the `initialize` function. The issue might occur when trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance based on the condition provided for `make_current`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the condition for `make_current` properly and handle the cases where it's `None` or a boolean value.
2. Update the logic to set the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is not None and make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the current `IOLoop` instance in a variable for later use.
- Check if `make_current is None` and create a new instance if the current instance is `None`.
- Handle the case when `make_current` is provided and set the current instance if it doesn't exist, and raise an error if it's already set.
