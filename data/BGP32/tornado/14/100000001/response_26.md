## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` has the following potential issues:
1. The `make_current` parameter is not being used correctly. It seems to be intending to determine whether the IOLoop should be made the current one or not, but the condition for raising RuntimeError is incorrect.
2. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used twice without clarity on its purpose.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The logic to determine whether the IOLoop should be made the current one or not is faulty, leading to the RuntimeError being raised inappropriately.

## Strategy for Fixing:
1. Revisit the logic to make sure that the `make_current` parameter is used correctly to decide the behavior of the function.
2. Clarify the conditions under which the IOLoop should be made the current one or not.
3. Ensure that the logic is clear and consistent throughout the function.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # If make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # If current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is used to check if the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is True. This way, the function behavior is based on whether the IOLoop should be made current or not, and the RuntimeError is only raised when necessary.
