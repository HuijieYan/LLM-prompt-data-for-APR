### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function is named initialize and it takes a parameter `make_current`. If `make_current` is None, it checks if the current instance of the IOLoop is `None` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and if it is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None and evaluates to True, it checks if the current instance of IOLoop is `None`, and if it is not `None`, it raises a RuntimeError. Otherwise, it calls `self.make_current()`.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The check for `make_current` in the `if` condition might not work as intended.
2. The logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance might be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in this function may arise from the incorrect use of the `make_current` parameter and the logic of checking the current IOLoop instance. The condition `elif make_current:` does not properly handle all cases for the `make_current` parameter.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to restructure the logic to properly handle all cases for the `make_current` parameter. We should also review the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance to ensure it functions correctly.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. The `elif make_current:` condition is changed to `else`.
2. The logic for checking the current IOLoop instance is properly inverted to check if it is not `None` before raising an error.
3. The `self.make_current()` call is moved out of the inner `if` block to ensure it runs if none of the previous conditions trigger.
