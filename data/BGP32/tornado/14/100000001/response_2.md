## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`. If both conditions are true, it calls `make_current()`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if it is `True`, and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` otherwise it calls `make_current()`.

## Identified Potential Error Locations:
1. There is a missing check for the case when `make_current` is `False`.
2. `self.make_current()` is called in both `if` conditions which might not be the intended behavior.
3. The `make_current` method is used without proper definition provided.

## Explanation of the Bug:
The bug is in the function logic where `make_current` is not handled when it is `False`. Also, `self.make_current()` is called in both `if` conditions which could lead to unnecessary calls.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a condition to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.
2. Correct the logic for calling `self.make_current()` to only call it when necessary.
3. Ensure proper definition and implementation of the `make_current()` method.

## Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is False:
        pass
```

In the corrected version:
- Added a condition `elif make_current is False` to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.
- Changed the logic for calling `self.make_current()` only in the necessary cases.
- Provided a placeholder `pass` for the case when `make_current` is `False`. This can be adjusted based on the actual requirement.
