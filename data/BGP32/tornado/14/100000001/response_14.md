## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a potential bug in the `if` and `elif` conditions. The bug arises from the logic flow in the `if` condition and the `elif` condition.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The `if` condition checks if `make_current` is None and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None. If both conditions are true, `self.make_current()` is called.
2. The `elif` condition checks if `make_current` is True, and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, it still calls `self.make_current()` after that check.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when both the `if` condition and the `elif` condition are satisfied simultaneously. This can lead to calling `self.make_current()` twice in the same instance creation, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that `self.make_current()` is not called redundantly and that the conditions in the `if` and `elif` statements are mutually exclusive.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- Removed the redundant call to `self.make_current()` in the `elif` condition.
- Ensure that `self.make_current()` is only called when none of the previous conditions are matched, i.e., `make_current` is False.
