## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance. The function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, it attempts to make it the current instance. It also includes a parameter `make_current` that determines whether to make the IOLoop instance current or not.

## Identified Error:
The potential error in the function lies in the conditions checking the current IOLoop instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is used to check if the current instance exists, but it seems incorrect. 

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function might not return `None` if the current instance is not present, leading to incorrect logic flow in the function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should update the condition to explicitly check if the current instance does not exist. We can modify the condition to check if the current instance is `None` instead of comparing it with `None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I modified the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:` in the `elif` branch as it needs to check if the current instance is not the same as the instance `self`. This change ensures the correct behavior and error handling in the function based on the intended logic.
