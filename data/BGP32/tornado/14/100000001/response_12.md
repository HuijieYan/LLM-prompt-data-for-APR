## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`, it calls `make_current` if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`. 

## Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` might not correctly identify when `make_current` is not specified.
2. The check for the current `IOLoop` instance might not work as intended.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in this function is that the condition `if make_current is None` is insufficient to distinguish the case where `make_current` is not specified. This can lead to incorrect behavior when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if `make_current` is not specified. Additionally, we need to ensure that the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is done correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `elif make_current is not None:` correctly checks if `make_current` is not specified. This ensures that the function behaves as intended in both cases. Additionally, the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is modified to ensure that the correct action is taken based on the current state of the `IOLoop` instance.
