### Analyzing the buggy function:

The `initialize` function is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance. However, there are potential issues with the logic implemented in this function that may lead to bugs.

### Potential error locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` might not be triggering the desired action of making the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is indeed `None`.
2. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists and handling potential RuntimeError is not correctly implemented.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the logic flow within the function. 

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for setting the current IOLoop instance and checking if it already exists is correctly implemented. This involves updating the condition checks and the overall structure of the function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Updated this part for better logic
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the condition checks and logic flow to address the identified potential error locations and ensure the function behaves as intended.
