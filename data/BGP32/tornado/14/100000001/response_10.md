## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop object. The function first checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if no current IOLoop instance exists. If none exists, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not None and evaluates to True, it checks if no current IOLoop instance exists and then calls `self.make_current()`.

## Bugs:
1. The main bug in this function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is repeated twice within the same code block. This results in calling `self.make_current()` twice unnecessarily when `make_current` is None. This can cause unexpected behavior.
2. The elif condition might not work as intended because it should check if `make_current` is not None and evaluate to True, but the current condition only checks if it is True. It should be modified to `elif make_current is not None and make_current`.
3. The error message in the `elif make_current` block is incorrect. It currently states "current IOLoop already exists," which is misleading as it should be the opposite (current IOLoop does not exist).

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the redundant check for `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` within the same code block.
2. Modify the elif condition `elif make_current` to check if `make_current is not None and make_current`.
3. Update the error message in the `elif make_current` block to accurately reflect the scenario.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None and make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("No current IOLoop instance exists when make_current is True")
        self.make_current()
```
