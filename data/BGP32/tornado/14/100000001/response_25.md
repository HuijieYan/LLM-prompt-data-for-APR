## Analysis:
1. The function `initialize` is supposed to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, make the current instance.
2. There are potential error locations in the condition checks and logic flow within the function.

## Identified issues:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` may not correctly handle cases where `make_current` is passed as `False` instead of `None`.
2. In the `elif make_current:` block, if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, it should not raise a `RuntimeError`, as it could be intentional.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug stems from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument and the logic flow within the function, leading to potential errors in checking the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the condition checks to correctly handle all possible values of `make_current`.
2. Refactor the logic flow to ensure that the function behaves as expected under various conditions.

## Corrected version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version, the function now correctly handles both `None` and `True/False` values of `make_current` and ensures that the `make_current` method is called or a `RuntimeError` is raised based on the current `IOLoop` instance and the value of `make_current`.
