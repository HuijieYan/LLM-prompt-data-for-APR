## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None, then checks if `IOLoop.current` is None and calls `self.make_current()`. However, there are a couple of potential errors in this function:

1. The condition `if make_current is None` does not handle the case when `make_current` is not None and `IOLoop.current` is None.
2. The usage of `self.make_current()` without proper error handling if `IOLoop.current` is already present.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function occurs when `make_current` is not None and `IOLoop.current` is None. In this case, the function should not call `self.make_current()` again as it may lead to an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the function, we need to update the condition to handle the case when `make_current` is not None. It should only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is None and `IOLoop.current` is also None. Additionally, we need to check for the current `IOLoop` instance before calling `self.make_current()`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we store the current `IOLoop` instance in `current_instance` variable to avoid repeated calls. Then we check for different conditions based on the value of `make_current` parameter to handle the initialization appropriately.
