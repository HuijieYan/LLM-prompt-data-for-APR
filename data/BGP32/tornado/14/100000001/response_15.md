## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the availability of the current instance of IOLoop and then either making it current or raising an error based on the value of `make_current`. The bug in this function lies in the condition `if make_current is None` where instead of checking for `None`, it should check for `False` as the condition `elif make_current` will only trigger when `make_current` is `True`.

## Error Location:
The error lies in the condition `if make_current is None`. This condition should be checking for `False`, not `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because the condition `if make_current is None` is not correctly evaluating the intention. This can lead to erroneous behavior based on the input value of `make_current`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
Change the condition `if make_current is None` to `if make_current is False` to correctly differentiate between the cases where `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is False:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
