## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object. It checks if the current IOLoop exists and creates one if it doesn't. However, there are potential errors in the logic flow based on the conditions provided.

## Identified Errors:
1. In the `if make_current is None` condition, the `make_current` method is called without actually checking if it exists within the class.
2. In the `elif make_current` condition, there is redundant code checking if the current instance already exists.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to incorrect logic flow and missing checks within the function. The code is trying to handle the case where `make_current` is `None`, but it does not verify the existence of the `make_current` method.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the existence of the `make_current` method before calling it.
2. Simplify the logic flow to avoid redundant checks.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            if hasattr(self, 'make_current') and callable(self.make_current):
                self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if hasattr(self, 'make_current') and callable(self.make_current):
            self.make_current()
```
