## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop by making it the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. The function checks if a current IOLoop exists and if not, it calls `make_current()` to set the current IOLoop. However, there are potential issues in the logic that need to be addressed to fix the bug.

## Identified Errors:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` should check if `make_current` is False, not None.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` is not checking if `make_current` is True. It can potentially raise an error even when `make_current` is False.
3. The second conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is repeated, which is redundant.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect condition checks for the `make_current` parameter. The function fails to correctly evaluate the state of `make_current`, leading to potential errors in setting the current IOLoop.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition `if make_current is None:` to check if `make_current` is False.
2. Update the condition `elif make_current:` to check if `make_current` is True.
3. Remove the redundant check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if not make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditions have been modified to correctly check the state of `make_current` and avoid redundant checks. This ensures that the current IOLoop is initialized correctly based on the provided parameter.
