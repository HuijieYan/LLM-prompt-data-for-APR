### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop instance if it does not already exist. However, there are a couple of potential issues in the function:
1. The `make_current` argument check is inconsistent and might lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The condition checks for the current IOLoop instance might not work as intended.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for `make_current` being `None` or not might not cover all cases correctly.
2. The condition checks for the current IOLoop instance could be improved.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the function lies in the inconsistency of the `make_current` check. If `make_current` is `None`, the function should create the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't already exist. However, the current implementation doesn't handle this case correctly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the condition check for `make_current` to cover the cases where `make_current` is `None` and `False`.
2. Adjust the condition checks for the current IOLoop instance to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition check for `make_current` covers both cases where it's `None` or `True`.
- The check for the current IOLoop instance is more accurately handled.
