## Analysis:
The buggy function has a logical error in the way it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The `make_current` parameter is used to determine whether to create a new IOLoop instance if none exists. The current logic incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and conditions are not fully handling all cases.

## Identified Errors:
1. The `make_current` parameter is not being properly handled in all cases.
2. The logic to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is flawed.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the `make_current` parameter. The check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is incorrect and may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.
2. Ensure that the check for the current IOLoop instance is done correctly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The `IOLoop.current()` method is called only once to prevent redundant calls.
- The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is fixed to correctly handle the creation of a new IOLoop instance.
- The check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance is corrected to avoid any potential errors.
