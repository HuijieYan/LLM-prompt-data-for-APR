## Analysis and Bug Description:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado.ioloop` module has a bug in the condition check for `make_current`. The bug occurs when `make_current` is not None and evaluates to True in the elif block, resulting in the RuntimeError exception being raised even when the IOLoop is not yet initialized.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the RuntimeError exception is only raised when the IOLoop instance is already initialized. Therefore, we should only raise the exception if `make_current` is True and the IOLoop instance is not None. Additionally, we should call `self.make_current()` only when IOLoop instance is None or `make_current` is True.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the if-else conditions are properly arranged to ensure that the IOLoop instance is checked before raising the RuntimeError exception and calling `self.make_current()` when necessary.
