# Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. The main issue in this function is that the `make_current()` method is called without being defined within the function or provided as input, potentially leading to a NameError. Additionally, the conditional statements are a bit unclear and could be simplified.

# Potential error locations:
1. `self.make_current()` may not be defined within the function.
2. The condition `elif make_current` may not work as intended.
3. Possible NameError due to calling `self.make_current()` without being defined.

# Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the unclear conditional statements and the use of `make_current()` without proper definition or input. This can lead to a NameError because the function `make_current()` is not provided within the scope of the `initialize` function.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `make_current()` method either within the class or provide it as an argument to the `initialize` function.
2. Simplify the conditional statements for better readability and logic flow.
3. Ensure that the `make_current()` method is only called when it exists and is properly defined.

# Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- The `make_current()` method should be defined within the class or provided as input to the `initialize` function.
- The conditional statements are simplified to handle the cases more explicitly.
- The function now properly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before calling `make_current()`.
