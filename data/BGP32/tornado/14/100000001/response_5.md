## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to check whether an IOLoop instance exists and make it current if needed. However, the logic within the function is flawed, causing potential issues.

## Potential error locations:
1. The `make_current()` method invocation within the `if` statements may result in unintended behavior.
2. The conditional statements may not be covering all possible scenarios for `make_current`.

## Cause of the bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the unclear logic flow and the incorrect use of the `make_current` parameter. The function does not handle all cases correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

## Bug-fix strategy:
1. Check if an IOLoop instance exists before making it current.
2. Handle the different scenarios for the `make_current` parameter appropriately.
3. Simplify the logic to ensure clarity and correctness.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By revising the function as shown above, we ensure that the logic is clear and correctly handles the cases where an IOLoop instance needs to be made current. This corrected version should provide the intended functionality without the previous bugs.
