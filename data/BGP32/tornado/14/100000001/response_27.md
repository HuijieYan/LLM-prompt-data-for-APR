## Analysis:
The function `initialize` is meant to set the current IOLoop instance, but there are a few issues in the implementation:
1. The `make_current` parameter is supposed to determine whether to make the current IOLoop instance, but it is not being processed correctly.
2. The condition `if make_current is None` does not handle the case where `make_current` is provided as `False`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function should check for the specific values of `make_current` (`None`, `True`, or `False`), but the current implementation only checks for `None` and `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle all values of the `make_current` parameter (`None`, `True`, `False`) appropriately. We should only call `self.make_current()` when explicitly specified by `make_current`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable. Then we check if `make_current` is `None` or `True` and act accordingly based on the presence of the current IOLoop instance.
