The bug in the provided function `initialize` is that it checks for `make_current` being `True`, but does not handle the scenario when `make_current` is `False`. This leads to a logical flaw in the function's decision-making process and can result in raising the RuntimeError inappropriately.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `make_current` is `False`. If it is `False`, we should set the current `IOLoop` instance to `None` if it exists. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the input value of `make_current`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        IOLoop.current(instance=False)
```

By adding the `else` condition to handle the case when `make_current` is `False`, we ensure that the function behaves correctly for all possible values of the `make_current` parameter.

This corrected version addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug where the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` evaluation might wrongly lead to raising the error "already exists".
