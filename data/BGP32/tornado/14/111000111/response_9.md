The buggy function `initialize` has an issue where it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True`. This check seems to be incorrect based on the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The error lies in the logic flow where if `make_current` is set to `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This logic is at odds with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, and incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if it does not exist. This contradicts the expected behavior that the issue is raising doubts about.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to align with the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue. The fix involves removing the `RuntimeError` exception when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function removes the check for `make_current` to be `True` and throws a `RuntimeError`. Instead, it directly sets the current instance of `IOLoop` without any exceptions when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance present.
