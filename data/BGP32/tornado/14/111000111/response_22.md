## Identification of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance incorrectly. This leads to a situation where it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should not in some cases.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Explanation
In the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, the condition `if make_current is None:` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, the function calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it doesn't, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop`.

The bug lies in the `elif make_current:` condition block. If `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, and if that condition is false, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists." This behavior is incorrect as it should not raise an error in this case.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, we should proceed to set the current `IOLoop` without raising an error.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods and documentation...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the issue reported in the GitHub bug report should be resolved. The function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
