## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug occurs in the logic of checking for the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug is related to determining whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists before making the current instance, but the current logic is flawed.
4. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.


## Bug Fix
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By the revised logic above, the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class should be resolved.
