### Analyzing the buggy function and its issue

- The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
- The function is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop, including making it the current IOLoop if required.
- The issue on GitHub highlights that there is confusion in the code when checking if the current IOLoop exists or not, especially in the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.
- The problem arises when the code raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists" even though the previous check implied that the current IOLoop was actually `None`.

### Error location and explanation

- The issue is primarily originating from the conditional checks related to the `make_current` variable.
- When `make_current` is `True`, the code first checks if the current IOLoop is `None`. If it is `None`, it should raise the `RuntimeError` since an IOLoop doesn't exist and cannot be made current.
- However, the reporting on GitHub suggests that the check is incorrectly detecting `None`, causing confusion and leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

### Bug fixing strategy

- To correct this bug, we need to review the logic around the `make_current` parameter and the checks regarding the current IOLoop's existence.
- The `make_current` logic should be consistent and properly evaluate whether a current IOLoop already exists before deciding whether to make the IOLoop current or raise an error.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Corrected explanation

- In the corrected version:
  - We invert the logic in the `elif` condition to check if the current IOLoop is not `None` when `make_current` is set to `True`.
  - This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is an existing current IOLoop when trying to make the IOLoop current.
- By applying this change, we address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure the function behaves correctly under different initialization scenarios.
