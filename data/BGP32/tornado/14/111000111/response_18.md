The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance if needed, based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug arises from the logic that checks if a current IOLoop exists or not before taking any action.

### Error location:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function where it tries to handle the case of setting the current IOLoop instance. The issue arises when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance does not exist.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy logic in the `initialize` function checks if `make_current` parameter is `True` and then checks if a current IOLoop instance exists or not. If the current IOLoop instance does not exist, it raises a RuntimeError with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This is misleading as it should actually perform the set_current operation.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`. Instead, directly call the `make_current` method to set the current IOLoop instance. This change will ensure that the behavior aligns with the intention of the function in the case when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making this correction, the function will now correctly set the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`, without raising any unnecessary errors based on the existence of a current IOLoop.
