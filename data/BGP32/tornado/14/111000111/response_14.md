### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised even if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Bug Explanation:
1. In the case where `make_current=True`, the function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it doesn't exist (`None`), it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior is contradictory and incorrect as the condition was intended to check if an instance does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to adjust the condition checking when `make_current=True`. We should raise the `RuntimeError` only when an instance already exists, rather than when it doesn't exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected the condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` in the `make_current` case with `make_current=True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
