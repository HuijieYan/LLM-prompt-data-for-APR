The bug in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The buggy function is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and either make it the current one or raise an error if it already exists. However, the logic for checking the existence of the current instance and raising an error is flawed.

### Identified Errors:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if the current instance is `None` again after the initial check.
3. If `make_current` is not provided, the function makes the current instance without properly handling the case where the current instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditions for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance are redundant and do not handle the scenario where the current instance already exists properly. This results in raising an error in cases where it should not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should simplify the logic for checking the existence of the current instance and ensure that the error is only raised when it is appropriate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first retrieve the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
- If `make_current` is not provided, we check if the current instance is `None` before making it the current one.
- If `make_current` is `True`, we directly check if the current instance is not `None` and raise an error if it already exists.
