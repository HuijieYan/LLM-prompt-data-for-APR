The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is incorrectly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead of raising an error, it should proceed with setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

The issue raised on GitHub questions why an error is being raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is checked to be `None` and then an error is raised for "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic to check if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, then proceed with setting the current instance. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

This corrected version will now properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing instance.
