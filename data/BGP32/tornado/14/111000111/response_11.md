### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by making it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the current implementation also checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before making it the current one, which leads to a logical error.
2. The bug is related to a misinterpretation of the logic where checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is unnecessary if `make_current` is `True` as per the expected behavior.
3. The cause of the bug is the unnecessary check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. This contradicts the expected behavior where setting `make_current=True` should always make the `IOLoop` instance current without verifying against an existing one.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

### Suggested Fix:
Remove the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` in the `initialize` function.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above change, the function will correctly handle the initialization logic without unnecessary checks, resolving the bug as per the expected behavior.
