Based on the analysis and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `initialize` function is due to an incorrect check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

The buggy part of the function is as follows:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The issue arises in the `initialize` function when checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists. The logic inside the `initialize` function wrongly assumes that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it means that there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, the correct interpretation is the opposite: if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it actually means that there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, the check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` should be inverted. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, we ensure that the correct conditions are checked for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This correction resolves the issue reported on GitHub as well.
