## Analyzing the buggy function and related information
- The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
- The function takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which is expected to be a boolean.
- The function checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and calls `self.make_current()`.
- If `make_current` is True, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The related functions in the class are `current` and `make_current` which are called within the `initialize` function.

## Identifying potential error locations
- The bug might be in handling the condition where `make_current` is True.

## Explaining the cause of the bug
The bug occurs because the condition for `make_current` being True is incorrect. It raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is opposite to the intended behavior.

## Suggested strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the condition checking for `make_current` being True should be adjusted to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Adjusted condition to fix the bug
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition in the `else` block for `make_current`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current `IOLoop` instance exists. This correction should fix the bug as described.
