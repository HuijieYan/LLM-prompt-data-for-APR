### Analysis:
1. **Bug:** The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and makes it current based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there is a bug where it raises a `RuntimeError` even if the current instance is `None`.
   
2. **Error Location:**
   - The bug occurs in the `initialize` function.
   - The bug is specifically in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` where the code incorrectly raises an error even when the current instance is `None`.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current instance of `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` parameter.
   - The conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is supposed to check if a current instance exists or not.
   - However, the bug arises from the fact that even when there is no current instance (`None` returned), the code proceeds to raise an error based on the logic in the `elif make_current` block.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Instead of raising an error when `None` is returned for the current instance, the condition should consider these cases separately to handle them correctly.
   - The logic should be adjusted to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
   
5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version ensures that the error is raised only when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance actually exists.
