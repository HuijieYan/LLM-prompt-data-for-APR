The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class occurs due to a logic error in handling the `make_current` parameter. The bug checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before making the current instance. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, but it incorrectly only checks once for a current instance and then proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the code block:
```python
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```
The logic here is flawed because once the first check `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is false, the code should not proceed to call `self.make_current()`. This creates a scenario where the error is raised unnecessarily.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `initialize` function to attempt to set the current `IOLoop` instance even if one already exists when `make_current` is `True`. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior, leading to the bug reported in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the block that handles the `make_current` parameter. We should only call `self.make_current()` if there is no current `IOLoop` instance (when `make_current` is `True).

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True`, then verify if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set it as the current instance. The bug is fixed by ensuring that the raise statement is only executed when needed, based on the correct conditions.
