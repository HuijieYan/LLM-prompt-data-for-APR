## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is intended to check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and either set the current `IOLoop` or raise an error based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The current issue reported on GitHub questions the logic in the function when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.
3. The cause of the bug seems to be that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how the function determines the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and handle the logic accordingly.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the condition that checks for an existing current `IOLoop` instance to ensure it functions correctly.
2. Modify the logic related to setting the current `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` argument to align with the expected behavior.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current()
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current()` for better readability and efficiency.
- In the case where `make_current` is `None`, we check if no current instance exists before setting the current `IOLoop`.
- When `make_current` is `True`, we verify that there is no existing current `IOLoop` before attempting to set it, as per the expected behavior.

This version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure the function behaves as intended.
