The bug in the provided `initialize` function occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. In this case, the function checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, and if it doesn't exist, it erroneously raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior contradicts the intention specified for the `make_current` argument.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition checking when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead of raising an error when there is no current `IOLoop`, we should proceed to make the current `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will behave as follows:
- If `make_current` is `None`, it will make the current `IOLoop` if none exists.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it will only make the current `IOLoop` if one already exists.

This adjustment aligns the function behavior with the expectations outlined in the GitHub issue mentioned. Now, the function handles the `make_current` argument correctly without raising a misleading error message.
