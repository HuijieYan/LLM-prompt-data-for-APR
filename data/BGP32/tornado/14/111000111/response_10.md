The bug in the `initialize` method arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is not specified, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then proceeds to make the current `IOLoop`. However, if `make_current` is specified as `True`, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if there is none, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` method to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter:

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class members and functions
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter according to the expected behavior and satisfy the test cases and the GitHub issue.
