### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it is not already set, based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug in the current implementation is that it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before attempting to make it the current one. This logic is flawed because it should check if the current instance is `None` before making it current, not after.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the current implementation checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before trying to make it current, which leads to inconsistent behavior when the instance exists. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised even when `make_current` is `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, and then proceed to make the instance current if required. If the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, an additional check should be made to ensure that there is no existing current instance before making the new instance current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter without raising unnecessary `RuntimeError` when it's not appropriate.
