The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue regarding the logic in handling the `make_current` parameter. The problem arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance is actually `None`, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Analysis:
1. Given the specific case to fix, the input parameter `make_current` is expected to be `True`.
2. The buggy function tries to ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, there must already be a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. However, the condition checking for the current `IOLoop` instance (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) does not align correctly with the logic of ensuring an existing instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` in the `initialize` function. This check incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if there is no current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the condition checking for the current `IOLoop` instance in the case where `make_current=True` needs to be revised. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` immediately if there is no current instance, it should proceed to set the current instance in that scenario.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current instance is None
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By updating the condition inside the `initialize` function, we ensure that if `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it will set the instance instead of raising a `RuntimeError` incorrectly.
