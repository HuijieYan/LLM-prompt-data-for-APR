## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` using the `current` method with `instance=False`.
3. If there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it then calls the `make_current` method.
4. If the `make_current` parameter is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists" and calls the `make_current` method.
5. The bug occurs in the case when `make_current=None` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. In this case, the `make_current` method should be called but it is not.

## Bug:
In the case when `make_current=None` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, the `make_current` method is not being called.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to add a call to `make_current()` when `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding `self.make_current()` inside the `if make_current is None` block, we ensure that the `make_current` method is called when necessary.
