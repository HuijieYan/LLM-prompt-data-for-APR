## Analysis

1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting a new instance as current. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if an instance already exists and if not, sets the current instance to the new one. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an instance exists and raises an error if so.
   
2. The potential error lies in the logic of checking if an instance already exists and setting it as current accordingly.

3. The cause of the bug is in the incorrect logic of checking the existing instance and setting the current instance. In the case when `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error only if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. The current implementation checks for the absence of an instance and then raises an error if it is missing.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

## Bug Fix

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` and then adjust the `if` conditions appropriately. When `make_current` is `True`, we check if a current instance exists and raise an error if it does. Otherwise, we complete the initialization process by setting the new instance as current.
