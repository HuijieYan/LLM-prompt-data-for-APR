### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is `None` and if `IOLoop.current` is not `None`. If both conditions are met, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should result in the current `IOLoop` instance being set as the current one.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even though the existing `IOLoop` instance should be set as the current one.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. It is raising a `RuntimeError` when it should not if `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We should only check if `IOLoop.current` is `None` when `make_current` is `None`. If `make_current` is `True`, we should set the current instance without raising any exception.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now set the current `IOLoop` instance correctly without raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`.
