### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if a current instance is `None`, and if so, it creates a new one. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if a current instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, and then tries to create another one with the same argument. The test expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised in this situation.

3. The error message indicates that the bug occurs when `make_current=True` is used for creating the second `IOLoop` object. It results in the `RuntimeError` being raised, indicating that a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. It should raise a `RuntimeError` in that situation, but it fails to do so.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True`. If an instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current=True`, the corrected version should now correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` accordingly. This should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
