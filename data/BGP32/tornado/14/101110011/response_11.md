### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. 
2. The issue arises when trying to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` even if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another one which should trigger a `RuntimeError` as expected.
4. The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the scenario where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.
5. The `IOLoop.current()` function should be used to check if there is a current instance before initializing a new one.
6. The logic inside the `initialize()` function needs to be updated to handle the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize()` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current()` method.
2. If there is a current instance and `make_current=True` is passed, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Only call `self.make_current()` when there is no current instance or when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize()` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
