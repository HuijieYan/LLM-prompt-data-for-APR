### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the logic is incorrect as it should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
2. The issue seems related to the incorrect logic used in the `initialize` function which is causing the error message to be raised incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists when setting `make_current` to `True`. The `if make_current:` condition should be modified to only check for an existing instance when `True` to fix this issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Fixed this condition to only check current instance if make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to only raise an error if the instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, the bug should be fixed.
