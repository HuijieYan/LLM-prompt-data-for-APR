### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado` library is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before deciding whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then verify that the current `IOLoop` instance is set correctly. The test expects an error to be raised if a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted.
3. The error occurs because the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is incorrectly raising an error when attempting to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` even if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. To fix this issue, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
  
### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Change the condition here
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change the condition here
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
