### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the scenario where a new `IOLoop` instance is being initialized. The issue arises when trying to force the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance by setting `make_current=True`, but the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance in the `IOLoop.current()` method is not functioning correctly. This results in the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug Cause:
1. The `initialize()` method checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, but the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking the opposite condition. It should check if it is not None to proceed with creating the new instance.

2. When attempting to force the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance using `make_current=True`, the condition `elif make_current:` should first check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by comparing it with `None`, and only raise an error if it is not None.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug in the `initialize()` method, we need to correct the conditions for checking the existence of an `IOLoop` instance and raise the `RuntimeError` only when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize()` method now checks for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance correctly and raises the `RuntimeError` only when necessary. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_force_current()` passes without any errors.
