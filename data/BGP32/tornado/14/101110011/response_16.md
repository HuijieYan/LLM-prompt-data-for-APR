### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
- The `initialize` method is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance if it's not already set, and it should raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.
- The failing test `test_force_current` is testing the behavior when creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when the current IOLoop instance is already set.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs in the `initialize` method when checking if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If `make_current` is true and a current IOLoop instance is already set, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Add additional logic to correctly check if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current=True` to prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised inappropriately.
- Ensure that the initialization logic handles the case when a current IOLoop instance is already set.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` method should correctly handle the case where an IOLoop instance is already set when `make_current=True` is specified. This fix should address the bug and allow the failing test `test_force_current` to pass successfully.
