### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is None, it should set the current instance to the new one being initialized. If it is not None and `make_current` is True, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and check if it raises the `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs because the existing logic in the `initialize` function is not handling the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is True. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current` is True, then raise the `RuntimeError`.
- Ensure that only one current `IOLoop` instance is allowed when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
 
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above modification to the `initialize` function, it should now handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is True, preventing the incorrect `RuntimeError` from being raised.
