### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance with the option to force it as the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current instance existing.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function is raising a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't, instead of setting the instance as the current one.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights this problem where there is confusion around why the code raises an error when the current instance is None.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current=True` is supplied and there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            self.current_instance = current_instance
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By checking if the current instance is not None and setting it accordingly, we resolve the issue with the original logic raising a `RuntimeError` when there's no need. This correction addresses the bug and should make the failing test pass successfully.
