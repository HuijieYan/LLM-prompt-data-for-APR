### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists before creating a new one. If `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, checks if it's the current IOLoop instance, and then tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The error occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists, but due to the incorrect condition, it always tries to make the current IOLoop instance, resulting in the error stating that the current IOLoop already exists.
4. To fix the bug, the condition for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists needs to be corrected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make it the current instance.
2. Adjust the logic to raise a `RuntimeError` only when `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the logic will correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. This fix should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
