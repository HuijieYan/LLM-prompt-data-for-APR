### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it proceeds to set the current instance. However, in the case of `make_current=True` being passed, it raises a `RuntimeError` even if the current instance is `None`, which is incorrect.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then checks if the current instance is correctly set and verifies that trying to create another instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True` is passed, the function should only raise an error if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, it incorrectly raises the error even if no current instance exists.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check when `make_current=True`. It should only raise an error if a current instance already exists. If no current instance exists, it should proceed to set the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected logic ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if a current instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the incorrect behavior in the `initialize` function.
