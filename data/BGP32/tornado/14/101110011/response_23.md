### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object.
2. The buggy function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before proceeding.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop object with `make_current=True`, expects it to be the current IOLoop instance, and then attempts to create another IOLoop object with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The error occurs because even if `make_current` is `True`, the buggy function still proceeds with calling `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, leading to the second object creation without raising an error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The function should only proceed with calling `self.make_current()` or raising an error if the current IOLoop instance exists. However, it is currently checking only if the current instance is `None`, which allows the creation of multiple IOLoop instances with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current instance exists when `make_current=True`, we ensure that a second IOLoop object cannot be created when a current instance is already present. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should make the failing test pass.
