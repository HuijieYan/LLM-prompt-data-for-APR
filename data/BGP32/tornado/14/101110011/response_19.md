### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class.
2. The issue seems to be related to how the `make_current` parameter is handled in the `initialize` method.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then ensure that attempting to create another instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs because even if `make_current` is `True`, if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, the `initialize` method mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` method to check for different conditions based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

This fix aligns with the expectations of the failing test and the reported GitHub issue. Now the corrected version of the `initialize` method should pass the failing test and resolve the reported bug.
