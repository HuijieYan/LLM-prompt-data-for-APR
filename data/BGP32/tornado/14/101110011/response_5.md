### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, and if the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the issue reported on GitHub highlights that the condition to check if the current instance is `None` is not working as expected.

### Bug Location:
The buggy location is in the `initialize` method where it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a logic error in the way the current instance of `IOLoop` is checked. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the instance is not present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the conditional checks in the `initialize` method to correctly determine if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the case where the `make_current` argument is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    @classmethod
    def current(cls, instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            return
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
            return
```

After applying the corrections, the `initialize` method should now handle the creation of the current instance of `IOLoop` correctly based on the `make_current` argument. This should address the bug reported in the failing test scenario.
