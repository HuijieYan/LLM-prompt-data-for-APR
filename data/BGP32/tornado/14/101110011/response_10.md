### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to check if the current IOLoop exists and make it the current one if not specified otherwise. However, the bug causes it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop does not exist.
2. The test function `test_force_current` initializes an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to become the current IOLoop instance. The test then checks if the same IOLoop instance is indeed the current one.
3. The bug occurs because the check for an existing current IOLoop is flawed in the `initialize` function - it incorrectly raises an error even when the current IOLoop is not present.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when a current IOLoop does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised to only trigger when a current IOLoop instance already exists, rather than when it doesn't.
2. Update the `initialize` function to set the current IOLoop instance if `make_current=True` is explicitly provided.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, the issue reported in GitHub should now be resolved. The corrected logic ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists.
