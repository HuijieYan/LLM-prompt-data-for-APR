### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue where it raises a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` is trying to test the behavior of creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is not the expected behavior based on the failing test.
4. The GitHub issue points out the discrepancy between the actual behavior and the expected behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.
5. The issue occurs due to the conditional check in the `initialize` function that does not handle the case properly when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and `make_current=True`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and `make_current=True`.
2. Modify the conditional checks to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change in the `initialize` function, the issue with raising `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` will be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test successfully.
