### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize an IOLoop instance. The issue arises when trying to enforce a single current IOLoop instance using the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug is located in the logic of the `initialize` function inside the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional check for `make_current`.
3. The bug occurs because if `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop already exists, it should raise an error. However, the current logic checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None before raising the error. This check is incorrect and leads to the wrong behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.
5. We will provide a corrected version of the `initialize` function below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing functions in the class

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                # If current IOLoop doesn't exist, make it current
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None:
                # If current IOLoop already exists, raise an error
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check in the `initialize` function, we now correctly handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists while `make_current` is set to `True`. This change should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass as expected.
