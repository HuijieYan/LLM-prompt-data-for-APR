### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current`. It should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one.
2. The test function `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even when an IOLoop instance is not already present, which is incorrect.
4. The issue posted on GitHub suggests a concern regarding the condition check at line 252 and questions why the error is raised in that situation.
   
### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `initialize` function's condition check for `make_current=True`. The condition might be incorrectly evaluating to `True` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug causes the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` to be raised incorrectly. This happens because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is evaluating to `False`, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when there is no existing IOLoop instance.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition checks in the `initialize` function to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing IOLoop instance and `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition checks in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
