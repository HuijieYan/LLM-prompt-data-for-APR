### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to force it to be the current instance.
2. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but there is already a current IOLoop instance existing.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if another IOLoop instance already exists.
4. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance.
5. The GitHub issue questions the decision to raise an error when checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `make_current=True`, the code checks for the current IOLoop instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. However, the intention was to allow forcing a new IOLoop instance as the current one.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, it should enforce creating a new IOLoop instance as the current one, overriding any existing instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition to allow overwriting current instance
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is kept for the non-forced case.
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` is added for the forced case to check if a current IOLoop instance exists before raising an error.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
