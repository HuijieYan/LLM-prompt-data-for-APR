### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in both branches of the `initialize` function could be causing the issue.
2. The logic within the `initialize` function where the `make_current` parameter is checked and handled depending on its value might not be working correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is called with `make_current=True`. The faulty logic within the function leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when `IOLoop.current()` is None.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic inside the `initialize` function correctly handles the case when `make_current=True` without raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` check in the `elif make_current:` branch to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

This correction should address the bug and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
