### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it verifies if the current `IOLoop` instance is None before calling `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is provided and evaluates to True, it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and raises a `RuntimeError` if not.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is attempting to construct an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expect the first call to be successful, and the subsequent call to raise a `RuntimeError`.

3. The error message indicates that during the second call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)`, the check for the current `IOLoop` instance being None is failing and hence, the `RuntimeError` is raised. This issue is pointing out the discrepancy between the check and the error message.

4. The issue on GitHub highlights the confusion regarding the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` always being true. This is leading to the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` always evaluating to True, regardless of the actual current state. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the condition checking for the current `IOLoop` instance being None is accurate. It should reflect the actual state of the `IOLoop` instance to prevent the incorrect raising of the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
    
    def make_current(self):
        

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version above:
- Changed `instance=False` to `instance=True` in both condition checks of the `initialize` function.
- In the second condition where `make_current` is provided, changed the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, correcting the logic.

This corrected version should address the bug and make the `initialize` function behave as intended, passing the failing test case.
