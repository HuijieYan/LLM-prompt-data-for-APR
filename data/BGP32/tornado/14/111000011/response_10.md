### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and making it the current instance if it doesn't already exist.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic where if `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current instance is `None` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, but then it goes ahead and calls `self.make_current()` regardless of the result.
3. The bug can be causing confusion as it seems contradictory to check if the current instance is `None` and then raise an error if it is not `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to handle the scenario where `make_current` is `None` and the current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
- Update the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` and the current instance already exists.
- Only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above adjustments in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed and the logic will be clearer in handling the creation of the current `IOLoop` instance.
