### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before calling the `make_current` method. However, the logic seems to be incorrect, as it should not raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Error Locations:
1. Line 11: The if condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in the `initialize` function is expecting the current instance to be `None`.
2. Line 15: The `raise` statement is triggered when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, which is causing the error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is due to the incorrect evaluation of the current `IOLoop` instance. The logic mistakenly raises an error if the current instance is `None`, which is different from what was intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only call `make_current` when needed, without raising an error if the current instance is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods here

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance` variable. Then, we adjust the conditions inside the `initialize` function to perform the intended behavior: only call `make_current` if needed, without raising an error when the current instance is `None`.
