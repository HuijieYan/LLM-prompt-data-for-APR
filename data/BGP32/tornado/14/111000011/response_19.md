### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and then makes the current instance if needed.
3. The issue reported on GitHub points to a discrepancy where the function is raising an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic of checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function incorrectly raises an error when checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not handled correctly, leading to the erroneous RuntimeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize` function to accurately determine if there is an existing current instance of `IOLoop` before taking action. We should only raise an error if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function will now properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error only when necessary.
