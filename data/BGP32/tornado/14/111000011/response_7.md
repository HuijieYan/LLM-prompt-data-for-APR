### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for checking the current instance of the `IOLoop` and setting it as the current one if needed.
2. The `current` function returns the current `IOLoop` instance and is used to check if there is already an existing instance.
3. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, it should not raise an error because the intention is to create a new instance and set it as current.
4. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` followed by `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` is incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to a faulty conditional check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it incorrectly raises an error stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance by directly setting the current instance without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it directly sets the current instance without raising an error. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the comments.
