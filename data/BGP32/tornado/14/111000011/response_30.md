### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is None or not. If it is None, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If not, it tries to make the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` and raises an error if there is. It then tries to make the current instance.
3. The issue in the GitHub describes a confusion regarding the logic in line 252. The concern is if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning None, why is it raising an error for "current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In line 252, the logic of checking `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` for None might be causing confusion.
2. The condition for raising an error might not be correctly aligned with the logic of checking the current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by a misunderstanding in the logic implementation. The intention might be to check if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` before trying to make it the current instance. However, the condition for raising an error is misleading when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function should be reviewed to ensure that the conditions for checking the current instance and handling `make_current` argument are correctly aligned. The error conditions should be updated to reflect the intended behavior without causing confusion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition to check if an instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the condition in line 252 to check if there is an instance of `IOLoop` before attempting to make it the current instance. This will prevent the confusion described in the GitHub issue.
