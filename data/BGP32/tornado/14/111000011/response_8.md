### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class initializes the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument passed to it.
2. The function uses the `current` method to check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. If not, it calls the `make_current` method to set the current instance.
3. The `make_current` method is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
4. The bug seems to occur when `make_current=None`. In this case, if an instance of `IOLoop` does not exist, the `make_current` method should be called to set the current instance. However, the code is checking for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`.
5. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion about the logic at line 252 where it checks for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raises an error for "current IOLoop already exists".

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, instead of checking if an `IOLoop` instance exists using `is None`, it should check if an instance does not exist using `is not None`. This incorrect check leads to the unexpected error message when the instance actually does not exist.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be updated to check if an instance of `IOLoop` does not already exist when `make_current=None`. This will ensure that the `make_current` method is called only when needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the bug in the `initialize` function should be fixed, and the error message related to the existing `IOLoop` instance should be resolved.
