### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None or not before making it the current instance. The issue reported on GitHub points out a potential inconsistency where the function raises an error stating "current IOLoop already exists" even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug could be occurring in the `initialize()` function where it incorrectly raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the conditional check in the `initialize()` function. The function is first checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, but it should only raise an error if the current instance already exists. The current logic is not handling the case where the current instance is None properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks in the `initialize()` function to handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None correctly. We should only raise an error if the current instance exists and `make_current` is True.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()  
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking if the current instance exists has been updated. The error will only be raised if `make_current` is True and the current instance exists. This modification should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
