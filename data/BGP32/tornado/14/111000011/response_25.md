### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class checks the current instance of `IOLoop` using the `current` function and then initializes a new `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic where it checks if the current instance is `None` and whether to make the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The issue raised in GitHub questions the logic at line 252 where it checks `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raises an error "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior is inconsistent as the condition checks for `None` initially.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic at line 252 to correctly handle the case where the current instance is `None` before raising an error.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We should first check if the current instance is `None`, and if not, then proceed based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. If the current instance is `None`, only then an error should be raised if `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. We should remove the redundant check for the current instance being `None` after the initial check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class should address the issue reported on GitHub by adjusting the logic to handle the current instance correctly before deciding whether to raise an error.
