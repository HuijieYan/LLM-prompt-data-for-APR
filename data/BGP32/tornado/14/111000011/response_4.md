## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is None, then it checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function. If there is no current instance, it calls `self.make_current()`. If the `make_current` parameter is True, it checks again if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and raises an error if there is one.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` may not handle the case properly where `make_current` is False.
2. The logic for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` might be incorrect.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to False. In this case, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` will return True, indicating that there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. However, the code still calls `self.make_current()` which may introduce a new current instance of `IOLoop`. This conflicts with the intention of the function when `make_current` is False.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the case when `make_current` is False and avoid calling `self.make_current()`.
2. Refactor the logic to handle the different scenarios more accurately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance`. Then, we check the conditions based on this variable to avoid unnecessary calls to `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is False.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub regarding the behavior of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class.
