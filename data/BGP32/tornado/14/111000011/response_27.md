### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and if `make_current` is `True`, then it raises a `RuntimeError` "current IOLoop already exists" even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.
2. The related functions `current` and `make_current` are used for managing the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The issue on GitHub indicates confusion about why the error message "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This inconsistency suggests a bug in the logic of the `initialize` function.
4. The bug is likely due to the conditional check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` not properly handling the case when `make_current=True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and setting the `make_current` flag is correctly implemented.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
2. If `make_current` is `None`, check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then make the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if there is one, otherwise make the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the conditional checks and handling the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True` appropriately, the corrected version of the `initialize` function ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is managed correctly based on the provided arguments.
