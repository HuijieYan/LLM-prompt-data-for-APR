### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance.
2. The function checks if a current IOLoop instance exists and whether to make the current instance.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is None. In this case, it checks if a current instance does not exist using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then calls `self.make_current()` to make the current instance.
4. The bug is related to the logic where it checks for the existence of a current instance before making the current instance.
5. The GitHub issue points out that line 252 (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) is causing confusion because it appears to be checking for the existence of a current instance but then raises an error for "current IOLoop already exists".

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function where the logic to check for the existence of a current instance is incorrect. It should only raise an error if a current instance does exist when `make_current` is True.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is None and a current IOLoop instance exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("No current IOLoop exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Changes Made:
1. Changed the condition in the first block to check if a current instance exists and raise an error if it does.
2. In the `elif` block, changed the condition to check if a current instance does not exist when `make_current` is True.
3. Updated the logic to handle the cases correctly based on the value of `make_current`.
