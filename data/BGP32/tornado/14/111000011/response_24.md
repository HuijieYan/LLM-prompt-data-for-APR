### Steps:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter passed to it. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if an instance already exists and if not, it sets itself as the current instance. If `make_current` is provided and is `True`, it checks if an instance already exists and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` because it should not try to make itself the current instance when there is already one.
   
2. The potential error locations in the `initialize` function could be in the logic where it compares the current instance with `None` and in the conditions where it checks whether to set itself as the current instance.
   
3. The cause of the bug could be that the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect when checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. It should not try to make itself the current instance if there is already an instance present.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to only set itself as the current instance if `make_current` is provided and set to `True` and there is no current instance present. If `make_current` is not provided, it should not raise an error since it should only set itself as the current instance in that case.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function checks whether the current instance exists before attempting to make itself the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter. It only raises an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current instance, as intended.
