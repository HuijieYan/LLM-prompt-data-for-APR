### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue reported on GitHub points out that there is a contradiction in the logic at line 252 in the `initialize` function related to the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None` but still raising an error for "current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential Error Locations:
The potential error locations are in the logic where it checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and decides whether to set it as the current instance or raise an error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional logic in the `initialize` function. The logic is not using the `make_current` argument correctly to determine whether to set the current instance or raise an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we will correct the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. We will use the `make_current` argument to control the behavior of setting the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance in a variable for better readability. Then, we use the `make_current` argument to conditionally set the current instance or raise an error based on the current state of the `IOLoop`.
