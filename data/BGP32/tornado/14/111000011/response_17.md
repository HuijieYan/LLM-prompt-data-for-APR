### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` or not. If it is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls the `make_current` function to set the current instance.
- The buggy part is when `make_current` is not `None`, it checks again if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is none, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists," which is contradictory.
- The issue on GitHub questions why the `RuntimeError` is raised when it should not be in that particular case.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the redundant check for a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. This check should be eliminated to avoid the contradictory behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the `initialize` function to only set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter without the redundant check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version removes the redundant check for a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` to prevent the contradictory behavior.
