### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if needed.
- The bug occurs when the `initialize` function checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not before setting the new `IOLoop` instance.
- The bug arises from the logic in the `initialize` function that incorrectly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The GitHub issue points out the confusion in the logic at line 252 where it raises an error for an already existing `IOLoop` instance even if it is None.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs due to the incorrect condition checking in the `initialize` function. 
- The if statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` incorrectly checks for the absence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then raising an error if `make_current` is not specified.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
- We should only raise an error if `make_current` is explicitly set to True and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the buggy function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Changes made:
- Modified the condition check in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
- Only raise an error when `make_current` is explicitly set to True and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.

By making these changes, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the `initialize` function should now set the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.
