**Analysis:**

1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` inside the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
   
2. The function checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is None, it calls the `make_current` function. If `make_current` is True, it verifies again if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

3. The error mentioned in the GitHub issue is due to the fact that the logic in the function is incorrect. If `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as per the current logic. The issue reported on GitHub questions this behavior.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic of the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None without raising a `RuntimeError`.

**Strategy for fixing the bug:**

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function. We should check if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, then we should simply call the `make_current` function without raising a `RuntimeError`. This ensures that the `make_current` function is always called in that scenario without any errors.

**Corrected Version:**

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue by handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None appropriately.
