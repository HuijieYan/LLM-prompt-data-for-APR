### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before calling the `make_current()` function. If `make_current` is `True`, it then checks again if the current instance is `None`, and if not, raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. When checking if `make_current is None`.
2. When checking if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. In this case, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is misleading.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
In the `initialize` function, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current is True` and the current instance is `None`. The condition for checking if the current instance already exists needs to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The `current_instance` is fetched once at the beginning of the function.
- If `make_current` is `True` and `current_instance` is not `None`, then a `RuntimeError` will be raised correctly.
- If `make_current` is `None`, and `current_instance` is `None`, then `self.make_current()` will be called.

This corrected version should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
