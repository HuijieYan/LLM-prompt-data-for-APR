### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue when checking the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` and stops the initialization of the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another one with the same argument, expecting the second construction to fail with a `RuntimeError`.
- The initial construction of the `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should always succeed. The error occurs during the second attempt when it should raise a `RuntimeError`, but currently, it doesn't.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The logic in the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is an existing instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
- Ensure that the `initialize` function correctly sets the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Raise an error if there is already a current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction to the `initialize` function, the failing test `test_force_current` should now pass successfully.
