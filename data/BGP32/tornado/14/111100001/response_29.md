## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The `initialize` function checks for the value of `make_current` parameter and then calls `IOLoop.current` and `self.make_current` accordingly.
3. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is already the current instance.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` twice, expecting the second call to raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is already the current instance, the function incorrectly tries to make the new instance the current one, resulting in the `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` before attempting to make the new instance the current one. If an existing instance is already the current one, we should raise a `RuntimeError` immediately.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By modifying the condition inside the `elif make_current` block to only call `self.make_current()` if no current instance exists, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
