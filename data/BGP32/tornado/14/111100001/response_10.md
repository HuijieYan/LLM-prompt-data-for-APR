## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is `None`. If so, it checks if an instance of `IOLoop` is already current. If not, it calls the `make_current` function. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if an instance of `IOLoop` is already current and then either raises an error or calls `make_current`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects the current instance to be set accordingly. It then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` and expects to receive a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug:
- The bug occurs in the `initialize` function because when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if an instance of `IOLoop` is already current. If not, it raises an error. However, in the failing test, the first `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, so an instance is already current. Therefore, the second instance creation should not raise a `RuntimeError`, but it does.

## Fix:
- The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the condition in the `initialize` function when `make_current=True` to only raise an error if there is no instance currently set as current, but allow the creation of the instance without error if an instance is already current.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                pass
```
