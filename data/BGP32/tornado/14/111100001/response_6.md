## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object.
2. The `initialize` function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` using the `current` function.
3. If the `make_current` parameter is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and verifies that subsequent attempts to create another current instance should fail.

## Bug Explanation:
The bug in the current implementation of the `initialize` function lies in the condition where `make_current` is not `None`. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` and then proceeds to raise a `RuntimeError` even though the intention is to create a new current instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where `make_current` is `True` to ensure that it only raises a `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current instance of `IOLoop`. If there is no current instance, it should proceed to set the current instance to the newly created `IOLoop` object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this fix, the corrected version of the function will correctly handle the creation of a new current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True` and will raise a `RuntimeError` only when trying to create a new current instance when one already exists.
