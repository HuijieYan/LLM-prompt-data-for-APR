## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug seems to be in how the `make_current` argument is handled in the `initialize` function.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug is likely in the logic of checking for the current `IOLoop` instance and handling the `make_current` argument. The logic needs to be corrected to ensure that the behavior is as expected by the test.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would involve checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current instance, and correctly handling the `make_current` argument based on whether an instance already exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the initialize function in the IOLoop class

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the logic has been fixed to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectations of the failing test `test_force_current`.
