## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to make a newly constructed `IOLoop` instance the current `IOLoop` if one does not exist. However, there is a bug in the logic of the function that causes it to fail the test case `test_force_current` where the function is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` in a specific scenario.

## Bug Explanation:
In the current implementation of the `initialize` function:
1. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If there is no current instance, it makes the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` and if there is a current instance, it makes that instance the current one.

The bug here is that in the case when `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` only if there is no current instance, which is the opposite of what the test case expects. The test case expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when there is already a current instance.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. Specifically, we should raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance. 

## Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case `test_force_current`.
