## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, sets the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't already exist.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The bug seems to be in the condition where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before setting the current loop. This logic might be incorrect.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect conditional logic in the `initialize` function. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if the current loop instance exists, but it may not be returning the correct value.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should revise the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance's existence. Using `instance=False` might not be returning the expected result. We should revise this logic to ensure that the current loop is correctly identified before setting it or raising an error.

## Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
# this is the corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to directly call `IOLoop.current()` without passing `instance=False`, we can ensure the correct behavior based on the `make_current` parameter. This revised logic should fix the bug and make the test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
