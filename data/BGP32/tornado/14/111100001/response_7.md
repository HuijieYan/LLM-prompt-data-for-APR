### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current IOLoop by calling `make_current` method if `make_current` is `None` or `True`. However, there is a bug in the logic that is causing it to fail the `test_force_current` test case.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of `make_current=None`.
2. Incorrectly checking for the existence of the current IOLoop.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `None`, the code checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, which is a wrong condition to determine if a current IOLoop already exists. This causes the `make_current` call to fail even if there is no current instance. As a result, the test case fails.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance by calling `IOLoop.current()` directly instead of checking if it is `None`.
2. Modify the logic to properly handle the initialization based on the value of `make_current`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_io_loop = IOLoop.current()
    if make_current is None:
        if current_io_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_io_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function should now correctly initialize the current IOLoop based on the value of `make_current` and pass the failing test.
