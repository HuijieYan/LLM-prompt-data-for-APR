## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it is not already set based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The issue in the buggy function lies in the conditional logic for handling the `make_current` parameter.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function.
- The logic currently checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then tries to set the `IOLoop` instance as the current one. The issue arises when `make_current` is not `None` (which means it should always become the current `IOLoop`) but the logic incorrectly checks for the absence of a current instance and raises an error, preventing the correct initialization.
- This leads to the `make_current=True` construction failing, even when it should be allowed.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- Check the `make_current` parameter properly and adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle cases where `make_current` is `True`.
- Ensure that the `initialize` function sets the current `IOLoop` instance as intended when `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment to the conditional logic, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the provided parameter.
