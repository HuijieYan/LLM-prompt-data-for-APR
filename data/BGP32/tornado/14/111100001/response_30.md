The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not properly setting the current `IOLoop` instance when the `make_current` parameter is passed as `True`. The bug occurs when the function is checking if there is already a current instance, but it fails to properly set the current instance when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the `initialize` function properly sets the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, we ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is properly set when `make_current` is `True`.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now set the current instance correctly based on the `make_current` parameter. This will allow the failing test `test_force_current` to pass as expected.
