### Analysis:
1. The `IOLoop` class contains a `initialize` function that is responsible for setting the current IOLoop.
2. The `initialize` function takes a `make_current` argument which controls whether the current IOLoop should be set or not.
3. The buggy function in the `initialize` function is failing to handle the logic properly when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` is testing this scenario where attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current instance should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the code incorrectly checks if there is no current instance and then sets the current instance in the `if` block. This causes the logic to fail and the test to fail as well.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to change the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix, the `initialize` function should handle the `make_current=True` case properly and pass the failing `test_force_current` test.
