## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The `initialize` function takes an optional argument `make_current`, which determines whether the `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance.
3. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it makes the instance current.
4. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if there is, or makes the instance current.
5. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if a new `IOLoop` instance can be made current, and if a second attempt to make it current fails.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the logic for handling the `make_current` argument. The issue arises when trying to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. 
Here are the specific issues:
1. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is used to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, the `instance=False` argument is incorrect, and it should be `instance=True` to check for the existence of a current instance.
2. Another issue is with the logic for handling `make_current=None`. It should set the `make_current` argument to `True` when there is no current instance, but the logic is currently flawed.

## Fix:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to make the following corrections:
1. Change `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` in both conditions where it is used to correctly check for the existence of a current instance.
2. Update the logic for `make_current=None` to set `make_current` to `True` when there is no current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            make_current = True
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the above corrections, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` argument correctly and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
