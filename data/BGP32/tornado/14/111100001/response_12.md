### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and then proceeds to make the current instance accordingly.
3. The bug occurs when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an instance already exists as the current instance, which results in a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` before checking if there is already a current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function should first check if there is already a current instance before deciding whether to raise a `RuntimeError` or make the current instance. It should only raise the error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. Otherwise, it should proceed to make the instance current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected version, the bug should be fixed and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
