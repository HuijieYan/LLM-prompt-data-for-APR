### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the initialization logic of the IOLoop instance.
2. The `initialize` function checks the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to set the current IOLoop instance.
3. The buggy function is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and trying to raise an error accordingly.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` is checking if the second construction of IOLoop with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function does not handle the case where there is already an existing current IOLoop instance correctly. It is trying to check if the current instance exists with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which is incorrect. If an exception is raised when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True`, the existing IOLoop instance might be modified.

### Solution Strategy:
1. Instead of checking for the existence of the current instance, it would be better to handle the `make_current` logic directly.
2. Modify the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current` is `True`. If so, directly try to set the current instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance without any prior checks.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` logic correctly and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
