## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the condition where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If both conditions are met, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempting to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` again, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The issue seems to be with the logic in the `initialize` function where the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is not properly handled.

## Bug:
- The bug is in the `initialize` function where it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` should be handled differently in this case.

## Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- We can modify the `initialize` function to check for the specific case where `make_current=True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance, and raise a `RuntimeError` in that scenario.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition to check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
