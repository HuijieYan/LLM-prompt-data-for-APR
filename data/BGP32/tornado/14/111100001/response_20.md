## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then calls the `make_current` function to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it also checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` to avoid creating multiple instances of `IOLoop`.

## Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of raising an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, it allows the creation of a new instance.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case to prevent the creation of multiple instances.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This will ensure that multiple instances are not created when `make_current=True`.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
