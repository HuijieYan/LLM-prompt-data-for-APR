The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case to prevent creating a new instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. The corrected function should pass the failing test provided.
