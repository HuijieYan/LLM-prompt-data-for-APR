## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The function checks the `make_current` parameter and either makes the `IOLoop` instance current or raises an error if it already exists.
4. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
5. The current logic may not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it does not handle the case properly when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
