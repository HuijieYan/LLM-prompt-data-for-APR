The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't handle the case when `make_current=False` correctly. Currently, it only checks for `None` or `True` values of `make_current` but doesn't consider the case where `make_current` is set to `False`. This results in the function not setting the current `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to explicitly handle the case where `make_current=False`. We can check if `make_current` is `False` and if so, ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is not changed.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:  # Handle make_current=False case
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            # No current IOLoop exists, do nothing
            pass
        else:
            # If current IOLoop exists and make_current=False, do not change it
            return
```

With this modification, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current=False`, ensuring that the current `IOLoop` instance is not changed unnecessarily. This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
