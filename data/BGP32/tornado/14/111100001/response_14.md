The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is that it is incorrectly checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. 

The buggy logic is as follows:
- If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop`, then it makes the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop`, it raises an error.
- In both cases, after the first check for the current `IOLoop` instance, it directly calls `self.make_current()`, which will set the current `IOLoop` instance.

The correct logic should be:
- If `make_current` is `None`, it should only make the current instance if there is no current `IOLoop` instance already present.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `initialize` function as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is set or an error is raised based on the parameter value.

After making this correction, the provided failing test for the `force_current` scenario should now pass successfully.
