## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks the `make_current` parameter to decide whether to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The bug is located in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before making the new instance the current one.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug in the `initialize` function is that it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` to determine if an instance already exists. However, this check does not accurately reflect whether a current instance exists because the `current` function returns the instance itself, not `None`.
- As a result, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` will always be false, leading to the incorrect behavior of trying to make a new `IOLoop` instance current even if one already exists.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we should change the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check if a current instance already exists before attempting to make a new instance the current one.
- Instead of checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, we should check if the current instance is not `None`, indicating that a current instance is already present.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            return
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make a new instance the current one. This will fix the bug and allow the provided test case to pass successfully.
