### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current IOLoop instance.
2. The `initialize` function accepts an optional argument `make_current`, which specifies whether the current IOLoop instance should be made the current one.
3. In the test case `test_force_current`, it checks if calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` results in the correct behavior, ensuring that only one current IOLoop instance can exist.
4. The bug is related to the logic in the `initialize` function, where it should handle the case of setting the current IOLoop instance correctly based on the provided `make_current` argument.

### Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises due to incorrect logic for handling the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is provided as `True`, the code fails to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the instance current. This results in an incorrect RuntimeError being raised in certain cases.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True`, then verify if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present before proceeding. If there is an existing current instance, raise an error.
2. Check for the case when `make_current` is `None` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, then make the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By checking the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make a new instance current, the corrected logic ensures the correct behavior based on the `make_current` argument.
