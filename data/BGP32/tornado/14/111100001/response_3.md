The bug in the `initialize` function is the incorrect condition check when `make_current` argument is provided. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be incorrectly raised even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition check in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True`. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this update, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the scenario when `make_current` is `True` without incorrectly raising the `RuntimeError`.

This correction should pass the failing test provided.
