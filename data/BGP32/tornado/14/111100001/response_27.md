### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and make itself the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the logic inside the if conditions is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The `make_current` parameter is not being handled properly, leading to an incorrect check for the current `IOLoop` instance and the raising of a `RuntimeError` in the wrong case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. If `make_current` is not provided (None), the function should only make it the current instance if there is no current instance already.
2. If `make_current` is True, the function should only make it the current instance if there is already a current instance. Otherwise, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the provided failing test case should now pass.
