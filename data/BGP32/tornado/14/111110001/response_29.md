### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The buggy function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object with an optional argument `make_current` which defaults to None.
3. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and then check if the current `IOLoop` is the same. It then tries to create another `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, which should fail.
4. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is True but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the buggy function incorrectly raises an error instead of just returning without setting a new current instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to check if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance before trying to set it as the current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is True and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. If there is no existing current `IOLoop`, then set this `IOLoop` instance as the current one.
3. If `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, simply return without setting the new instance to avoid raising an error.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            return  # Avoid setting a new current instance if one already exists
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, it should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance without raising any errors.
