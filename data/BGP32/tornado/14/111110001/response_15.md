### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance with an optional argument `make_current`.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if an IOLoop instance is already the current instance using the `current` function. If not, it calls `make_current`.
3. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if there is already a current instance. If so, it raises a `RuntimeError`, otherwise it proceeds to set the instance as the current.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the `initialize` function incorrectly checks for an existing current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which would always result in `None` because the `current` function defaults to creating a new instance if none exists.
- As a result, the condition to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists never evaluates to `True`, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic of checking for the current IOLoop instance. We can modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing `instance=False` to `instance=True` during the check for the current IOLoop instance, the corrected logic will correctly identify if an instance already exists. This change will ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as intended and passes the failing test.
