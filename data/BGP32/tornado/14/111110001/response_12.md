### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` since there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `initialize()` does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the `initialize()` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. 

### Corrected Version of the `initialize()` function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            return  # Added return statement to exit the function here
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition to check if current instance is not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. It will raise a `RuntimeError` only if there is no current instance and `make_current=True`.

### Expected Behavior:
The corrected version of the `initialize()` function should pass the failing test `test_force_current` without raising a `RuntimeError`.
