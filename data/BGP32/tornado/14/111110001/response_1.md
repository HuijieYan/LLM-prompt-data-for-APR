## Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function initializes an IOLoop instance and allows making it the current instance if certain conditions are met.
3. The failing test is attempting to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` as it is trying to set a new current IOLoop instance when one already exists.
4. The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly handling the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists, resulting in a failure to raise the `RuntimeError`.
5. The buggy function can be fixed by checking if `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing this fixed version of the `initialize` function, the test `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
