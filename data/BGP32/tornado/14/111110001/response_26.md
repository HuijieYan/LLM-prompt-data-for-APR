The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and tries to make the current instance if `make_current` is not provided. However, when `make_current=True` is passed, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists but it should not. 

To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, the function should proceed to make the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will behave as expected based on the provided test case and the error message. Now, the corrected `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
