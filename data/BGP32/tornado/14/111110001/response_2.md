## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and acts accordingly based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue arises when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists, raising a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug:
The bug is in the `initialize` function where the logic for handling the case of `make_current=True` with an existing `IOLoop` instance is incorrect.

## Cause:
The bug is caused because the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case where a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. It incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of handling this scenario more gracefully.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case of creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case of creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` even when there is already a current instance, and pass the failing test.
