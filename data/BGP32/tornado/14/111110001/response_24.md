### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether there is a current `IOLoop` instance and sets it as the current instance if needed.
2. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set it as the current instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance.
3. The bug occurs when the test tries to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` because a current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current=True` is passed to a new instance.

### Bug Fix:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By checking for the current instance at the beginning of the function and then handling the `make_current` logic accordingly, we can prevent the error that occurs when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.
