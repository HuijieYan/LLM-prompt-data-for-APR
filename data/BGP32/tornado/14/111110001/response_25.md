### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class from `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The `initialize` function is responsible for initializing an instance of the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional `make_current` argument.
3. The failure occurs in the test `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`:
    - The test tries to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, expecting the current `IOLoop` instance to be set.
    - The test then tries to create a second instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` since a second current `IOLoop` instance cannot exist.
    - The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The bug is due to the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if `IOLoop.current` instance is not None before setting it as the current instance. This check is causing the `RuntimeError` in the test case when trying to make the second instance current.
5. To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and not check if the current instance already exists.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will only check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that a second attempt to make an `IOLoop` instance current will raise the `RuntimeError` as desired in the test case.
