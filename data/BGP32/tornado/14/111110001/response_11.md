### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. This function is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object and making it current if required.
2. The buggy function is called with `make_current=True` in the failing test.
3. The buggy function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, it should raise an error. However, the current implementation is raising an error if there is no instance, leading to a false positive.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check for an existing current instance only when `make_current` is `True`.
5. The corrected version of the buggy function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This will fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
