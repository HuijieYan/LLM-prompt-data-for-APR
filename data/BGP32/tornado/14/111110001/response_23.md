## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class which is used to initialize an instance of `IOLoop`.
2. The function takes an optional argument `make_current` which controls whether the current `IOLoop` should be set as the current one.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed, and the function checks if the current `IOLoop` already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which is the expected behavior according to the test function provided.
4. The bug is that the function should not raise an error if `make_current=True` when there is already a current `IOLoop`. Instead, it should simply set the current `IOLoop` without raising an error.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block for `make_current=True` to set the current `IOLoop` without raising an error if it already exists.

## Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        # No need to raise an error if current IOLoop already exists
```
