Potential Error Locations:
1. The `initialize()` function in the `IOLoop` class is expecting a parameter `make_current`, but it's not properly handling the case where `make_current` is `True`.
2. The issue is with the logic inside the `initialize()` function when `make_current=True` is passed. The function should check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` before attempting to make the current instance.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize()` function, it doesn't properly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. As a result, it tries to make the current instance without checking, leading to the RuntimeError when there is already an existing instance.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic inside the `initialize()` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True`. Specifically, we should first check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` before attempting to make the current instance.

Corrected Version of the `initialize()` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `initialize()` function now properly checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` before attempting to make it the current instance. This should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass.
