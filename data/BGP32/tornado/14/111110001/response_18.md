### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and trying to make itself the current instance based on the input argument `make_current`.
2. The error message indicates that the bug is happening when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize()` function.
3. The bug is caused because when `make_current=True`, the function is raising an error if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but it should instead become the current instance.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the behavior of the `initialize()` function to make the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` is provided as an argument.

### Updated Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.__class__._instance = self
``` 

With this correction, when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize()` function:
- If there is no current `IOLoop` instance, the function makes itself the current instance.
- If there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, the function will set itself as the current instance.
