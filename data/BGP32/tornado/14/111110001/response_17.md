### Analyzing the Buggy Function

The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class is `initialize(self, make_current=None)`. This function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object and handling the logic related to making the IOLoop object the current one.

The test function `test_force_current` from the `IOLoop` class tests the `make_current=True` initialization behavior. It expects that calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.

### Identified Bug

The bug in the `initialize` function arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already a current IOLoop instance. The bug is triggered when the `initialize` function tries to make the IOLoop object current without checking if a current IOLoop already exists.

### Cause of the Bug

1. When `make_current` is `True`, the `initialize` function checks if a current IOLoop instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
   
2. If there is no current IOLoop instance, it proceeds to make the IOLoop instance current.
   
3. However, if there is already a current instance, instead of raising an error, it mistakenly proceeds to make the IOLoop object current again.
   
4. This leads to the situation where there are multiple current IOLoop instances, which is incorrect behavior.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists. We should raise a `RuntimeError` as specified in the test case when trying to make an additional IOLoop instance current.

### Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, we first check if a current instance already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we proceed to make the IOLoop instance current.
