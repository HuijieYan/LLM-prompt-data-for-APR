## Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop.py` module.
- The `initialize` method is designed to initialize the IOLoop object with an optional argument `make_current`.
- The test function `test_force_current` in `tornado.test.ioloop_test.py` tries to create a current `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if there is already a current instance.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised during the test execution.

## Identified Issue:
- The issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` method where the check for an existing current instance is causing the problem.
- The current logic does not handle the case where `make_current=True` is specified and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
 
## Bug Cause:
- When `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` method, the function should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- The current implementation only checks if `make_current=True` and another `IOLoop` instance exists, but it does not handle the case where an existing `IOLoop` instance is already the current one.

## Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is True and current_ioloop is not None and current_ioloop is not self:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # This is to handle the case make_current is explicitly set to True
        self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustments above, the corrected `initialize` method should properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This modification ensures that the `RuntimeError` will be raised only if there is a conflicting current instance.
