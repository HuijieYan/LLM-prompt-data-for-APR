### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance and manage the current `IOLoop`. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an instance with `make_current=True` and then check if it becomes the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs because while creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is caused by a logic error in the `initialize` function where the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. It should allow the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` even if there is already a current instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. 
5. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function that addresses the bug:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By ensuring that the check for the current `IOLoop` is done correctly for the case when `make_current=True`, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test.
