### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize()` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The `initialize()` function checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and makes the current instance if needed.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set it as the current instance. The test then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as the current instance already exists. The error message confirms that the second creation attempt is failing as expected.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic that checks if a current `IOLoop` already exists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check for an existing current `IOLoop` is correct and that the behavior when `make_current` is `True` works as intended.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional logic in the `initialize()` function to correctly handle the cases where a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not.
2. When `make_current=True` is passed to initialize, ensure that it raises an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional logic to raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` while a current instance already exists, the corrected version of the `initialize()` function should now pass the failing test.
