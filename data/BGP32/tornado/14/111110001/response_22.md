### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize()` within the `IOLoop` class. 
2. The test function `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to become the current `IOLoop`, raising a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The buggy function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and should throw an error if `make_current=True` and a current instance is already present. The error message indicates that the problem lies in the logic of throwing the `RuntimeError`.
4. The issue may be in the condition where it checks for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.
5. To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize()` function within the `IOLoop` class:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check for a current instance of `IOLoop`. Then, based on the `make_current` parameter, we either make the current instance or raise an error if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. This adjustment should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
