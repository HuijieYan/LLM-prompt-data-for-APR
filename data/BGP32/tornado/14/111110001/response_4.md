## Analyzing the buggy function and the failing test:

1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance with an option to make it the current instance if `make_current=True` is passed. It checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and then either makes the new instance the current one or raises an error if there is already a current instance.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. It then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` because a second attempt at making the same `IOLoop` instance the current one should fail.

3. The error occurs because in the buggy function `initialize`, when `make_current` is True, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, in this case, the new `IOLoop` instance that is being created is intended to become the current one, so the check should actually verify if there is no current instance instead of checking if there is one.

4. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to allow creating a new current instance when `make_current=True` is passed, as long as there is no existing current instance. If there is already a current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as before.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function now correctly checks for the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance the current one.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
