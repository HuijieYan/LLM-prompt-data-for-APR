### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is designed to set up the IOLoop with an optional argument `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then makes itself the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if so.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if it becomes the current IOLoop instance. It then tries to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to fail with a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the second attempt to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` is failing with a `RuntimeError` because the current IOLoop instance already exists.
4. The bug is present in the logic of the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before setting itself as the current instance.
5. To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should always set itself as the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True`, regardless of the current state.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()  # Always attempt to set this IOLoop as current
```
