### Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize an IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current instance. The problem arises when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument to `initialize`, and the function checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Potential error locations:
1. Checking for a current IOLoop instance.
2. Handling the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

### Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`. The function first checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` (whether another IOLoop instance already exists). If there is no current instance, it calls `self.make_current()` to make the new instance the current one. However, when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, the function should ideally raise an error. But the current implementation incorrectly checks if a current instance does not exist and then raises an error if `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check when `make_current=True`:
- If a current instance already exists, raise an error immediately.
- If no current instance exists, proceed to make the new instance the current one.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, we ensure that if `make_current=True` is passed and a current instance exists, it will raise an error as expected.
