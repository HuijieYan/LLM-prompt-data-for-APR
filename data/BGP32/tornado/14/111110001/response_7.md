## Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance in two scenarios: when `make_current` is `None` and when `make_current` is `True`.
- The issue arises when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, causing the function to raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects the instance to become the current `IOLoop`, and then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused when the `initialize` function raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- This behavior is not aligned with the expected behavior from the failing test, leading to a test failure.

## Fix Strategy:
- In order to fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- We should modify the logic in such a way that if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, the function will simply return without raising a `RuntimeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
