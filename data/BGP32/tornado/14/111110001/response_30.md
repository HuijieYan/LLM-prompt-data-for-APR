## Bug Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but there is a bug in the logic that checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, causing the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance to always fail because it does not consider the case where the instance is already set.
  
## Bug Explanation:
1. In the `initialize` function, when `make_current=True` is passed, the code checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that a current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. However, this check fails because `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` will always return `None` since the `current` function does not set the instance unless explicitly specified.
3. As a result, the code incorrectly raises the `RuntimeError`, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Fix:
1. To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed.
2. We need to modify the logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set before attempting to set it again.

## Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
