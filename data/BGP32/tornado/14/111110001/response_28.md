### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists before making itself current based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The `make_current` parameter is used to determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be forced to be the current one.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the newly created one.
4. The failing test expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance when there is already a current instance, but the actual bug causes the error message to be raised prematurely.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the premature handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The logic is incorrect, as it triggers the `RuntimeError` before checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rearrange the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current=True` and then verify if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. If there is a current instance and `make_current=True`, raise the `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, proceed to make the current instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By reordering the `if-elif` conditions and modifying the logic inside them, we ensure that the correct checks are performed before raising the `RuntimeError`. This corrected version should now pass the failing test.
