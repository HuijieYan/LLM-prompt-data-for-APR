## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. It takes an optional argument `make_current`, which controls whether the new IOLoop instance should try to become the current one.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The current implementation raises a `RuntimeError` in this case.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when a second attempt is made to make it the current instance.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. It checks if there is no current instance before making the new instance current, but when `make_current=True`, it should always attempt to make the new instance the current one.
   
## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should make sure that when `make_current=True`, the function always tries to become the current `IOLoop` instance, regardless of the existence of a current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function with the bug fixed
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        return
    
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            
    self.make_current()
```
