The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method is designed to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance, which includes setting it as the current instance if needed. The bug arises when the `make_current` argument is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the method checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is one, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
- The failing test tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which makes the `initialize` method check for an existing current instance, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, the method should proceed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the error is only raised when trying to make a new instance current while there is already a current instance.

This corrected version of the `initialize` method should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass without any `RuntimeError`.
