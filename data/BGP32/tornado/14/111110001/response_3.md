### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The function is supposed to initialize an IOLoop object and make it the current IOLoop if needed.
3. The buggy function checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` is passed and a current IOLoop already exists.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True` twice and expects the second attempt to fail with a `RuntimeError`.
5. The failing test raises a `RuntimeError` at the assertion point where the second construction with `make_current=True` is verified.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function incorrectly checks if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current=True`. It should allow the second instance creation to fail only if `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` so that it only raises the error if `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version of `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # Handle other cases for make_current
        pass
```

By correcting the condition `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current is True:`, the bug will be fixed and the `initialize` function should work as expected.
