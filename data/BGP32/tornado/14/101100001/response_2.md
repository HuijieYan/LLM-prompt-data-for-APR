## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue where it doesn't handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It always goes into the `elif` block and checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before making the current IOLoop. This causes the test function `test_force_current` to fail because it expects an exception to be raised when trying to create a second IOLoop with `make_current=True`.

## Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. It should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current IOLoop present before attempting to make the current IOLoop.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the `initialize` function to correctly check if there is already a current IOLoop when `make_current` is set to `True`.
- Raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current IOLoop available before attempting to set it as the current IOLoop.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the `test_force_current` function should pass as expected.
