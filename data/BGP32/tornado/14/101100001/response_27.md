## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop`. The bug seems to be related to how the `make_current` argument is handled in the function. The `make_current` argument should control whether the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be set as the current one.

The current implementation of the `initialize` function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` based on the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. This logic is flawed, as `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns the class itself and not the instance. This is leading to incorrect behavior when checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

## Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the incorrect comparison to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, leading to unexpected behavior when setting the current `IOLoop`.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to correctly determine if the current `IOLoop` instance exists by checking if it is already set.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` argument controls whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be set in the initialization process.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the comparison in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:` ensures that we are correctly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set to the current instance. This change should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
