## Correction:

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not properly handling the case where `make_current=True` is passed. The issue arises from the condition checking in the `initialize` function.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation of changes made:
1. Removed the extra `elif make_current` condition and replaced it with just `else`.
2. Changed the check for `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

By implementing these changes, the `initialize` function will now properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` is passed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
