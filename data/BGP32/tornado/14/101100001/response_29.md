## Correction:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

## Explanation:
- The bug in the original `initialize` function was that it wasn't checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already existed before trying to make one current with `self.make_current()`.
- The corrected version checks if a current `IOLoop` instance is None before calling `self.make_current()`. If a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` as intended.
- By making these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function ensures that a new `IOLoop` instance is only made current when necessary, passing the failing test scenario.
