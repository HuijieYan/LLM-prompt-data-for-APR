## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter.
2. The function is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter, but it's not functioning as expected.
3. The test function `test_force_current` is designed to ensure that attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when an existing instance is already set should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug seems to be in the conditional logic of the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if `IOLoop.current` is `None` and raises an error in the wrong scenario.
  
## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True` is attempted.
2. Ensure that the correct flow is followed to set the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After applying the above correction to the `initialize` function, the test function `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
