The issue in the buggy function lies in the `initialize` method where the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is not correctly implemented. The bug occurs when attempting to create a new current IOLoop instance while one already exists (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`), resulting in a `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `initialize` method to check if there is already a current IOLoop instance before trying to make the current one. If there is an existing current instance, we should set `make_current` to `False` and not raise an error. If there is no current instance, we should proceed to make the current one.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if current_instance is not None:
            make_current = False
        elif make_current:  # If make_current is explicitly set to True
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` method as shown above, it should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and avoid raising a `RuntimeError` when unnecessary. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
