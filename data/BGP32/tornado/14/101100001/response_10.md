## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and sets the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The buggy part of the code is in the `initialize` function where it checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance if no current instance exists. However, there is an issue with handling the case where a current instance already exists.
3. The failing test case `test_force_current` expects that attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance when one already exists will raise a `RuntimeError`, but the buggy code does not handle this case correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function. If a current instance exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, otherwise, it should set the current instance.
5. The corrected code is provided below:

## Corrected version

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition in the `initialize` function to check if a current instance already exists when `make_current=True`, we ensure that attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance when one already exists raises a `RuntimeError`, passing the failing test case.
