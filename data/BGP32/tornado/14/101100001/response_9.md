## Correction:

The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the way it handles the `make_current` parameter. The current logic in the `initialize` function does not correctly check if an IOLoop instance is already existing before trying to make it current. This causes the bug where the RuntimeError is not raised when it should be.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to properly check if an existing IOLoop instance is already set as current before trying to make it current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic as shown above, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance is already set as current.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
