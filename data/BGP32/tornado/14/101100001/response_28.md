The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class lies in the condition where it checks if `make_current` is not provided. If `make_current` is not provided, the function should make the current `IOLoop`, but the implementation does not handle this correctly.

The buggy function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is not provided (i.e., `make_current=None`). It should create the current `IOLoop` if one does not already exist. However, the implementation does not correctly check the condition and instead goes directly to `self.make_current()`. Additionally, the logic within the `if` conditions is not consistent regarding the `make_current` parameter.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to first check if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, create the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is provided and `True`, it should raise an exception if the current `IOLoop` already exists. Lastly, regardless of the conditions, it should call `self.make_current()` to set the current `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
