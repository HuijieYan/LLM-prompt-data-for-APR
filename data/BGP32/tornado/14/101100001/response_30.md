## Correction:

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, I have identified the potential error location which is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail because the `initialize` function is not handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True` correctly.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic of the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should check if an IOLoop instance is already the current one and raise a `RuntimeError` if that is the case. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
