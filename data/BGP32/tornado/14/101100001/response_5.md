The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail. The issue arises from the logic in the `initialize` function where the condition `elif make_current:` is not handling the case where `make_current` is `True`, which is causing the RuntimeError to not be raised when it should.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
