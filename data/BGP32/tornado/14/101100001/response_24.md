The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic used to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly checking for None to identify the absence of an instance, which leads to an incorrect condition evaluation.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists based on whether the `make_current` argument is provided or not. The condition should check if the current instance is not None to determine if the `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change in the `initialize` function, the test function `test_force_current` should now pass successfully.
