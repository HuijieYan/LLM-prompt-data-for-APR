## Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current one if it does not already exist.
- The buggy part of the function is the handling of the `make_current` argument.
- The test function `test_force_current` checks if the `IOLoop` instance is correctly set as the current one and verifies that trying to create a second current `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Explanation:
- The bug is in the `initialize` function where it does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`, resulting in a `RuntimeError` when there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where `make_current=True` to correctly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, raise a `RuntimeError`; otherwise, set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
