## Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
- The bug arises from not correctly handling the check for an already existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test for the `test_force_current` function, the buggy function `initialize` fails to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly in the buggy function.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function correctly checks if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to create a new one.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class should now handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` correctly, avoiding the erroneous `RuntimeError` in the failing test.
