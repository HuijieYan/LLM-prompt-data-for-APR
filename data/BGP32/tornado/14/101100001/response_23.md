## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is checking if `make_current` is None, and then checking if the current IOLoop instance is None before calling `self.make_current()`.
2. The `test_force_current` test function is trying to test the scenario where `make_current` is True and `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The buggy function fails to handle the case where `make_current` is True and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the case where `make_current` is True and the `IOLoop` instance already exists. The buggy function does not prevent the creation of a second `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is True and an `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new instance.
2. Modify the logic to handle the case where `make_current` is True and an `IOLoop` instance is already present.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None when `make_current` is True, we ensure that only one `IOLoop` instance is created when `make_current` is True and one does not already exist.
