## Corrections to the buggy function

The issue with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it does not handle the case where `make_current` is passed as `True` correctly. It should raise a `RuntimeError` if an attempt is made to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

## Explanation of the bug and Fix

In the original `initialize` function, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` was used in both the cases, which was incorrect. In the case where `make_current=True`, the condition should check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists (checking if it's not `None`) and raise a `RuntimeError` in that scenario.

The corrected version ensures that a `RuntimeError` is raised if an attempt is made to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an existing `IOLoop` instance is already present.

With this correction, the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
