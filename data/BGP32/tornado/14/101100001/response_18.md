The bug in the `initialize` function is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. The function is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, ensuring that only one instance can be created at a time.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`, but the current implementation does not do that. Instead, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised immediately without calling `self.make_current()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` argument correctly and pass the failing test provided.
