## Analyzing the buggy function and related functions:

1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance.
2. It checks if a current instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
3. If `make_current` argument is not provided, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current instance.
4. If `make_current` is provided and evaluates to True, it checks for an existing current instance and raises an error if found.
5. The `IOLoop.current` method is used to get the current IOLoop instance.

## Identified issue:

The issue in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed as an argument. It should raise an error only if a current instance already exists and `make_current=True`. But the current implementation raises an error if a current instance does not exist.

## Strategy to fix the bug:

1. Modify the `initialize` function to check for the existence of a current instance before attempting to make the current instance.
2. Raise an error only if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.
3. Update the logic to correctly handle the initialization based on the provided arguments.

## Corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Now, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should handle the test case provided and pass the failing test.
