### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance present or not.
2. The issue arises when the `make_current=True` argument is passed while initializing a new `IOLoop` instance.
3. The buggy function checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make the current instance using `self.make_current()`. If there is already a current instance and `make_current=True`, it should raise an error.
4. The error message indicates that the error occurs when trying to raise an error message for an already existing `IOLoop` instance.
5. The GitHub issue suggests a discrepancy in the logic around checking for the current `IOLoop` instance and the error message being raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize()` function not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise an error without trying to make the instance current again.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above change in the `initialize()` function, the bug should be fixed and the error message related to the current `IOLoop` instance should be resolved.
