### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is already a current instance and makes itself the current instance if not. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is.
   
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, the function is trying to raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, it should only proceed to make itself the current instance if there is no current instance already. The error occurs because it is mistakenly raising an error even if there is no current `IOLoop`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

### Fixed Buggy Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing class functions

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
- The fixed function checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before raising an error when `make_current=True`.
- It stores the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance` variable to avoid repeated calls.
- We now ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `current_instance` is not `None` when `make_current=True`.

This fix should resolve the issue and allow the corrected function to work as expected.
