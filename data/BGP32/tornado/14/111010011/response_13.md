### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.
3. The bug is causing the error message "current IOLoop already exists" to be raised when it shouldn't be raised according to the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, then raise `RuntimeError`.
2. Remove the unnecessary check in the `if make_current is None` block.
3. Ensure that `make_current` argument behaves as expected according to the class documentation.
4. Update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` argument.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By applying the above bug fix strategy and correcting the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be resolved and the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
