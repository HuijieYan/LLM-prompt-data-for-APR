### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current instance of the IOLoop. It has two conditions: if `make_current` is not provided, it sets the current instance only if it doesn't exist already. If `make_current` is `True`, it tries to set the current instance forcefully.
2. The failing test shows that when `make_current` is `True`, but the current IOLoop instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is raising an error when it should not because the current IOLoop instance exists.
4. To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists, without raising an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance exists, simply do nothing and continue without raising an error.
2. Modify the `initialize` function to reflect the above logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: # Check if current instance exists
            return  # Do nothing if current instance already exists
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, without raising an error.
