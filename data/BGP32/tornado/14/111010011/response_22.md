### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if there is a current `IOLoop` instance present before making the current instance. If `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, which triggers the check for the current instance. The check fails because the test environment already has a current `IOLoop` instance present.
3. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is contradictory to the condition check that assumes it should be None.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect handling of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance present. The condition check in the `initialize` function is not properly handling this scenario, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
Modify the condition check for `make_current=True` to properly handle the case where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. If `make_current=True` and there is an existing current instance, do not raise an error. Only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()
```
