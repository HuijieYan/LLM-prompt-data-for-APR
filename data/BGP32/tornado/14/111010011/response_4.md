### 1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class checks the `make_current` argument and the current instance of the `IOLoop` to determine whether to make the current instance.
- The error message indicates that the `initialize()` function is erroneously raising a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, which is contradictory.
- The GitHub issue highlights the confusion regarding the condition in line 252 of `ioloop.py`.

### 2. Error Location:
- The issue lies in the `if make_current is None` block of the `initialize()` function where the check for a current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect.

### 3. Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the misinterpretation of the conditional check in the `initialize()` function.
- When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which implies no current instance exists, but then it mistakenly attempts to make the current instance.
- This inconsistency results in the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### 4. Fix Strategy:
- To resolve the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize()` function.
- The proper approach is to only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
- We should avoid triggering the error if no current instance exists when `make_current` is `None`.

### 5. Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that the `initialize()` function correctly handles the `make_current` argument and avoids raising unnecessary errors when dealing with the current `IOLoop` instance.
