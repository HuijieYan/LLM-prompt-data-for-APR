### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `initialize` is a method in the `IOLoop` class.
   - The `initialize` method calls the `current` and `make_current` methods from the same class.

2. **Potential Error Locations**:
   - The issue seems to be with how the `initialize` method is handling the `make_current` parameter.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the IOLoop instance.
   - The bug occurs when `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   - The bug is triggered at the line `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`.
   - The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked incorrectly.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - We need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   - We should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True` and still proceed without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version will handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists without raising an error.
