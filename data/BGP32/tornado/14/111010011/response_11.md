### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None or not before deciding whether to make the current IOLoop or raise an error.
2. The failing test error message indicates that the current IOLoop instance is not None even though `make_current` is True, leading to the error being raised that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 (which corresponds to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`), as it seems contradictory to raise an error when the condition is met.
4. The error is due to the logic in the `if` condition at line 252, which is incorrectly raising an error when it should not.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, modify the conditions to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. 

### The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, the bug is fixed. This change ensures that the error is only raised when the current IOLoop instance exists and `make_current` is True.
