## Fixing the Bug:

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks the existing instance of `IOLoop` using the `IOLoop.current` function with `instance=False` parameter.
2. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is currently no `IOLoop` instance present, then it calls `make_current` to make the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is provided and it evaluates to `True`, it should raise an error if there is an existing `IOLoop` instance already.
4. The error message "current IOLoop already exists" indicates that the exception is raised incorrectly.
5. The test that is failing is attempting to force the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance even if there is one already present.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the conditional check in the `else` part of the `initialize` function is incorrect.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` should check if `make_current` is `True` and not just a truthy value.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition in the `initialize` function to explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` instead of just checking if it is truthy.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Explicitly check if make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for an existing instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this change, the function should properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, and only raise an error if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance during that scenario. This correction should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the test to pass successfully.
