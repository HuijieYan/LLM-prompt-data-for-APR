### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` in the `IOLoop` class is currently checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, it is trying to make the current instance. However, there is a logical error in the code that is causing it to incorrectly raise an error when the current instance is indeed None.
   
2. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method is used to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance without attempting to create one.

3. The buggy function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when it should be handling the case where there is no current instance. This behavior contradicts the intended logic of the function as described in the class documentation.

4. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current` is True, and if so, only then check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, raise the `RuntimeError` with the existing error message.
2. If `make_current` is not True, there is no need to check for an existing current instance; instead, directly call the `self.make_current()` method.
3. This revised logic will ensure that the function behaves correctly in both cases - when a current instance exists and when it doesn't.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing the above corrections to the `initialize` function, it will now correctly handle the scenario where there is no current `IOLoop` instance without raising an error unnecessarily.
