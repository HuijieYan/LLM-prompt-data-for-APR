### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance. It checks if there is a current IOLoop instance and based on the `make_current` parameter behavior, either becomes the current IOLoop or raises an error if a current IOLoop already exists.
   
2. The error message indicates that the bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and it mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` even when a current IOLoop instance does not exist.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is inside the block that checks for `make_current`, but it should be outside this block to correctly handle the scenario where a current IOLoop instance does not exist.

4. To fix this bug, we need to move the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` outside of the `elif make_current:` block.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if no current IOLoop instance exists
            if make_current is None:
                self.make_current()
            elif make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In this corrected version, we first check if there is no current IOLoop instance before deciding whether to make the current IOLoop or raise an error based on the `make_current` parameter. This ensures that the correct behavior is followed regardless of the `make_current` value.
