### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the initialization of the IOLoop instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, the code checks if the current IOLoop is `None` and then tries to set it as current, but if it is not `None` it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The issue on GitHub suggests a confusion in the logic at line 252, where it is checking if the current IOLoop is `None` and then raising an error if it is not `None`. This seems inconsistent.
4. The bug can be fixed by updating the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop already exists, without raising an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current=True` and then verify if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before setting it as current.
2. If the current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True` is specified, simply keep it as is without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                return  # Current IOLoop already exists, no need to proceed
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the initialization logic for the IOLoop instance without raising any errors when the current IOLoop instance already exists.
