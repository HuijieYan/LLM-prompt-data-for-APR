### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the logic for making the current `IOLoop` instance, ensuring that only one `IOLoop` instance exists at a time.
2. The error message indicates that the exception `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` even though it is expected to raise an exception only if the result is not `None`.
3. The root cause of the bug is that the conditional check for `make_current` in the `initialize` function is inaccurate, leading to the incorrect raising of the error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements for handling the `make_current` parameter and the `current` instance check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the value of `make_current` and only raise an error if it is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Remove the unnecessary check for `make_current is None` and directly check the condition for `make_current`.
3. Properly handle the condition where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` to avoid the erroneous error raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The fixed version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In this corrected version, the conditional logic correctly checks if `make_current` is `True` and if a current instance already exists. Only in that case, the `RuntimeError` is raised. This adjustment ensures that the error is thrown as expected when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance when the current already exists.

By making this fix, the error described in the failing test and the GitHub issue will be resolved, and the behavior of the `initialize` function will align with the intended logic of the `IOLoop` class.
