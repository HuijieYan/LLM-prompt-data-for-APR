### Analyzing the Bug

1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**: The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class. The function is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance with the option to force it to become the current instance. The function checks whether there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and acts accordingly.

2. **Error Location within the Buggy Function**:
   - The error is likely occurring in the `initialize` function when it checks if a current `IOLoop` exists before making the new `IOLoop` instance the current one.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The issue arises from the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`. When this condition is true, it means that there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, later in the code, when the condition `if make_current:` is encountered, it fails because the code incorrectly assumes that a current `IOLoop` already exists due to the previous condition, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic in the `initialize` function properly handles the case when there is no current `IOLoop` instance. This involves reorganizing the conditional statements to accurately determine if the new `IOLoop` instance should be made the current one.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

### Changes Made:
1. Reorganized the conditional statements to check for the `make_current` parameter first.
2. When `make_current` is True, check if a current `IOLoop` doesn't already exist before making the new one the current instance.
3. When `make_current` is False (or None), ensure that the new `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one if there is no existing current instance.

By applying these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance correctly and pass the failing test.
