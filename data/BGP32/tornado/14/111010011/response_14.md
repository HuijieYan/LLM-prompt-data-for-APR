### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked twice.
2. The logic for checking the `make_current` parameter and the existing current `IOLoop` instance needs to be reviewed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because there is a discrepancy in the logic of the `initialize` function. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, but then raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that it already exists. This error is triggered when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic in the `initialize` function is consistent and correct. The condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` should be in line with the error message that is raised when it is found to be `None`. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter also needs to be adjusted based on the desired behavior.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `not None` has been added before raising the `RuntimeError`.
- The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter has been adjusted to ensure that the correct error message is raised based on the presence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
