### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` within the `IOLoop` class has a conditional check where if `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an instance of the `IOLoop` already exists by calling the `current` method with `instance=False`. If an instance is found, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying the current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, triggering the condition where it checks if the current instance is `None` or not, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised.
3. The error occurs due to the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is `True` and checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is found.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix the condition here
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, the logic will correctly determine if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make it current.
