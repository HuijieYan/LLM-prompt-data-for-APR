### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before setting the current instance. 
2. The issue occurs when `make_current=True`, but there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.
3. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, it checks for an existing `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if it exists, which contradicts the expected behavior as per the error message.
4. The bug is in the logic of the `initialize` function where the condition for checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists is not correctly handled.
5. The bug can be fixed by updating the logic to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current=True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.
2. Modify the code to check the existence of an `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`.
3. If `make_current=True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance, then no new instance should be created and an error should be raised.
4. If `make_current` is not specified, continue with the default behavior of setting the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will now appropriately handle the scenario for creating a new `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`.
