## Analyzing the buggy function and its related components

The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object. In this function, if `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function. If no current instance exists, it tries to make the current instance by calling `self.make_current()`. However, if a current instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

The related functions are `current()` and `make_current()` within the `IOLoop` class, where `current()` is used to obtain the current instance of `IOLoop` and `make_current()` is used to set the current instance.

The error message indicates that the test case is trying to force the current instance of `IOLoop` to be set as the current one even though it already exists, triggering the `RuntimeError`.

The GitHub issue questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

## Identifying the bug
The bug lies in the condition where `make_current` is set to `True`, and the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. In this case, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even though the current instance is not `None`.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional check when `make_current` is set to `True`. We should check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current` is set to `True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
