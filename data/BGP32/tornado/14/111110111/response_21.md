### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is expecting a `make_current` parameter to control whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be created or not. The issue arises when trying to create a new current `IOLoop` instance when one already exists.
2. The error occurs in the `initialize` function where it checks if a current instance already exists and raises an error based on the value of `make_current`.
3. The bug is caused by the logic inconsistency in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error even if `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to differentiate between creating a new current `IOLoop` instance and handling scenarios where one already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current is True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. If `make_current` is not provided or is `False`, simply create a new current `IOLoop` instance without checking for the existence of an existing one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Make the current instance
    else:
        self.make_current()  # Make the current instance
```
