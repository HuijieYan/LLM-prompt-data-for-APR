### Bug Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the logic seems to be flawed as it throws a `RuntimeError` even if no current instance is found.
   
### Bug Location:
- The issue lies in the `initialize` function when checking for an existing instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. The condition for raising `RuntimeError` is not correctly handling the case when no current instance exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `initialize` function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no existing instance of `IOLoop`. This behavior is in contrast to the expected behavior specified in the failing test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to correctly identify when to raise a `RuntimeError` based on the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` block, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing instance of `IOLoop`. This modification aligns the behavior of the function with the expected outcomes.
