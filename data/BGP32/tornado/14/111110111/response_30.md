The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is causing the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly when `make_current` is `True`. The problem arises because even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the function still tries to raise the RuntimeError.

The root cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is flawed. It should only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is `True` and if an existing `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the presence of an existing `IOLoop` instance only when `make_current` is `True`. If no existing instance is found, then the new instance should be marked as the current one.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, the function will now correctly raise the RuntimeError only when there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `test_force_current` test case passes successfully.
