To fix the bug in the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class, we need to ensure that the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is correctly handled before attempting to make the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
1. We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the `current_instance`.
2. Then, we check if `make_current` is `None`. If it is, we check if `current_instance` is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if `current_instance` is not `None` before raising an error. This ensures that we don't attempt to make the current instance if it already exists.

With this corrected version of the function, it should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and correctly handle the scenario where an `IOLoop` instance should be made current without causing an error if it already exists.
