### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. If there is none, it sets the current `IOLoop` instance. However, if there is already a current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current` to `True`, creates an `IOLoop` instance, and then tries to create another one with `make_current` set to `True` also. This second creation should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the issue occurs in the `initialize` function, specifically when trying to make the `IOLoop` current when it is already present.
   
### Bug Explanation
1. The bug arises from the fact that when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if there is an existing current `IOLoop`, the `initialize` function does not correctly handle this scenario. It raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is misleading.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
1. To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance is already the current one.
   
### Corrected Function
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            existing_current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if existing_current is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            existing_current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if existing_current is None:
                self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the logic to first check for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set it again, the corrected function ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when appropriate, fixing the bug.
