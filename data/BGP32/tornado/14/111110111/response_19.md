## Identified Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class arises when the `make_current` argument is set to `True` and there is an existing instance of `IOLoop`. In this case, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

## Cause of the Bug:
1. In the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `True`, the code first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it is `None`, it proceeds to raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. This behavior contradicts the logic that should be followed when `make_current` is `True. The intention should be to make the given `IOLoop` instance as the current instance, rather than checking for a potentially existing one.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True`. Instead of checking for an existing current `IOLoop`, we simply need to make the current instance the one provided in the argument `make_current`.

## Corrected Code:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()  # Make the provided instance the current instance
```

By removing the unnecessary check for an existing current instance in the case where `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the intended behavior of setting the given instance as the current one is achieved. This fix will address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the function behave as expected in the failing test case.
