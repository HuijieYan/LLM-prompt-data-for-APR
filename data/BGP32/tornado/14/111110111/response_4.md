The issue in the buggy function `initialize` lies in the section where it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`. The logic is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even if no current `IOLoop` instance is present.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # Ensuring at least one current IOLoop is present
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these modifications, the corrected function will handle the scenario correctly where there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when needed.

This corrected version should pass the failing test with the expected input/output values provided.
