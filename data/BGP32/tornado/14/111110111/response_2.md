## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This behavior is incorrect as the check for an existing `IOLoop` should only be triggered if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

In the failing test case provided:
1. The `IOLoop` instance is initialized with `make_current=True`.
2. The test asserts that the initialized `IOLoop` instance should be the current instance (`IOLoop.current()`).
3. The test then attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

However, the buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop` instance, leading to the test failure.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current instance but `make_current` is `True`, then the current instance should be set to the newly created `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` block, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the current instance is set to the newly created `IOLoop`.
