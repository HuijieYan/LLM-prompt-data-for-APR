### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if specified. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and if not, it calls the `make_current` function to make the new instance current. If `make_current` is `True`, it throws a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `IOLoopTest` class tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current instance is the newly created one. It expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True` if there is already a current instance.

3. The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the logic in the `elif` block when `make_current` is `True`. The function should only raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, but it is incorrectly raising an error even when there is no current instance.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `elif` block of the `initialize` function to correctly check if there is already a current instance before deciding to make the new instance current.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the `elif` block of the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, otherwise, proceed to make the new instance current.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and it will only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
