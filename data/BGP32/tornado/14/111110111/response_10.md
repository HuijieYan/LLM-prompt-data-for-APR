### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` argument is `None`. If it is `None`, it verifies that there is no current `IOLoop` instance by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then sets the current instance if needed by calling `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if so, raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True`, the provided `IOLoop` instance should become the current instance, and any subsequent attempt to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should fail with a `RuntimeError`.
4. The error message shows that the second attempt to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is raising a `RuntimeError` indicating that a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function when checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. Even though a current `IOLoop` instance is checked and set correctly for the first instance created with `make_current=True`, the subsequent check fails to recognize that a current instance already exists and tries to set it again, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle scenarios where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should modify the conditions under which we set the current instance based on the value of the `make_current` argument.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            return  # Added to prevent further execution in this branch
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

By adding `return` after setting the current instance when `make_current` is `None`, and adjusting the condition to check if the current instance is not `None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the logic handles the existing current instance correctly. This change should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
