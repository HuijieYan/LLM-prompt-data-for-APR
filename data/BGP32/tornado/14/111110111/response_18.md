## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter, it should raise an error if a current instance is already present, but it fails to do so.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is not raised as expected when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The expected input for the failing test is a `True` value for the `make_current` parameter.

## Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs due to the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The check for the existence of the current instance is not being evaluated correctly.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. We need to raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the check for raising a `RuntimeError` is inverted to ensure that if `make_current=True` and a current instance is already present, the error is raised as expected.
