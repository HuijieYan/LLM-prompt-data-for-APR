## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in class `IOLoop` takes a parameter `make_current` with a default value of `None`.
2. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is not `None`, it further checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects that it becomes the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Error
The error occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`. The function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, but due to the way the `IOLoop.current` function is called within the `initialize` function, it always tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance even if it's already set. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only set the current `IOLoop` instance if it is not already set. We can directly call `IOLoop.current()` without setting the instance parameter and check if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing functions unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected `initialize` function will correctly handle setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the provided `make_current` parameter value.

This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test `test_force_current` to pass as expected.
