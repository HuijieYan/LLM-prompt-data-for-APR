### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is True and there is no current instance, it sets the `IOLoop` instance as the current one. However, if `make_current` is True and a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test is checking if creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` correctly sets it as the current instance and prevents the creation of a new instance if one already exists.
3. The failing behavior is due to the fact that when `make_current` is True, the current instance check should be for existence not None, but the comparison is incorrectly checking for None, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the comparison logic in the condition that checks for an existing current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition that checks for an existing current instance when `make_current=True` to check if an instance exists rather than explicitly checking for None.
2. Update the logic to handle the case where a new `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, and a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Fixed version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Check if an instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if an instance is not None when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the correct existing instance handling is done, preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised when it shouldn't be. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the issue raised on GitHub.
