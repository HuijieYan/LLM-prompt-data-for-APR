## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for ensuring that only one instance of the `IOLoop` exists if `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised, even though the current `IOLoop` does not exist.
3. The bug causes the test `test_force_current` to fail because it expects the `RuntimeError` to be raised only if a current `IOLoop` already exists but incorrectly triggers the error due to the condition checking in the `initialize` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to match the intended logic. We need to differentiate between cases where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` does not exist from cases where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function correctly handles the scenario where `make_current` is `True`. The modified conditional checks now ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to make a new `IOLoop` current when one already exists.
