The issue in the buggy function `initialize` arises from the logic used to check whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The function is meant to initialize the `IOLoop` object with an optional parameter `make_current`, where:
- If `make_current` is `None`, and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it should make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True`, and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it should make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True`, and there is already an existing instance of `IOLoop`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that a current `IOLoop` already exists, which is contradictory. This discrepancy stems from the way the logic is structured.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, the function will now behave as expected. It will raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing instance of `IOLoop`. This correction should resolve the failing test case and align with the expected behavior of the function.
