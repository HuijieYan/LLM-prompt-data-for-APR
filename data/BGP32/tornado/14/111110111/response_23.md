The bug in the `initialize` function arises because the logic for checking if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` is incorrect. The intention of the function is to prevent creating a new instance with `make_current=True` if there is already an existing current instance. However, the current implementation does not handle this situation properly, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly determine if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. One way to achieve this is by checking if the current instance is not `None` and the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. If both conditions are met, then raise the `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This adjustment ensures that a `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` when attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

With this fix, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
