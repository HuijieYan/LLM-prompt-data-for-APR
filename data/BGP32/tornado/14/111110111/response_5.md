To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to update the conditional logic to accurately check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. The bug is caused when attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when there is already an existing current instance. The code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in this case.

To address this issue, we can modify the `initialize` function by first checking if `make_current` is `True`. If it is `True`, we should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and only then raise the `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make a new one current with `make_current=True`.

This fixed version should pass the failing test provided.
