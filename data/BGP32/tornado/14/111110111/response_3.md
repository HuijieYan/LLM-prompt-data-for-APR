## Fixing the bug

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the bug checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If one does not exist (`IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`), it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. If no current `IOLoop` instance exists, we should proceed to make the current instance. If an instance already exists, we should handle it by not raising an error but rather making it the current instance.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_io_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_io_loop is not None:
            # If a current instance already exists, make it the current instance
            current_io_loop.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustments above, we ensure that the behavior matches the intended logic and resolves the issue identified in the GitHub report.
