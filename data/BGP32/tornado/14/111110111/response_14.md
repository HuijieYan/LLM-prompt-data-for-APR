## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of an instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug arises when `make_current` is set to `True`. The buggy logic checks if there is already a current instance, and if not, it attempts to set the current instance using `self.make_current()`. If there is already a current instance, it still calls `self.make_current()`, which leads to the RuntimeError.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True`, a new instance is created and set as the current instance, but if there is already a current instance, a RuntimeError is raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only call `self.make_current()` if there is no current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
Update the logic in the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if there is no existing current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. Avoid trying to set the current instance if it already exists, in which case a RuntimeError should be raised.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance in the `IOLoop` class.
