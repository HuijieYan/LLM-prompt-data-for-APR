## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop object and set it as the current IOLoop. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which, if set to `True`, should ensure that the current IOLoop is set to the newly initialized one.
2. The issue arises when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True` even when there is already a current IOLoop present. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The bug stems from the logic within the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance differently based on the value of `make_current`.
4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance based on the direct check for `None` rather than the value of `make_current`.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By directly checking the existence of a current IOLoop using `IOLoop.current() is not None`, we ensure that the correct condition is being enforced irrespective of the `make_current` parameter value. This change will make the `initialize` function work as expected and pass the failing test case.
