The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, making it the current instance if needed based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug causes an issue when trying to handle different scenarios regarding the current instance.

One potential error location is the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is used to check if a current instance exists. This condition is used multiple times within the function and is the cause of the issue when trying to set the current instance.

The bug occurs because the logic of checking for a current instance is not done properly, leading to the incorrect raise of a `RuntimeError` when it should not be raised.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists, the function should not attempt to make the current one again.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making sure that the correct logic is used to determine whether a current instance exists or not, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
