## Correction strategy
1. The issue arises because the `initialize` function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` even when `make_current` is specified as `True`, causing it to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. To address this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is specified as `True`.
3. We should only check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True` and allow the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance regardless of the current state.
4. By updating the conditional checks within the `initialize` function, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance is actively existing and attempting to create a new one.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the `initialize` function with the corrected logic, the function will now correctly handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance based on the specified `make_current` parameter. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
