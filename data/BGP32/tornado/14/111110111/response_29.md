Based on the provided information, here is the analysis of the buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class:

### Bug Identification:
1. The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class sets the current instance of the `IOLoop`, but there is a logic issue related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug arises when `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class tries to handle the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
2. When `make_current=True` is passed, the code wrongly attempts to raise an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, indicating that a current `IOLoop` instance already exists (which should not trigger an error in this scenario).
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current=True`, creates an `IOLoop` instance, then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True`, leading to the unnecessary `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we should adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is detected. The goal is to avoid raising an error when `make_current=True` and an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected version of the `initialize` function ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance is already present. This fix aligns the behavior with the intended logic and resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
