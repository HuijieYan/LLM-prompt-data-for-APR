### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize()` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and create one if it doesn't. However, there are issues in the logic of the function that can lead to incorrect behavior.

### Identified errors
1. The condition for checking if `make_current` is `None` is incorrect.
2. The logic for creating a new IOLoop instance is not handled properly.
3. The logic for raising a `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop instance exists is flawed.

### Cause of the bug
The bug in the function is primarily due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `None`, the function should grab the current IOLoop instance if it exists. When it is `True`, the function should create a new IOLoop instance if one doesn't already exist. The logic is currently not handling these cases correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Change the condition for checking if `make_current` is `None` to properly handle the case where a new IOLoop instance should be created.
2. Adjust the logic to correctly create a new IOLoop instance when needed.
3. Modify the logic to raise a `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
