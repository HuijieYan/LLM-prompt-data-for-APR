1. Analyzing the function:
The function `initialize` is designed to initialize an instance of an IOLoop class with an optional parameter `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if a current instance already exists and makes the current instance if not. If `make_current` is `True`, it makes the current instance if none exists, and if an instance already exists, it raises an error.

2. Potential error locations:
The potential error in the function seems to be with the handling of the `make_current` parameter. The conditions for checking and creating the current instance might not be correctly implemented.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug in the code arises from the conditions in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current instance only if none exists. However, the condition to raise an error when an instance already exists is not properly handled.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the condition to raise an error when an instance already exists is correctly implemented. We should also check if there are other logical errors in the function that might impact the initialization process.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None or make_current is True:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

This corrected version of the function properly checks if an instance of IOLoop already exists and handles the scenario when `make_current` is `True` as per the expected behavior.
