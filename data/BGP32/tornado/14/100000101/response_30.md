### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` takes a parameter `make_current` of type `bool` and initializes an instance of `IOLoop` if it is not already initialized. There are several potential error locations within the function:
1. The first `if` condition checks if `make_current` is `None` and then checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, in which case it should call `self.make_current()`. This logic seems correct.
2. The `elif` condition checks if `make_current` is `True` and then checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, where it raises a `RuntimeError` if not. If the condition passes, it should call `self.make_current()`. This logic seems to have a potential issue.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs in the `elif` condition where it raises a `RuntimeError` if there is no current `IOLoop` instance even if `make_current` is `True`. This logic conflicts with the intended behavior of calling `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the `elif` condition to match the intended behavior. We want to prioritize calling `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True` regardless of the current `IOLoop` instance's existence, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
