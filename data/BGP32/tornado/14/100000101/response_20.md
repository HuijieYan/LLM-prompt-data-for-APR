### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is expected to set the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True and if the current IOLoop does not already exist. However, there are bugs in the conditional checks that lead to incorrect behavior.

### Bugs
1. The first conditional check for `make_current` is incorrect. Since `make_current` is not None and evaluates to True, the code within the `elif make_current:` block should execute, but due to the nested conditions, it doesn't.
2. The check for the current IOLoop instance inside both conditional blocks is redundant, as it is repeated. Instead, it should only be checked once to avoid unnecessary duplication.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Fix the conditional structure to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True.
2. Remove the redundant check for the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
