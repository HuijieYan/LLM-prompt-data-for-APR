### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` receives a parameter `make_current` of type `bool`. Based on the code logic, if `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop is already initialized and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is. Otherwise, it proceeds to call the `make_current` function.

### Bug
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, but the current IOLoop is already initialized. In this case, the function incorrectly proceeds to call `make_current` without raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we should first check if the current IOLoop is already initialized when `make_current` is `True`, and only then proceed to call `make_current`. If the current IOLoop is already initialized, we should raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, I have added a check to see if the current IOLoop instance exists before calling `make_current` if `make_current` is `True`. This will ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised when the current IOLoop already exists, as expected.
