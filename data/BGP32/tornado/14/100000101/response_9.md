### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, make it the current instance. If the `make_current` parameter is provided and is `True`, it should raise a RuntimeError if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Error
The bug in the current implementation is that when `make_current` is `True`, it doesn't check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before making it the current instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```
