### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` has an issue with the condition checks and logic flow. 
- The function is supposed to initialize an IOLoop instance, but the logic for checking the existence of the current instance and making it current is not implemented correctly.
- The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`. The logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and then raising an error is flawed.

### Cause of the bug
When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the IOLoop instance already exists. However, the current implementation is not checking this condition correctly, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check if the `make_current` parameter is `True`.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, then check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. If the current instance does not exist, then make the current instance.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
