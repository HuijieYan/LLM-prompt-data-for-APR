### Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it should initialize if no current instance exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it should initialize the current instance but throw an error if it already exists.

### Error location
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is checking if `make_current` is `None` instead of its expected value.
2. The condition `elif make_current` assumes that `make_current` is a boolean, which may not always be the case.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. It does not account for the case where `make_current` is `True` or other values that are not `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the condition `if make_current is None` to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `None`.
2. Modify the condition `elif make_current` to check if `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
