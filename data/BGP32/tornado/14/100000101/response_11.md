### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional logic to check the `make_current` parameter and based on its value it either calls the `make_current` method or raises a `RuntimeError`. However, there is a bug in the logic where it incorrectly checks if the `current IOLoop` exists before invoking `self.make_current()`. This leads to unexpected behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and the `current IOLoop` exists. In this case, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` which is not the intended behavior.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the conditional check for `make_current` should be updated so that it only raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True` and the `current IOLoop` exists.

### Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
