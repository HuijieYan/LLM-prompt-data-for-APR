### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and if not, make it the current instance. However, there is a logical error in the code where the `make_current` parameter is not being handled correctly. The `make_current` parameter should be used to determine whether to make the current instance or not.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function's logic where it doesn't handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately. The `elif make_current` condition is not checking for the value of `make_current`, which would lead to incorrect behavior. This causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` even when `make_current` is `True`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function. We should check the value of `make_current` and make the current instance only if it is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, we should stick to the original logic of making the current instance if it doesn't exist already.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
