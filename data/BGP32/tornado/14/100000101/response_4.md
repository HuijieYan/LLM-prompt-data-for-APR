### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance. The issue lies in the condition where `make_current` is `True` but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. In this case, the function should be raising a `RuntimeError` instead of attempting to call `self.make_current()`.

### Bug:
The bug in the code is that when `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance is already existing instead of trying to make it current.

### Fix:
We need to update the code to raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code will handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists by raising a `RuntimeError`.
