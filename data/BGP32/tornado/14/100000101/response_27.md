### Expected values and types of relevant variables
- IOLoop.current(instance=False): `None`
- make_current call: `Not applicable`
- RuntimeError exception: `Not applicable`

### Explanation of the bug
The bug in the function occurs when the make_current parameter is True. In this case, the function is incorrectly raising a RuntimeError if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, which is the opposite of the intended behavior. The expected behavior should be that a RuntimeError is raised if there is already a current IOLoop instance, not the other way around.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional check for when make_current is True. If a current IOLoop instance already exists, then a RuntimeError should be raised. Otherwise, the make_current method should be called.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly checks whether a current IOLoop instance exists when make_current is True and raises a RuntimeError if it does.
