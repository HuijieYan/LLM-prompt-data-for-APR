### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't exist, or raise an error if it already exists based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there are several issues in the implementation:
1. The logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists is incorrect, as it doesn't consider the passed `make_current` parameter properly.
2. The condition `if make_current is None` is unnecessary, as the code block within it should be executed regardless of the value of `make_current`.

### Bug
The bug in the function is that it only checks for the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `None`, but it skips this check when `make_current` is `True`. This leads to a situation where an error is not raised when it should be.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to always check if the current IOLoop instance exists and make necessary actions based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        if make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the function properly checks for the current IOLoop instance and handles the `make_current` parameter correctly in all cases.
