### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional statement that checks the value of `make_current` and then calls either `self.make_current()` or raises a `RuntimeError`. The issue lies in the comparison of `make_current` with `None`. It should be checked against `True` for the first condition to be executed.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, as the comparison `if make_current is None` is incorrect. This condition should be `if make_current is None`. 

### Fix:
Change the first condition to `if make_current is None` to check if `make_current` is not provided, and switch the second condition to `elif make_current is True` to check if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Corrected function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version should now correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is either `None` or `True`.
