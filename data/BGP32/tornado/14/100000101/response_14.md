### Analysis
1. The function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, calls `self.make_current()`.
2. If `make_current` is not None, it then checks if `make_current` is True and if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If so, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. In the given buggy code, the bug can occur when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is True, but the current `IOLoop` instance is None. In this case, the function should not raise a `RuntimeError` as indicated in the buggy code.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If `make_current` is True, and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, we should call `self.make_current()` rather than raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the function handles the case where `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None by calling `self.make_current()` instead of raising a `RuntimeError`.
