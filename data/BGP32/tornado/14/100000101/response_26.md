### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop exists and make it the current one if it doesn't. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

### Potential Error
The error lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` being true even when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by a logical error in the condition check. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should not raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check when `make_current` is `True`. We should only call `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```
