### Analysis
The bug in the given function lies in the condition check for `make_current`. Currently, if `make_current` is provided as `True`, it should check if the current instance of IOLoop exists and then make it current. If the current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function occurs because the condition check for `make_current` is incorrect. It should first check if `make_current` is `True`, then check if the current IOLoop instance is already present. If the current instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error. However, the current logic does not handle this case properly.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition check for `make_current` to properly handle the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists. We should first check if `make_current` is `True`, and then check if the current instance exists. If it does, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current instance of IOLoop exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`, otherwise, it makes the current instance.
