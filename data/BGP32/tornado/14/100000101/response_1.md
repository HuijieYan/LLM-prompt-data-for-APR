### Analysis
The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop, ensuring that the current IOLoop is set as needed. However, there are several issues in the current implementation:
1. The logic for checking and setting the current IOLoop is incorrect.
2. The `make_current` parameter is not handled correctly.
3. The RuntimeError is being raised inappropriately.

### Bug Cause
- The condition `if make_current` is supposed to check if `make_current` parameter is `True`, but it does not handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.
- If `make_current` is `False`, the current IOLoop should not be set, but the function still tries to set the current IOLoop, resulting in unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Add a condition to handle when `make_current` is `False` so that the current IOLoop is not set in that case.
- Adjust the logic to properly handle the `make_current` parameter.
- Remove the unnecessary RuntimeError.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
