### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class is intended to ensure that only one instance of the `IOLoop` can be the current instance.
2. The failing test is trying to create two instances of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` since the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is occurring due to the current `IOLoop` instance already existing when attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug is likely in the logic where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked, and if not `None`, it should raise an exception.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix involves modifying the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` already exists before creating a new one with `make_current=True`. The fix should throw a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method should now correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` in that scenario.
