1. The given function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization logic for the IOLoop object, including specifying whether it should become the current IOLoop instance or not. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True` is passed to the `IOLoop` constructor, it should make the IOLoop object the current instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current instance.

2. The potential error lies in the way the `initialize` function handles the `make_current` argument. It checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and if `make_current=True`, it raises an error if there is an existing instance.

3. The bug occurs when the test tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, but the function fails to raise an error even though a current IOLoop instance already exists. This leads to the RuntimeError not being triggered when it should have been, indicating a logic error in the function implementation.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, the function should properly check if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the function now correctly checks for an existing current IOLoop instance when `make_current=True` is passed, ensuring that the RuntimeError is raised as expected in the failing test scenario.
