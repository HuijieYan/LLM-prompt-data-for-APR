### Analysis:
- The provided buggy function `initialize` is a method of a class.
- The method takes a parameter `make_current` with a default value of `None`.
- It checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is `None`.
- If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic to handle `make_current` parameter might be incorrect.
2. Calling `self.make_current()` is based on certain conditions that may lead to issues.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. In the failing test provided, `test_force_current`, an instance of IOLoop is created with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists. However, the buggy function's logic does not correctly handle this scenario leading to the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` is specified and the current IOLoop instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised. The logic must be adjusted to handle this scenario correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition checking for an existing current IOLoop instance is adjusted to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

By making this adjustment, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
