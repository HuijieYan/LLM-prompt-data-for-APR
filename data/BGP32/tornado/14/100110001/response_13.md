### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` object with the option `make_current` to determine if it should set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is not specified, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and sets it if not. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance unless one already exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is trying to test the behavior of creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and checking that it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Error:
The buggy function fails to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This causes the failing test to not behave as expected and leads to the test failure.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` is being checked incorrectly. The current logic checks if a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist before creating a new one with `make_current=True`, but it should check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True` is specified.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True` is specified. If a current `IOLoop` instance exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, otherwise create a new `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function now correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True` and raises a `RuntimeError` accordingly. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
