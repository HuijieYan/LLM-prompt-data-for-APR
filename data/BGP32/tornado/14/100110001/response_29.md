## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The failing test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` tries to ensure that creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` fails if there is already a current IOLoop.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised because another IOLoop instance is already current, and the function is correctly preventing the creation of a new one.
4. The bug in the current implementation is that it checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance incorrectly, resulting in the unexpected error being raised.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify how the function checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and handles the logic for creating a new one.

## Fix Strategy:
1. We will modify the logic to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists correctly.
2. If `make_current` is set to `True`, we need to throw an error only if a current IOLoop instance is already present.
3. If `make_current` is `None`, we will check if there is no current instance and proceed to make the current IOLoop instance.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the tiny change of using `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` when checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, we ensure that the correct condition is evaluated and the bug is fixed.
