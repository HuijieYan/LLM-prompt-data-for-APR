### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` object with an optional argument `make_current`. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.
- The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` again, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised but not properly handled.

### Potential Error Location:
- The bug is likely in the `initialize` method where the check to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance does not already exist is not performed correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the mishandling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` method. The code does not properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.
- As a result, even if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, the code proceeds to create a new instance instead of raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, the code properly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to create a new one.
- We should modify the `initialize` method to perform this check and raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the `initialize` function

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By incorporating the proposed fix into the `initialize` method, the code now correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance is present. This corrected version should resolve the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
