## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is supposed to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance. The issue arises when trying to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance when one already exists, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. The failing test case `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is designed to check that the `initialize` function correctly raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function incorrectly throws a `RuntimeError` even if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This behavior is not the expected one based on the failing test case `test_force_current`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to force the creation of a new one. If an instance exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. However, if `make_current` is `None`, the function should proceed as before.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised when attempting to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance when one already exists, as shown in the failing test case.
