### Analysis:
The `initialize` function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and makes it the current instance if not. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The bug seems to be in the logic of checking if the current instance of IOLoop already exists.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the `initialize` function where it checks if `make_current` is set to `True` and if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect check when `make_current` is set to `True`. The condition to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect, which leads to the error being raised incorrectly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition that checks if the current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists has been fixed to correctly raise a `RuntimeError` only if the instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. This should resolve the bug and make the test function pass.
