### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `initialize` within `tornado/ioloop.py`.
- The failing test is `test_force_current` within `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.
- The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` may not be handling the case where `IOLoop.current()` returns an existing instance when `make_current` is `None`.
2. The logic involving `make_current` and checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists seems to be causing the issue.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic to handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists is incorrect. When `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not try to create a new instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for handling the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists needs to be modified. If `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists, we should not try to create a new instance. Only create a new instance if `make_current` is `True` and no current instance exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version should now properly handle the scenario where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
