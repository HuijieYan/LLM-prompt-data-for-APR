### Analysis:
The issue arises in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop`. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the `IOLoop` is initialized with `make_current=True` which should make it the current `IOLoop`. However, in the buggy function, there is a check when `make_current` is `True` to prevent creating another current `IOLoop` if one already exists. This check is causing the `RuntimeError` in the failing test.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `initialize` method's logic to check if the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`. The intention is to prevent creating multiple current `IOLoop` instances, but in this case, it is preventing the correct initialization flow in the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and allow the initialization of the current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the second `if` block, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is already an existing current `IOLoop`. This change allows the correct initialization flow in the failing test scenario.
