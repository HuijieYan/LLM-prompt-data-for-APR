### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance.
- The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is testing the behavior when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` after one has already been set as the current one.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue is likely occurring in the `initialize` method where the check for an existing IOLoop instance is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `initialize` method is not correctly handling the case where an IOLoop instance already exists when a new one is being created with `make_current=True`.
- When `make_current=True`, the method should raise an exception if there is already an existing current IOLoop instance, but the current implementation is not handling this scenario properly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, the `initialize` method should check if the current IOLoop instance is `None` when `make_current=True`. If there is already a current IOLoop instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction in the `initialize` method, it will now correctly handle the scenario where a new IOLoop instance is being created with `make_current=True` when there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.
