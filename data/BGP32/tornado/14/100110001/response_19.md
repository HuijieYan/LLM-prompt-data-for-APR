## Buggy Function Analysis:
The `initialize` function is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. It accepts an optional argument `make_current`, which is used to determine if the current IOLoop needs to be set as the current instance.

1. The function first checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is `None` and no current IOLoop instance exists, it calls the `make_current` method to set the current IOLoop.

2. If `make_current` is not `None` and evaluates to `True`, it checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists. Otherwise, it sets the current IOLoop instance.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the condition for the `elif` block. Since the condition is `make_current`, if a current IOLoop instance exists, it goes through the `elif` block instead of setting the current instance. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the objective is to set the current IOLoop instance.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `elif` block. Instead of checking if a current IOLoop instance exists, we should directly set the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()  # Set the current IOLoop instance directly

```

By modifying the logic in the `elif` block to directly set the current IOLoop instance, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is not raised unnecessarily. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
