### Bug Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug is in the conditional check when `make_current` is set to `True`. It is incorrectly throwing a `RuntimeError` even if the current IOLoop instance exists.
3. The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should throw a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The error message confirms that the bug is in the condition that raises `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check whether the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

With this fix, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test without throwing any `RuntimeError`.
