### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not behaving as expected, causing the test `test_force_current` to fail.
- The test attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should fail and raise a `RuntimeError` since an IOLoop instance already exists.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is not being raised as expected.

### Potential Error Location:
- The `initialize` function has two conditional blocks to handle `make_current` parameter, one for `None` and the other for `True`.
- The issue might be with the logic inside the conditional blocks that is not correctly handling the case of an existing IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises because even when an IOLoop instance already exists, the code does not properly handle the case when `make_current=True` is called.
- The logic in the `initialize` function does not check for an existing IOLoop instance correctly before attempting to make it current, leading to the `RuntimeError` not being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, the function checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function as shown above, it checks for the existence of an IOLoop instance before making it current. This corrected version ensures that a `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to make an existing IOLoop instance current, resolving the bug.
