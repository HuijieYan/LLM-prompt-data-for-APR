### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file of the Tornado library.
2. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object with the option to make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is True.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop object with `make_current=True`, checks if it is the current IOLoop, and then tries to create another IOLoop object with `make_current=True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug seems to be in the way the initialization is handled when `make_current=True`. If the current IOLoop already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to first check if the current IOLoop exists before trying to make the current IOLoop. If it does, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding a check for the current IOLoop instance before trying to make it the current IOLoop, the corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
