## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `ioloop.py` module of the `tornado` library.
2. The failing test (`test_force_current`) is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then expects an error when trying to create another `IOLoop` instance with the same attribute.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The issue lies in the condition checks within the `initialize` method where the error is not being raised when it should be.
   
## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The bug fix involves correctly handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Before creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, we need to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Update the condition to raise the error when the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` and `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one with `make_current=True`. If the current instance exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected by the test scenario.
