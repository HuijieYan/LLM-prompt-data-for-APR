The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` has a flaw in its logic that is causing the test to fail. The main issue is that when `make_current=True`, it is checking if the current IOLoop exists and then raising a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the correct behavior in this case should be to set the current IOLoop to the one being initialized.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            IOLoop.current(current_ioloop)
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check the `current_ioloop` status and then handle the logic accordingly. We set the current IOLoop if it exists and skip it if it doesn't, allowing the initialization to proceed without errors.

After making this change, the test function `test_force_current` should pass without any issues.
