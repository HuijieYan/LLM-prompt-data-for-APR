The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a flaw in handling the `make_current` parameter. The issue arises when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. The buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in such cases, which is not the desired behavior.

### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `True` and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If the instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance while the current instance is already present.
3. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with an existing current instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if the existing `IOLoop` instance is the same as the one being created with `make_current=True`. It incorrectly throws an exception in this scenario.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the one being created with `make_current=True`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` when the current instance is different from the one being created.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the one being created. This fix ensures that a `RuntimeError` will only be raised when trying to create a new instance with a different current `IOLoop`. It should enable the failing test `test_force_current` to pass successfully.
