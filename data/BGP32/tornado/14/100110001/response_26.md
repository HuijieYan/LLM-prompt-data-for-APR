1. Analysis: The `initialize` method is intended to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance. The issue arises when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an `IOLoop` instance already exists. The existing `IOLoop` instance is being checked incorrectly, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

2. Error Location: The problematic part is the `initialize` method inside the `IOLoop` class.

3. Cause of the Bug: The bug is due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` flag. When `make_current=True` is passed to create a new `IOLoop` instance, the existing check for an already existing `IOLoop` instance is flawed. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

4. Fix Strategy: Adjust the logic for checking if an existing `IOLoop` instance is present to accurately determine whether it should be created or raise an error.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` method will correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed, and it will raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This will address the bug and make the failing test pass.
