### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object, specifically checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The test `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is trying to ensure that creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current IOLoop instance existing.

### Potential Errors:
1. The conditional logic in the `initialize` function might not be correctly handling the case where `make_current` parameter is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
2. The call to `self.make_current()` might be missing in some cases which could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter and there is already a current IOLoop instance, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the test failure and the `RuntimeError` not being raised as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` is passed and there is already an existing IOLoop instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. Additionally, ensure that the `self.make_current()` method is correctly called when needed.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional logic for checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance and raising a `RuntimeError` when necessary, the bug should be fixed. The corrected function should pass the failing test case `test_force_current`.
