### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is failing the test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` attribute, and then it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current=True` and an instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. However, the current implementation does not check this condition correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised. We need to modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to correctly handle this scenario.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this change, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
