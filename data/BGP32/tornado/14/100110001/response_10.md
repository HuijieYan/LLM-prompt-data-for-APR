### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file is checking if there is an existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to True, and throwing a `RuntimeError` if one already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` is trying to create multiple IOLoop instances with `make_current=True`, and expects the second instance creation to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised prematurely when the second IOLoop instance is created.
4. The bug is likely due to the fact that `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` checks if an instance of IOLoop already exists, but it's being called before the new instance is even created. This leads to the premature `RuntimeError`. The logic should be adjusted to check for existing instances after creating the new instance.
5. To fix this bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to first create the IOLoop instance and then check if an existing instance already exists before setting it as the current instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        new_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if new_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the check for an existing instance after creating the new instance, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is indeed another IOLoop instance already present.
