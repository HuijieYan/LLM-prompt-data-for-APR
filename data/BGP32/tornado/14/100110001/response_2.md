### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the logic for creating a current instance of the IOLoop and checking if one already exists. The bug in the current implementation is that it does not handle the scenario correctly where a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the `initialize` function where the condition `if make_current is None:` is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current=True` is passed to the `IOLoop` constructor, the `initialize` function first checks if a current IOLoop does not exist and then attempts to create a new one. However, if a current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that a current IOLoop already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case to indicate that a current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, preventing the creation of a duplicate IOLoop instance. This should address the bug and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
