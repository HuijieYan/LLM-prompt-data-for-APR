### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current IOLoop instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but the current instance already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` validates this bug by expecting a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a new current instance if one already exists.
4. The issue on GitHub questions the logic where the `RuntimeError` is raised even when the current instance is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, but the current IOLoop instance already exists. The logic should not raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a new current instance with `make_current=True` if an instance already exists. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the bug in the logic check for `make_current=True` when a current instance is already present, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
