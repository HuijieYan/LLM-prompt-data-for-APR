### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, then it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to see if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks again if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The issue raised on GitHub questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` but then also raises an error for "IOLoop already exists". This seems contradictory.
4. The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking the presence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The incorrect behavior is that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it should not raise a `RuntimeError`, but the current code is behaving otherwise.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to match the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The above fix modifies the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and to raise a `RuntimeError` only when it is not `None` as expected.

After applying this fix, the test function `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
