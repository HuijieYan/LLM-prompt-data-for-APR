### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance.
- The bug arises when the function is called with `make_current=True`. It is expected that if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. However, the current implementation is not correctly checking for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make it current.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` twice and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised during the second attempt.
- The GitHub issue highlights the confusion about the logic on line 252 of `ioloop.py` related to checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then raising an "already exists" error.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function stems from the incorrect logic for checking the existence of an `IOLoop` instance. The current implementation does not verify if an instance already exists before trying to make it current or raising an error. This leads to unexpected behavior during the initialization process.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should check for the existence of an instance before making it current or raising an error when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the error is only raised when an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This correction should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
