### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is None or not. If it is None, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True, it again checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then tries to make the current one, but if it already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then checks if the current instance is the one created. It also tries to create another one with `make_current=True` again to test the RuntimeError.

### Error Location:
- The bug is in the logic where the function checks if `make_current` is True and whether the current instance is None. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current instance already exists and `make_current` is True.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked before `make_current` is actually set. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to first check if `make_current` is True and then verify if the current instance already exists before calling `self.make_current()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, the bug should be fixed and the failing test should pass successfully.
