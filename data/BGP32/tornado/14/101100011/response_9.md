### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior of the code, where even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it still raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `initialize` function where the conditions for checking the current `IOLoop` instance are not correctly implemented.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional check for the current `IOLoop` instance existing in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It checks if the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before making the current `IOLoop`. However, if `make_current=True` is specified, it should raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is passed as an argument.
2. Ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as expected based on the failing test case and the expected behavior indicated by the GitHub issue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `IOLoop` class should now correctly handle the initialization and setting of the current `IOLoop` instance, passing the failing test case and addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report.
