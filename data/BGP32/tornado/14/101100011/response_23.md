### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance with the option to force it as the current instance or not.
2. The issue arises when trying to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then either raising an error or making the current instance based on the input parameters.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` intends to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempt to create another one which should raise a `RuntimeError` since a current instance already exists.
4. The bug seems to occur due to the check in the `initialize` function not correctly handling the logic to raise an error when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When the function is called with `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly, leading to the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then appropriately handle the case where a new instance is being forced as the current one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the logic in the `initialize` function to check if a current `IOLoop` instance is not None when attempting to create a new one, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
