### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance with a specific flag `make_current`. The issue arises when the flag is set to `True`, indicating that a new IOLoop instance should be made current. However, the current logic incorrectly checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before making the new instance current, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the buggy function `initialize` lies in the condition where `make_current` is set to `True`, and it incorrectly checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before making the new instance current.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before setting the new one as current when `make_current` is `True`. This check is unnecessary and leads to the `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary check for an already existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead, we should directly set the new instance as current without checking for the existence of another instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            self.make_current()
    
```

By simplifying the logic in the `initialize` function to directly make the new instance current when `make_current` is `True`, we prevent the unnecessary check for an existing IOLoop instance and resolve the bug. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
