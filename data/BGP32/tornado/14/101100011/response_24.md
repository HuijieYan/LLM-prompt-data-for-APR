### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by calling the `current` function with `instance=False`. If an instance exists (i.e., not None), it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the check logic is flawed leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with the same configuration which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the logic at line 252 where it checks for an existing instance.
4. The strategy for fixing the bug would be to update the `initialize` function's logic to correctly handle checking for an existing instance and raising the `RuntimeError` when needed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the original code arises from the incorrect conditional check for an existing `IOLoop` instance. The check logic is incomplete and does not properly handle the scenario where an instance is already present, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

### Proposed Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The updated code includes a proper check for the existing instance and adjusts the conditions accordingly. This version should pass the failing test and address the GitHub issue.
