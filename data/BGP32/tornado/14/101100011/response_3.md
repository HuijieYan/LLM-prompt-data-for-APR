### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does when `make_current` is `True`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another one, expecting a `RuntimeError` because a current instance already exists.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the comparison logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should check if a current instance already exists before creating a new one but the comparison logic is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the comparison logic in the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the presence of a current instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass
    
    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case when a current instance already exists while `make_current` is `True`, preventing the erroneous `RuntimeError` from being raised. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
