### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The bug seems to be caused by incorrect logic in how the `make_current` parameter is handled.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is checking if multiple instances of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` can be created, which should not be allowed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current and raises an error if so.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, it should check if an `IOLoop` instance is already current before attempting to set it as current.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter has been fixed to correctly check if an `IOLoop` instance is already current before making it current.

The failing test should now pass with this corrected version.
