### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` but the condition for checking if `make_current` is `True` is causing the issue.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and expects an exception if a current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug occurs because the condition `elif make_current:` checks if `make_current` is `True` but it should compare against `None`. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to `elif make_current is None:`.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:  # Corrected the condition
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition in the `initialize` function to compare `make_current` against `None`, the issue reported in the GitHub will be resolved.
