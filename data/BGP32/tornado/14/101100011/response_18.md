### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists by calling the `current` function. If not, it makes the current `IOLoop` instance by calling `make_current`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the test file `ioloop_test.py` attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. It expects that if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The GitHub issue suggests a discrepancy where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, but the code still tries to raise an error for an existing instance.

### Error Location:
The error seems to be in the handling of the instance check in the `initialize` function. The condition to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to True, but an instance already exists is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the instance check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, it should only create a new `IOLoop` instance if none already exists. However, the current implementation incorrectly tries to raise an error even when `make_current=True` and an instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Remove the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and an instance already exists.
2. Update the logic to only call `make_current` if `make_current` is `None` or `True` and no `IOLoop` instance currently exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
      # Unchanged implementation

    def make_current(self):
      # Unchanged implementation

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will only make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `None` or `True` and there is no existing instance.

This corrected version should address the issue raised in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
