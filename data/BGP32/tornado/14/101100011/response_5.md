### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue lies in the checking logic when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect logic when checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Missing handling for the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Cause of the bug:
The buggy function fails in the test `test_force_current`, specifically at the line `IOLoop(make_current=True)`. The issue arises because the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class does not handle the scenario where `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. This leads to an incorrect check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and results in the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. We need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, it verifies the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance more accurately before making it current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` has been fixed. Now, it correctly raises an error when the current instance already exists, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue and passing the failing test.
