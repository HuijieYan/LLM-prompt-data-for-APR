### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is `None` or not. If `make_current` is `None`, then it checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists using the `current` method. If not, it calls the `make_current` method.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is testing the behavior when `make_current=True`, so it expects that a new instance of `IOLoop` is created as the current one.
3. The GitHub issue points out that even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, the code is still raising a `RuntimeError` for "current IOLoop already exists".
4. The cause of the bug is the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the logic in the `initialize` function. It should raise an error only when there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and `make_current=True`.
5. The strategy to fix the bug is to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the conditions under which the `RuntimeError` should be raised.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated initialize function with corrected logic
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None and make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function, the corrected version will now pass the failing test and resolve the issue described on GitHub.
