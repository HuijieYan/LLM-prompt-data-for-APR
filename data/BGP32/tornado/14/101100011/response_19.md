### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class has a buggy logic that is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file is designed to check the behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the `initialize` function, the logic for handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True` is incorrect.
2. When `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current IOLoop is `None`. If it is not `None`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists. This contradicts the expected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. When `make_current` is `True`, always call `self.make_current()` regardless of the current state of the IOLoop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()  # Always make current even if it exists
```

Now, with the corrected `initialize` function, it should handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` without incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError`. The provided failing test `test_force_current` should pass with this correction.
