### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance.
2. The issue seems to be with the logic inside the `initialize` function that checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that creating a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The issue on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the logic at line 252 regarding handling the situation when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which conflicts with the behavior of raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises due to incorrect logic. When `make_current` is None, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does not exist, it should create a new `IOLoop` instance. However, the logic is flawed as it does not properly handle this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
2. Update the logic to properly handle the cases when `make_current` is None or True as per the requirements of the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function with the corrected logic as shown above, the bug in handling the current `IOLoop` instance check is addressed, resolving the issue raised on GitHub. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current` successfully.
