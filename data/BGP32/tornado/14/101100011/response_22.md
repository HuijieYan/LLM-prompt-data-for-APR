### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop instance but is failing to do so.
2. The issue seems to be with the conditional logic in the `initialize` function, specifically with how it handles the `make_current` parameter.
3. The failing test case `test_force_current` indicates that the `make_current` parameter is not being handled correctly, leading to a RuntimeError when a second IOLoop instance is attempted to be created with `make_current=True`.
4. The issue is related to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True` is passed, and an IOLoop instance already exists, a RuntimeError should be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check the `make_current` parameter properly in the `initialize` function and make sure it behaves as expected based on the business logic.
2. Adjust the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the different scenarios based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. When `make_current=True` is passed and an IOLoop instance already exists, raise a RuntimeError as specified in the test case.
4. Update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the initialization logic of the IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        pass  # Implementation not relevant for this bug fix

    def make_current(self):
        pass  # Implementation not relevant for this bug fix

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After applying the corrections, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test case mentioned above.
