### Analyzing the buggy function:

The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to True, and it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if the current IOLoop instance is not already set.

### Potential error locations:
- Checking the condition for raising the `RuntimeError`
- Calling the `make_current` method
- Checking the current IOLoop instance

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is erroneously raising a `RuntimeError` when the `make_current` parameter is True, even if there is no current IOLoop instance. This behavior contradicts the intention specified in the test function. The issue on GitHub suggests that the logic at line 252 (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) is not correctly handled in relation to the `RuntimeError` condition.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the logic in the `initialize` function so that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when the current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to True.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` method is called properly to set the current IOLoop instance when needed.
3. Verify the condition for checking the current IOLoop instance to match the expected behavior specified in the failing test.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` only when the current IOLoop instance is already set and `make_current` is True, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version aligns with the expected behavior specified in the failing test case.
