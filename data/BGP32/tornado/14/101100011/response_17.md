### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` argument is None or not. If it is None, then it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is None, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current IOLoop instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` instantiates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` and then checks if `IOLoop.current()` is the same instance. It also checks if a RuntimeError is raised when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The GitHub issue points out that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked if it is None, but a RuntimeError is raised if it is not None.
4. The bug is that the `initialize` function is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, but if it is not None, it should not raise an error immediately unless the `make_current` argument is True, indicating an attempt to forcefully set the current IOLoop instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None without raising an error unless `make_current` is True.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Only raise an error if not None and make_current is True
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After making this modification, the `initialize` function will only raise a RuntimeError when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and `make_current` is True. This change aligns with the intended behavior and should now pass the failing test and fix the reported issue on GitHub.
