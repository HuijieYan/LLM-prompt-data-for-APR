### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is None and if the current IOLoop instance is None before calling the `make_current` method. 
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` expects that when `make_current` is set to True, a new IOLoop instance is created and set as the current instance. Subsequent attempts to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current` as True should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test fails because the buggy function `initialize` does not handle the case when `make_current` is True correctly. It should first check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is True correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if an IOLoop instance exists if `make_current` is True. If an instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`, otherwise create a new instance and set it as the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

After applying this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True, preventing the issue described in the GitHub post and passing the failing test.
