1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for making the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if the `make_current` flag is provided and if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

2. The potential error location within the function is the logic of checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` and deciding whether to make the current instance based on the `make_current` flag.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` and raises an error if one already exists. This is in conflict with the intention of forcing the current instance to be the one being initialized.

4. To fix the bug, we should change the logic of the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, it should explicitly make the current instance without checking if one already exists.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods here

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is not None:
            self.make_current()

        # Removed unnecessary check for current instance when make_current is True
        # Removed elif condition and adjusted the logic accordingly
``` 

With this corrected version, the function will not check for the existence of a current instance when `make_current=True`, ensuring that the current instance is set without causing the `RuntimeError`.
