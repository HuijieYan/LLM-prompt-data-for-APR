1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. This method is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop. The IOLoop class also has a `current` method that is used to retrieve the current IOLoop instance and a `make_current` method that is used to make the current IOLoop instance.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function is when checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and raising an error if it does when `make_current` is set to `True`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic is incorrect when checking if the current IOLoop instance exists. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect. It is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance does not exist when `make_current` is set to `True`, but it currently checks if it does not exist in both cases, leading to the error message stating that the current IOLoop already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. If `make_current` is `None`, we should make the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is `False`, we should not attempt to make the current IOLoop instance.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
