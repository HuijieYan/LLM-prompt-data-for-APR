1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object with a given setting `make_current`. The function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it sets the current instance depending on the value of `make_current`.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - When `make_current` is not provided and the current instance check fails.
   - When `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that in the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists, the buggy function raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This is incorrect behavior and should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statement for when `make_current` is `True` to only raise an error if there is no current instance, as intended.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the check in the `elif make_current` block to verify if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
