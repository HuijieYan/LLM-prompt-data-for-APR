1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. The `initialize` method is responsible for setting up the IOLoop instance. It takes an optional argument `make_current` which determines whether the IOLoop instance should become the current instance.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement for `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, the code is trying to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code is incorrectly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is meant to check if a current instance does not exist. However, in the case of `make_current=True`, it should be checking if an instance already exists, not if it doesn't exist.

4. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for `make_current=True` to check if a current instance exists instead of checking if it doesn't exist. We should raise a `RuntimeError` only if an instance is already present when `make_current=True`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This fix ensures that the code properly handles the case where `make_current=True` and correctly checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance.
