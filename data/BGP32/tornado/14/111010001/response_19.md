### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists before making the current instance or raising an error if it already exists.
2. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists, as it raises the `RuntimeError` even though `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, but not if `make_current` is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Change this line
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change this line
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is False:  # Add this line
        self.make_current()  # Add this line
```

By making the above changes, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Additionally, if `make_current` is set to `False`, we make the current instance without checking for existing instances.
