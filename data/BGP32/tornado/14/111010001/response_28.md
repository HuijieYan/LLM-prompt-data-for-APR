### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance with a given flag `make_current`.
2. The error message indicates that the error is occurring when attempting to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The error occurs due to the check for an existing current IOLoop instance, which is incorrect given the context of creating a new IOLoop instance.
4. The bug is in the conditional logic within the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current` block.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`. This check should not be performed during the initialization of a new IOLoop instance.

### Fix Strategy:
Remove the check for an existing current IOLoop instance within the `elif make_current` block since it is unnecessary when creating a new IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version removes the redundant check for an existing current IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`, ensuring that the IOLoop instance is correctly initialized without raising an error for an existing instance.
