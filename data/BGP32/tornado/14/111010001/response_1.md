### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance.
2. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make the new instance current. If it exists, we should not make the new instance current and raise an error.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the `initialize` function to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make the new instance current. If a current instance exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function in the IOLoop class
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists with `make_current` set to `True`, preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised.
