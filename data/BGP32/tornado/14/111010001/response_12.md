### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado` library.
2. The `initialize` function takes an optional argument `make_current` which can either be `None` or `True`.
3. The purpose of the function is to ensure that there is at most one current `IOLoop` instance in the system.
4. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`. In this case, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, but the existing logic in the function does not handle this situation correctly.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the function attempts to set the current `IOLoop` anyway, resulting in the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

### Fix: 
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case and prevent the creation of a new current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current argument is not provided
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()  # Set the current IOLoop
    elif make_current:  # If make_current=True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic, the function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. It should pass the failing test.
