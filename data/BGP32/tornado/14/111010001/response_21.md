## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The `initialize` method sets up the `IOLoop` instance with a particular configuration, including making it current.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is related to the behavior of `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` method. The error occurs when `make_current=True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The bug is caused by an incorrect check inside the `initialize` method that does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Fix and corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` method correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True` and raises an error if it does.
