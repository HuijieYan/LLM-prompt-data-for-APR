1. Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
- The function is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and behaves differently based on the `make_current` parameter passed to it.
- The error message indicates that the bug is related to the logic of checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if it already exists.
- The error occurs when `make_current=True` and the function tries to make the current instance of `IOLoop`.

2. Potential error locations:
- The error could be related to how the function checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and how it handles the `make_current` parameter.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs when `make_current=True`, causing the function to check for the current instance of `IOLoop` and raise an error if it already exists.
- The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing, which conflicts with the logic in the function.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- One potential fix is to remove the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, as the intention might be to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        # Commenting out the check for existing current instance when make_current=True
        # if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        #     raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By removing the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, we avoid the RuntimeError that was being raised. This change allows the function to always set the current `IOLoop` when `make_current=True`.
