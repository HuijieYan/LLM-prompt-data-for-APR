1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The `initialize` function is meant to set up the IOLoop instance, specifically handling the logic related to the `make_current` parameter. The error message states that a `RuntimeError` is raised when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and a current IOLoop already exists.

2. The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
   - The `if make_current is None` block, where it checks if a current IOLoop instance exists but does not handle the case where `make_current = True`.
   - The `elif make_current:` block, which raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it checks if a current IOLoop instance exists in the `if make_current is None` block and then incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in the `elif make_current:` block.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the different cases for `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, it should check for an existing instance and make it current if necessary. If `make_current` is `True`, it should forcefully make the instance current if it does not exist, but should not raise an error if a current instance already exists.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the `make_current` parameter is handled correctly based on whether a current IOLoop instance exists or not. It will set the current IOLoop instance or make the current instance, as needed, without raising unnecessary errors.
