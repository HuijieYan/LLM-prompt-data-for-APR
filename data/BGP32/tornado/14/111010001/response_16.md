1. Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True` and then tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance based on these conditions. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it detects that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

2. Error Location:
The error occurs at the line `if make_current is None:` where the logic inside the `if` block should not check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, as the check is intended only for `True` condition.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the code mistakenly tries to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `if` block where `make_current` is checked for `True`. In this case, we should only ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise an error if not, without checking if it already exists.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version fixes the bug by changing the logic to only check for the existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, and raising an error if it doesn't exist. Otherwise, it proceeds with making the current instance as needed.
