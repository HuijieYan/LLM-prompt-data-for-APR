1. The buggy function `initialize` inside the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current` is None, it tries to make the `IOLoop` instance current if there isn't already a current instance. If `make_current` is True, it checks if a current instance exists and raises an error if it does.

2. The potential error locations in the buggy function are:
   - The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` function might not be correctly evaluating whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
   - The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` function might be incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists is flawed. Due to incorrect handling of the `instance=False` argument in the `IOLoop.current` function, the check whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists is not functioning as expected. As a result, the code incorrectly raises a RuntimeError for an existing `IOLoop` instance.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is done correctly. This involves modifying the condition that checks for the existence of a current instance.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:  # Change instance to True to correctly check for current instance
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:  # Change the condition to check if a current instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the condition for checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance is correctly evaluated, resolving the bug in the function.
