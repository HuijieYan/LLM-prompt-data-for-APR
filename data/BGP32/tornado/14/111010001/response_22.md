1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method is responsible for initializing an instance of the `IOLoop` class. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

2. The potential error location is within the conditional block for the `make_current` parameter. 

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, the function is checking if there is no current `IOLoop` instance existing and then calling `self.make_current()`. However, if a current instance already exists, it should raise an error, but instead, it is attempting to make the current instance again unconditionally.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional block for the `make_current` parameter. We should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing before attempting to make the current instance.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the conditional check for `make_current=True`, we ensure that if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it will raise an error as intended.
