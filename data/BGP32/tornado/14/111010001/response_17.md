### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current instance of the `IOLoop` exists using the `current` function and then makes the current instance using `make_current`.
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised, suggesting that there is a check for an already existing current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug occurs when passing `make_current=True` to the `initialize` function, and it tries to make the current instance even if it already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        return
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- We store the current instance of `IOLoop` in a variable `current_instance` for ease of use.
- We first check if `make_current` is None, and if so, we only make the current instance if it doesn't exist.
- Next, if `make_current=True`, we check if a current instance already exists and raise an error if it does.
- Finally, we only try to make the current instance if it doesn't already exist in this case.
- The corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
