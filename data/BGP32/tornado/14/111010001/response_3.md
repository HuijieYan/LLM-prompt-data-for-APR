1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object. It takes a single optional argument `make_current` which is used to control whether the newly created `IOLoop` object should become the current `IOLoop` instance. The function checks if the `make_current` flag is `None` or `True` and then performs the necessary actions.

2. Potential error locations:
The error seems to be caused by the conditional statement checking if `make_current` is `True`. If this condition is triggered, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is contradictory.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the logic inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, the function proceeds to set the current instance. However, if it is not `None`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is not the intended behavior.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the check for the current `IOLoop` instance being `None` inside the `elif make_current:` block. Instead, we should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter without raising any incorrect `RuntimeError`. This fixed version should pass the failing test.
