1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether it should be made current. The error message indicates that the method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

2. The potential error location within the `initialize` method is in the logic that checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether it should be made current.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. It first checks if `make_current` is None and then checks if there is no existing current `IOLoop` instance, which would happen if `instance=False` is passed to the `IOLoop.current` method. If both conditions are met, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is set to True in the `initialize` call, it should not raise an error even if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. Instead, it should simply make the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't exist.

4. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to account for cases where `make_current` is set to True. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
# Corrected version of the initialize method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` method will only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and there is no existing current `IOLoop`. If there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is True, it will simply use that instance without raising an error.
