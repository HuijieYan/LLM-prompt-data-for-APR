### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
- It has a conditional check to see if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it calls the `make_current` method.
- If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError`, otherwise it calls the `make_current` method.
- The error message is indicating that a `RuntimeError` is being raised when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Error Cause
- The buggy function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when it should actually handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- The error occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking for the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance, which is the opposite of what is needed when `make_current` is `True`.

### Fix Strategy
- To address the bug, we need to update the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- We should check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` instead of checking for its absence.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After making this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised.
