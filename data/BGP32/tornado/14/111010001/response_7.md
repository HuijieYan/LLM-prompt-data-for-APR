## Analysis
1. The `IOLoop` class is a level-triggered I/O loop in tornado.
2. The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class initializes the IOLoop instance.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is within the `initialize` function, where it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, it always tries to become the current `IOLoop`, regardless of whether there is an existing instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` before attempting to make the current instance.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current instance.
2. Only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
