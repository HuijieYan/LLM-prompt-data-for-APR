1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is causing an error.
2. The potential error location is the logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
3. The buggy function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and tries to make the current instance. If `make_current` argument is explicitly set to `True`, it throws a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as intended.
