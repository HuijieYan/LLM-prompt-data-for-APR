### Analyzing the buggy function

- **Buggy function**: `initialize(self, make_current=None)`
- **Related functions**: `current(instance=True)`, `make_current(self)`
- **Corresponding error message**: `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`
- **Expected input/output values**:
  - Case 1: `make_current=True`
- **GitHub issue**: The issue questions the logic behind raising an error for the `current IOLoop already exists` message when `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` followed by an error message might be causing the issue.
2. The logic around handling the `make_current` parameter within the `initialize` function could be problematic.

### Explanation of the bug
The bug arises from the fact that the code is trying to handle the scenario where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The logic checks if the current instance is `None` before proceeding. However, if `make_current` is set to `True`, the code still raises an error stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even if it is apparently `None`. This discrepancy leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised unexpectedly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the logic within the `initialize` function correctly handles the case of `make_current=True` and the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. Adjusting the conditional statements and error handling should help address this issue.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic as shown above, we ensure that the correct conditions are checked and the error is only raised when necessary based on the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
