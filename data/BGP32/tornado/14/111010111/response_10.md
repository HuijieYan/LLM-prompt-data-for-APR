### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of an event loop. It checks the `make_current` argument to either make the current event loop or raise an error if one already exists.
2. The error message indicates that it is trying to enforce that the current event loop should be made based on the provided argument, but it detects an existing event loop and raises an error.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but an existing event loop is already present. The function mistakenly raises an error in this case, contradicting the intended behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement for when `make_current` is `True` and an existing event loop is detected to ensure it doesn't raise an error.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current event loop.
2. Instead of raising an error, ignore the attempt to make the event loop current if one already exists.
3. Modify the code to handle this scenario without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            # Do nothing if a current IOLoop already exists
            pass
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing event loop without raising an error.
