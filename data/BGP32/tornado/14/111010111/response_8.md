### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current IOLoop instance. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but the current IOLoop instance already exists, triggering a `RuntimeError`.
2. The bug occurs within the `initialize` function where it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance before setting a new one. If `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists, it erroneously raises an error.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function, where it should not throw an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks to properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:  # Modified condition to avoid error
                return  # Do not raise an error if current instance already exists
            self.make_current()
```

With this adjustment, the `initialize` function will ensure the current IOLoop is set only if `make_current` is `True` and no current instance exists. If a current instance is already set and `make_current` is `True`, it will not raise a `RuntimeError`, thus resolving the bug.
