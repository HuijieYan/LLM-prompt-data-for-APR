Based on the error message and the provided information, the buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` even though the current `IOLoop` instance is already set.

### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and then verifies if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
- If `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance is found, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Error Cause:
1. In the case where `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The logic should first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and only raise an error if there is none when `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic within the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` if no current `IOLoop` instance is found.
2. The function should ensure that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is performed before deciding to raise an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected function ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue raised on GitHub.
