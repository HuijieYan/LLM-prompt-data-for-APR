### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and make the current instance if needed based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but the check for the current instance fails and the function raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is in the logic flow where it should be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is already present when `make_current` is `True`, instead of raising an error immediately.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Suggested Fix:
1. Modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current` is `True`, and then, if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, raise an error, otherwise, make the current instance.
2. Adjust the conditional statements to handle the `make_current` parameter properly without raising an error when it is not needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
