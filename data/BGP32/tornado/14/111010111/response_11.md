### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The bug is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
3. The issue seems to stem from the logic within the `initialize` function where it raises an error if both `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is `None`.
4. The intention of this logic is likely to prevent multiple instances of `IOLoop` from being created when `make_current` is set to `True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check for raising the `RuntimeError` to correctly handle the case when a current instance does not exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check for raising the `RuntimeError`, the corrected function should now correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`.
