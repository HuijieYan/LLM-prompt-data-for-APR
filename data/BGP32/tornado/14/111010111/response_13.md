### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function and Class Relationship**:
   - The `initialize` function is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
   - The `initialize` function calls the `current` and `make_current` functions of the same class.

2. **Error Location**:
   - The error occurs in the `initialize` function on line 253, where a `RuntimeError` is raised if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - In the failing test, `make_current` is set to `True`.
   - The bug arises because when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if one exists.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. If there is already a current instance, we shouldn't raise an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the comparison in the `elif` statement to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance present.
