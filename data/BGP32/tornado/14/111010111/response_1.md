### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and trying to make the current instance if it doesn't exist. If `make_current` argument is provided as `True` and there is already a current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but the current instance check is failing erroneously.
3. The cause of the bug is that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not functioning correctly. When `make_current=True`, it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance, but the check is failing to detect the existing instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where it checks for an existing `IOLoop` instance and ensure the logic correctly handles the case when `make_current=True`.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` only if necessary.
