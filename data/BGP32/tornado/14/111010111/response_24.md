### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization process for the IOLoop object.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. It checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and if not, attempts to make the current IOLoop, but throws a `RuntimeError` even though the IOLoop is not present.
3. The bug arises due to a logical issue in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks whether the IOLoop is `None` when it should be checking if there is already a current IOLoop instance existing.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.
2. Ensure that if `make_current=True` is provided, the IOLoop instance is only made current if it does not already exist.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # Existing functions in the class

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current=True`, we can fix the bug and ensure that the current IOLoop is only made if it doesn't already exist.
