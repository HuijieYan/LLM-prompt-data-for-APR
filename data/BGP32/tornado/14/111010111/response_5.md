The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is related to the way it handles the `make_current` parameter. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`. In this case, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance available before trying to make the current instance, but it incorrectly raises an error even if there is no current instance.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance available. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, we ensure that the error is only raised when there is already an existing current instance and the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and handle the `make_current` parameter as expected.
