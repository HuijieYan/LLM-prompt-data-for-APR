Based on the provided information, the bug in the `initialize` function arises when `make_current` is `True`, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which contradicts the check for an existing IOLoop instance. This mismatch triggers the `RuntimeError` mentioning that the current IOLoop already exists, which is incorrect in this context.

### Bug Explanation:
1. The `initialize` function aims to set the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it should enforce the presence of an existing IOLoop instance.
3. However, due to the buggy logic, if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` indicating the IOLoop already exists.
4. This behavior contradicts the expected action and leads to the failing test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` but no current IOLoop instance exists. By modifying the condition checking, we can ensure that the check aligns with the intended behavior and prevents the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the condition for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists is adjusted to match the expected behavior based on the `make_current` parameter. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is a conflicting IOLoop instance under the correct circumstances.
