### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance is None or not, and based on that, either making the current instance or raising an error.
2. The error message indicates that the error is being raised when `make_current` is True, but the current `IOLoop` instance is already present.
3. The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect handling of the condition for when `make_current` is True. If the current `IOLoop` instance is already present, it should not raise an error.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for when `make_current` is True to only make the current instance if it is None, and not raise an error if it is already present.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, the condition checking for `make_current` should be updated. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition logic as shown above, the corrected function will not raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is True.

This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
