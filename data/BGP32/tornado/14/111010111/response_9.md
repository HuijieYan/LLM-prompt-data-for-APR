### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current instance of IOLoop is already present, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The error message indicates that the code is raising a `RuntimeError` because it detects that a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
3. The issue seems to stem from the logic used to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance. The function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is used to check for an existing instance, but the condition checking whether it is `None` might not be correct. It should potentially be checking if it is not `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from incorrectly handling the condition for checking the presence of the current IOLoop instance. It should raise an error when the current instance is not `None` instead of when it is `None`.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the condition in the `initialize` function to raise a `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop instance already exists. This can be achieved by checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we changed the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance of IOLoop exists.
