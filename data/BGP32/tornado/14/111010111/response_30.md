### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class calls the `current` and `make_current` functions from the same class.
   - The `initialize` function sets the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

2. **Error Locations**:
   - The error occurs in the `initialize` function at line 253 where a `RuntimeError` is raised if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug arises from the logic check when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.
   - The bug is triggered because the code checks if a new `IOLoop` should be made current, but it does so before checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   - The expected behavior is to raise an error only if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Update the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before deciding whether to make the current instance.

5. **Corrected Version**:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By structuring the conditions in this way, the corrected function will first check if a current instance exists before attempting to make the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
