### Analyzing the buggy function and related information:

- Buggy function: `initialize(self, make_current=None)`
- Related functions: `current(instance=True)`, `make_current(self)`
- Error message: `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`
- Expected input/output values: `make_current=True`, expected to raise an error if current `IOLoop` already exists
- GitHub issue: Questioning why a `RuntimeError` is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None

### Error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if there is a current `IOLoop`. If there isn't, the `make_current` method is called.
2. The condition `if make_current` is used to handle the case where `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
3. However, there is a discrepancy in handling the case when a current `IOLoop` already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop`, and if it doesn't find one, it proceeds to either set the `make_current` flag or call `make_current` explicitly. However, when `make_current=True` is passed explicitly and there is already a current `IOLoop`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True` is passed explicitly and there is already a current `IOLoop`, it shouldn't raise an error. The behavior should be consistent with the intention of the flag, without affecting the existing flow of the `initialize` function.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `current_ioloop` is not `None` before attempting to set the current `IOLoop` again when `make_current=True`. This update ensures that the function behavior aligns with the expected logic based on the input parameters.
