### Bug Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:** The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting up the current IOLoop, and based on the parameter `make_current`, it should ensure whether to make the current IOLoop or raise an error if it already exists.
   
2. **Error Location:** The error occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` existing.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug arises because when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if a current IOLoop does not exist before setting itself as the current IOLoop. If it does exist, it throws an error indicating that a current IOLoop already exists.
   - The issue in the code is with the logic check for an existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`.

4. **Strategy to Fix the Bug:**
   - To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `initialize` function to accurately handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists.
   - We should modify the condition to raise an error only if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:  # Check if a current IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By incorporating the above corrected version of the `initialize` function, the issue where the error is incorrectly raised when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists will be resolved. This correction aligns the logic with the expected behavior based on the input parameters.
