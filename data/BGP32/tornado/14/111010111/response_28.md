### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**: The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop.py` file. This function is responsible for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` and making it current based on the `make_current` parameter.
   
2. **Buggy Code Explanation**:
   - The function checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is `None` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it calls `self.make_current()`.
   - If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The bug occurs because the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` is incorrect. It mistakenly checks if a current `IOLoop` does not exist before raising an error, which is opposite to the intended behavior.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - To fix the bug, we need to invert the logic for the `make_current=True` case. If `make_current` is `True`, we should raise an error only if there is already a current `IOLoop`. If there isn't, then we should call `self.make_current()`.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the logic for the `make_current=True` case is corrected, ensuring that it will raise an error only if there is already a current `IOLoop`.
