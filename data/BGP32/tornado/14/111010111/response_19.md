### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization logic based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it still raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The issue stems from a misunderstanding of the logic flow inside the `initialize` function. In the `elif make_current` block, it should only proceed to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods here ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should address the bug.
