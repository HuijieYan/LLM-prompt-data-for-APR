## Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` flag.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` flag is set to `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even though it shouldn't be raised according to the intended logic.
3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect check in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. This check should be inverted to stop the `RuntimeError` from being raised when the instance is not `None`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
2. Modify the check to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, indicating that a new current instance should not be created.

## Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these changes, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists without raising a `RuntimeError` inappropriately.
