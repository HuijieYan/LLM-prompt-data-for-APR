### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and only raises an error if it does not exist. This behavior is contradictory to the intended logic of checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before making it current.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and only make it current if not. Additionally, we need to raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the mentioned adjustments in the conditional checks, we ensure that the logic aligns with the expected behavior described in the function's docstring and resolves the bug causing the incorrect error to be raised.
