1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class sets the current `IOLoop` instance if needed, based on the `make_current` parameter.
   - The function uses the `IOLoop.current` function to check if a current instance already exists before setting a new one.
   - The failing test case expects that when `make_current=True`, an error should be raised if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   - The primary issue seems to be with how the function handles the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

2. Potential error locations:
   - The check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance within the `initialize` function.

3. Bug cause:
   - The bug occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.
   - The intent of the logic in the function is to either set the current `IOLoop` instance if none exists or raise an error if `make_current=True` and an instance is already present.

4. Fix strategy:
   - Update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. It should only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is an existing instance; otherwise, it should set the new instance.

5. Corrected function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the error is only raised if `make_current=True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, it sets the current instance appropriately.
