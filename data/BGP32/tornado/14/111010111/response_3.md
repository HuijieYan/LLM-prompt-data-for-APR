### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue is occurring when `make_current` is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
3. The bug arises from the condition check within the `initialize` function which raises the `RuntimeError` whenever `make_current` is `True`, regardless of the current instance's existence.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` AND the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to check if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before raising the `RuntimeError`.
2. Provide a corrective `if` condition to address the bug and ensure the `RuntimeError` is only raised when needed.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods here...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) and not make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding the conditional check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) and not make_current:`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists. This modification addresses the bug and aligns the behavior with the expected functionality.
