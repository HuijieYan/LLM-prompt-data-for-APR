### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` argument is provided and it is set to `True`, the function should make the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is not provided, it should make the current instance only if one does not already exist.
2. The failing test case provides a `make_current` argument with a value of `True`.
3. The issue arises because when `make_current=True`, the function checks if a current instance already exists and raises an error if it does. However, the intention seems to be to raise an error only if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and a current instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional check for `make_current` to correctly distinguish between `None` and `True`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional check in the `initialize` function to raise an error only if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Update the condition to check for True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for the current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check to explicitly check for `True` when `make_current` is provided, and checking for the existence of a current instance before raising an error, we resolve the bug and ensure the function behaves as expected.
