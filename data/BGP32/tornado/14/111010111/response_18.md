### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:** The `initialize` function initializes the `IOLoop` instance. It checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if it does.
   
2. **Error Location:** The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. The function incorrectly raises an error.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The buggy function checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, and if there isn't, it raises an error. However, the intention should be to raise an error if there is already a current instance, not when there isn't one.
   - The error message "current IOLoop already exists" is misleading because the error should actually be raised when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, not when it doesn't.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - In the case where `make_current=True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error in that scenario. If there is no current instance, it should set the current instance.
   - Update the logic to match the expected behavior where the error should only be raised when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists during initialization.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current()

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
