### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` appears to have an issue related to the conditions for `make_current` parameter. The failing test `test_force_current` is testing the behavior when `make_current=True` is passed, and it expects to raise a `RuntimeError` if trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the function causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when creating the first instance with `make_current=True`, which is incorrect. The test expects the `RuntimeError` to be raised only on the second attempt with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to separate the logic for handling the first instance creation and the subsequent instances correctly based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the condition inside the `elif make_current` block to check if a current instance exists before raising `RuntimeError`, the corrected function should pass the failing test.
