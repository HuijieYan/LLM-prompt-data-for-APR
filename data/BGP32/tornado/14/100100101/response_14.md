### Analysis
- The buggy function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object and set it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`.
- The bug in the function is that it doesn't correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance present.
- The failing test `test_force_current` constructs an IOLoop object with `make_current=True`, expects the new object to be set as the current IOLoop, and then checks if trying to construct another IOLoop object with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation
- The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
- The function should raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to set a new IOLoop instance as the current one if there is already one present.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to modify the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current IOLoop instance present when `make_current=True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if so.
- We can achieve this by checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before attempting to set the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case by properly handling the scenario when trying to set a new IOLoop instance as the current one.
