1. **Analysis:**
    - The buggy function `initialize` takes an optional parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`.
    - The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If so, it calls `self.make_current()`.
    - If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
    - There seems to be an issue with how the `make_current` parameter is handled in the function.

2. **Identified Error:**
    - The issue seems to be that when `make_current` is `True`, the function always raises a `RuntimeError` without actually creating a new `IOLoop` instance.

3. **Bug Cause:**
    - In the provided test function `test_force_current`, an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is created and stored in `self.io_loop`.
    - The first `IOLoop` instance is created successfully, but when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
    - Due to the bug in the `initialize` function, the `RuntimeError` is raised even for the first instance creation, which is incorrect behavior.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy:**
    - To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.
    - We should only raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.

5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
# Corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes to the `initialize` function, it should correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and prevent a `RuntimeError` from being raised during the creation of the first `IOLoop` instance. This should fix the bug and make the test function `test_force_current` pass as expected.
