### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist, based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The failing test `test_force_current` expects that trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when an IOLoop instance already exists should raise a `RuntimeError`.
- The current buggy function does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Error Location
- The bug lies in the `initialize` function's logic for handling the case when `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.
- The function should raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario, but the current implementation does not check for that condition properly.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test, when the initial `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, it becomes the current `IOLoop`.
- When the second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, the buggy function should detect that an existing current `IOLoop` instance is already present and raise a `RuntimeError`. However, it fails to do so, leading to a failed test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- We need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True` is provided.
- If an existing current `IOLoop` instance is detected, we should raise a `RuntimeError` to indicate that only one current `IOLoop` instance can exist.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    cur_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if cur_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if cur_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using the corrected version of the `initialize` function provided above, the failing test `test_force_current` should now pass as expected. The function will correctly handle the scenario when `make_current=True` and an existing current `IOLoop` instance is present, raising a `RuntimeError` accordingly.
