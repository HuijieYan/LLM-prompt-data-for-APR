### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the `make_current` parameter by checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists and if not, creating a new one. However, the buggy function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists correctly, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Explanation
When the test function `test_force_current` is executed with `make_current=True`, the buggy function fails to properly handle the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised even when it shouldn't be, causing the test to fail.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. We can achieve this by checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to create a new one when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected `initialize` function should now handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists correctly, resolving the bug and allowing the test to pass.
