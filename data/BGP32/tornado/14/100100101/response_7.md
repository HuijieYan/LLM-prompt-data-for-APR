### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object with the option to make it the current IOLoop. The bug seems to be in the conditional logic for setting the current IOLoop. The function is failing to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop object already exists.

### Error Location
The bug is likely in the logic that checks for an existing current IOLoop instance and attempts to make the current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug
In the failing test function `test_force_current`, the test case initially creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`. After that, it tries to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should lead to a `RuntimeError` since a current IOLoop instance already exists. However, the buggy function is not correctly handling this scenario.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, the function raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected.
