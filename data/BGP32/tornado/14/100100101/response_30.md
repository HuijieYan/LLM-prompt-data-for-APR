### Analysis
The `initialize` function is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. The bug seems to be occurring when trying to force the current `IOLoop` instance. The function checks if the current instance exists, and if not, it tries to make the current instance. However, the bug is triggered when attempting to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the logic inside the `initialize` function does not handle the case where a second instance is created with `make_current=True`. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` since the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but it fails to do so.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a second instance is created with `make_current=True`. This can be achieved by directly checking if the current instance is not `None` when `make_current=True`, and raising a `RuntimeError` accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing this corrected version, the `initialize` function will now properly handle the scenario when a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, and the test case provided (`test_force_current`) should pass successfully.
