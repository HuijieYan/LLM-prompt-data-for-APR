### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function first checks if `make_current` is `None` and then proceeds to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and only then calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the failing test case `test_force_current`, `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, which means that it should directly call `self.make_current()` without needing to go through the check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, `self.make_current()` is called directly without additional checks. We can simplify the logic by moving the check for `make_current` inside the `if` statement for `make_current is None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By fixing the function in this way, it will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and pass the failing test case mentioned above.
