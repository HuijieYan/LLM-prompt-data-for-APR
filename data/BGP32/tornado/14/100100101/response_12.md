### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is currently checking if `make_current` is `None` and then checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, as the function is not correctly handling this case, leading to a RuntimeError being raised even though it shouldn't.

### Bug Explanation
When `make_current` is `True`, the buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which should not happen in this case. This behavior is incorrect and results in the failing test `test_force_current` failing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic when `make_current` is `True` to ensure that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` existence check does not result in a `RuntimeError`. The function should check if the current IOLoop instance exists and only call `self.make_current()` if it does not.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the correction to the `initialize` function, it should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` without raising a `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop instance already exists. This correction should make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
