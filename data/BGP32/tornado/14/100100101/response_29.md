### Analysis
The issue in the buggy function `initialize` is that it doesn't correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` current instance already exists. The function should raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario. The bug is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to not raise an exception when it should.

### Bug Explanation
- The function `initialize` accepts a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean.
- The function checks if `make_current` is `True`, it should ensure that if an `IOLoop` current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, in the current implementation, it does not perform this check correctly, leading to the bug.

### Bug Fix
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new `IOLoop` current instance when one already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
