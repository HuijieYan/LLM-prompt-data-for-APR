### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` object based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue lies in the condition checks and the logic related to creating the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Explanation
When the `make_current` parameter is `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does not exist, it should create a new instance and set it as the current instance. However, due to the bug in the function, the logic is not correctly implemented. This leads to the test case failing because the second attempt to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError` instead of successfully creating and setting the current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the creation and setting of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The function needs to ensure that only one current `IOLoop` instance is created when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With the corrected version, the function should now properly handle the initialization process based on the `make_current` parameter, allowing the failing test case to pass successfully.
