### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the buggy `IOLoop` class has a logical error where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before deciding to make the current instance.
2. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the test case expects an error to be raised when trying to construct a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` after an existing current instance has been set.
3. The bug is in the logic of checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handling the `make_current` parameter.
4. To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to properly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance exists and the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when a current `IOLoop` instance exists and the `make_current` parameter is `True`. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case since a new current instance cannot be set when one already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current_instance is not None and make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected function will properly handle the case when `make_current=True` is passed and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
