### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should create a new instance only if one doesn't already exist, and raise an error if one does exist.
2. The bug seems to be in the handling of the `make_current` parameter when it is `True`.
3. In the failing test, `test_force_current`, the test expects the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case of trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance when one already exists.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is that the current `IOLoop` instance is not being properly set when `make_current` is `True`. The `initialize` function incorrectly allows the creation of a new instance even if one already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one when `make_current` is `True`.
2. Raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`.
3. Ensure that the current instance is set only when `make_current` is `True` and an instance doesn't already exist.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
