#### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` has an issue related to handling the `make_current` parameter. In the provided failing test case, the `IOLoop` object is instantiated with `make_current=True`, and then another attempt to instantiate a new `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` is made, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

#### Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition for checking if `make_current` is `True`. The current logic will always try to set `make_current` even if it's already set, leading to the `RuntimeError` not being raised as expected.

#### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to check if `make_current` is already set before trying to set it again. If `make_current` is already `True`, then raising a `RuntimeError` is the correct behavior.

#### Corrected version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After applying this fix, the function should now properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` already exists.
