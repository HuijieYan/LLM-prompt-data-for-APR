### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance is already current and if not, it tries to make the current IOLoop.
- In the failing test `test_force_current`, it constructs an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to construct a second instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError` as the current IOLoop already exists.

### Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. It tries to make the IOLoop current even if it is already current, leading to the RuntimeError not being raised as expected in the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. We should only try to make the IOLoop current if it is not already the current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should pass the failing test `test_force_current` and work as expected.
