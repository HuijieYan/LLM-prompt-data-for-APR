### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. It should check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one.
2. The bug seems to be in the conditional checks within the `initialize` function. It incorrectly handles the logic for creating a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when one already exists should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before creating a new one.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            
        self.make_current()
```

By properly checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one, the corrected `initialize` function should pass the failing test provided.
