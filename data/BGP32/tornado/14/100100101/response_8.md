### Explanation of the bug
The buggy `initialize` function fails to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`. The bug causes the function to mistakenly raise a `RuntimeError` when a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`. This behavior deviates from the expected functionality as specified in the failing test, where the second `make_current=True` construction should not succeed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional statement in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test scenario provided.
