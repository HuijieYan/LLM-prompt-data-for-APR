### Analysis
- The `initialize` function is expected to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter to ensure only one current IOLoop instance exists.
- The buggy function currently compares `make_current` to `None`, which may not work as intended.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test case, `test_force_current`, the test creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True` again. 
- The buggy function's logic does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. As a result, the test case expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised in the second instance creation, but the buggy function does not trigger it.
- The current bug allows the creation of a second current IOLoop instance when it should not be allowed.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.
- The fix should ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised when attempting to create a new instance with `make_current=True` if a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
