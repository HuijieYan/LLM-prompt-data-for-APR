### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is checking the value of `make_current` and if it is `None` or `True`, it is trying to make the current IOLoop instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, as it raises a `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop already exists. This prevents the test case from passing.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test case `test_force_current`, the initial IOLoop instance is created with `make_current=True`. Then, another IOLoop instance is attempted to be created with `make_current=True` again, triggering the `RuntimeError` as the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior of the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` but the current IOLoop instance already exists without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` before returning, we can prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised when trying to make the current IOLoop instance. This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case.
