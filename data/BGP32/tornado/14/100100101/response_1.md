### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in ioloop.py has an issue where the `make_current` parameter is not being handled correctly.
2. The `initialize` function should make the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is True and no current IOLoop instance already exists. If `make_current` is None, it should make the current IOLoop instance if no current instance exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` calls the `IOLoop` constructor with `make_current=True` and expects the current IOLoop instance to be set correctly. It then tries to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. The bug causes the `initialize` function to not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop instance already exists.
5. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one when `make_current` is True.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version checks whether a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one when `make_current` is True. This ensures that the behavior aligns with the expected values during the failing test execution.
