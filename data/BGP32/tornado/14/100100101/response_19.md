### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` object with the option to force it as the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the bug occurs when trying to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs because the code incorrectly assumes that if `make_current` is `True`, the current `IOLoop` instance must already exist. This assumption leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even if no current `IOLoop` instance exists yet.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance is already present.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if a current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. This corrected version should pass the failing test scenario provided.
