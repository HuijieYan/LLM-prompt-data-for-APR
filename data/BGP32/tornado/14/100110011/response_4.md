### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and then either make it the current instance or raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists. The issue arises with the implementation of the logic for handling the `make_current` argument.

### Identified Errors:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` should check if `make_current` is `True` or `False`, not `None`.
2. The condition `if make_current:` should only execute if `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is in the incorrect implementation of the conditions in the `initialize` function. The current logic does not correctly handle the `make_current` argument, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when a current IOLoop already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the conditions for checking the `make_current` argument need to be adjusted. The checks should be based on the values of `True` and `False` instead of `None`. Additionally, the logic for handling `make_current` should be updated to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these adjustments to the conditions in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed and the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
