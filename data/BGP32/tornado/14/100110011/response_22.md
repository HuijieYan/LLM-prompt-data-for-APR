### Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize` checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it initializes a new one. However, the bug arises when `make_current` is set to `True` because it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when no current `IOLoop` instance exists. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality.

The failing test function `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should fail with a `RuntimeError` due to the existing current instance. However, the buggy function fails to handle this scenario properly, leading to the error message stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists when it does not.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic within the `initialize` function to accurately handle the case where `make_current=True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists. This can be achieved by properly checking the existing `IOLoop` instance before raising a `RuntimeError`.

### The corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking the value of `current_instance` before raising an error, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current=True` is specified. This correction aligns the function's behavior with the intended functionality and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
