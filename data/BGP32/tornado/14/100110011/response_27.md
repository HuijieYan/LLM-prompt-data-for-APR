### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is responsible for checking if a current IOLoop instance exists and creating a new one if necessary.
2. The failing test scenario `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is testing the initialization of an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised even though the current IOLoop instance is None at the beginning of the function.
4. The GitHub issue points out that there is confusion around line 252 in `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for None but still raises an error.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the condition where the RuntimeError is raised inside the `initialize` function. The logic is flawed and inconsistent with the initial check for the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance is incorrect. It checks for None at the beginning but still raises an error if `make_current` is True, even if there is no current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition for raising the RuntimeError needs to be adjusted. If `make_current` is True and there is no current IOLoop instance, the instance should be created without raising an error. Only raise the error if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By following the corrected version of the `initialize` function provided above, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
