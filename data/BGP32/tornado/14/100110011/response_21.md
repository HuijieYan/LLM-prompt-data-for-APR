### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a logical error in the `if` condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None before creating a new one.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting an assertion error due to the already existing `IOLoop` instance.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised despite the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to the test failure.
4. To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
5. The corrected version of the function will properly handle the scenario when a current `IOLoop` instance is already present.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `make_current` flag is `True`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, raise the `RuntimeError`.
2. If the `make_current` flag is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, then create a new `IOLoop` instance.
3. If the `make_current` flag is `None`, and no `IOLoop` instance currently exists, execute `self.make_current()` to create a new `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the logic to check for the presence of an existing `IOLoop` instance before creating a new one is corrected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
