### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize()` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The failing test is `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised when trying to create an additional IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 in `ioloop.py` where it checks `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` for `None` but still raises an "already exists" error.

### Bug Cause:
In the buggy `initialize()` function, checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before either making the current IOLoop or raising an error is causing the problem. The issue arises when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` while another instance already exists, resulting in the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize()` function to properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists. One way to approach this is to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and based on that, decide whether to proceed with creating a new instance or raise an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic as shown above, we first check if there is an existing IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
