### Error Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` tries to test the case where `make_current=True` to force the current IOLoop.
3. The failing test tries to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists.
4. The specific issue highlighted on GitHub questions the logic in line 252 of the `initialize` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists correctly. The failing test expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if a new IOLoop is initialized with `make_current=True` when the current IOLoop already exists. However, the buggy function does not check the existing IOLoop status properly, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle the scenario where the current IOLoop already exists. This can be achieved by checking if the current IOLoop is already initialized before attempting to force the creation of a new one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, the code will now properly check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to initialize a new one with `make_current=True`. This change should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test pass successfully.
