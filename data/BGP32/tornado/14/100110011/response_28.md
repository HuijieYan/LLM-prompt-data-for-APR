### Error Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object, specifically managing the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop object with `make_current=True` and expects an `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a second IOLoop object with `make_current=True`.
3. The failing test is triggering the error because if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it should raise an error.
4. The buggy function does not handle the case properly when `make_current` is True and the current instance of IOLoop already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because, inside the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, it fails to raise the `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test, resulting in the test failing.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
- Check if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value, then raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change made here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the function should handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop object already exists. This should make the failing test `test_force_current` pass and resolve the issue reported on GitHub as well.
