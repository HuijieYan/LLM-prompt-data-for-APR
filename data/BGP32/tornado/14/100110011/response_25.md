### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance with an optional parameter `make_current`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is testing the behavior of creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and checking for the expected behavior.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current=True` even if the current IOLoop already exists. This behavior contradicts the expectation of the test.
4. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the logic at line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for None, and then a RuntimeError is raised for existing IOLoop.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect check in the `initialize` function. The function currently raises a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which is not the intended behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. We should only raise a RuntimeError if there is an existing IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case when creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and correctly check for the presence of an existing IOLoop instance before raising a RuntimeError.
