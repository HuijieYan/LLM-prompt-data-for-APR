### Fixing the Bug:

1. **Error Location:** The bug is likely occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.

2. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - In the provided `initialize` method, when `make_current` is `True`, it immediately checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is, the method raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the "current IOLoop already exists".
   - The issue arises because the `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True` before checking if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

3. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - To fix the bug, we should first check if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` is passed. If there is an existing instance, raise the `RuntimeError` as expected. Otherwise, proceed with creating the new `IOLoop` instance.

4. **Corrected Version of the Function:**

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the function, the `initialize` method first checks for an existing `IOLoop` instance before attempting to create a new one when `make_current=True`.

By implementing this correction, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError` for an existing `IOLoop` instance.
