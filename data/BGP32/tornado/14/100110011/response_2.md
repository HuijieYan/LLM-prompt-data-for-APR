### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is designed to set up the IOLoop instance. It checks if `make_current` is provided, and based on its value, either makes the current IOLoop instance or raises an error if one already exists.
2. The failing test in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to become the current instance. Subsequently, it tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised because the current IOLoop already exists, even though the expectation was that it would be None. This mismatch causes the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` check within the `initialize` function is correctly checking for the presence of the current IOLoop instance. Currently, it does not work as expected.
5. By modifying the behavior of the `initialize` function and its `IOLoop.current` checks, we can address the bug.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that if the current IOLoop already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised immediately. This modification aligns with the expected behavior as per the failing test case and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
