### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is failing with a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which is already set to True for the existing `io_loop` instance, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug arises from the fact that the code does not handle the case where `make_current=True` is already set for an existing `IOLoop` instance, causing the error.
5. The strategy to fix the bug is to modify the `initialize` method to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists with `make_current=True` before creating a new instance.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance:
            if current_instance._make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists with make_current=True")
    
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding an additional check to see if an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` already exists, the bug is fixed. This modification ensures that a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` cannot be created if one already exists.
