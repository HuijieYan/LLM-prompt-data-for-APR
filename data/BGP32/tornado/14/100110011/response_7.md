### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. 
2. The issue seems to be occurring when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but expects the process to raise a `RuntimeError` since the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The error occurs in the `initialize` method when checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set and raising a `RuntimeError`.
5. The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic in the `initialize` method to properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.


### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is set to `True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance, raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. Update the logic to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is only set if it doesn't already exist.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic is adjusted to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to set it as the current instance. If `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised. This change should address the issue and make the failing test pass successfully.
