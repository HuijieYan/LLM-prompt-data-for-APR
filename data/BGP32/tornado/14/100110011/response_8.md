### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance, specifically handling the `make_current` parameter. The test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is designed to test the behavior when `make_current=True`. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when it should not.

### Error Location:
The error appears to be occurring in the `initialize` method when the condition `make_current` is True, but the check for an existing IOLoop instance leads to the erroneous RuntimeError being raised.

### Explanation:
The bug arises from a faulty condition check in the `initialize` method. It incorrectly raises a RuntimeError based on the check for an existing IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`, causing the test to fail. The issue on GitHub highlights the confusion around this condition, which needs clarification.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. Instead of checking for an already existing IOLoop instance to raise an error, it should simply set the current IOLoop instance to the current object being initialized.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The correct version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        # Set the current IOLoop instance
        IOLoop.make_current(self)
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current=True`, the `IOLoop.make_current()` method is called on the current object being initialized instead of raising a RuntimeError if an existing IOLoop instance is detected. This change should resolve the bug and make the `test_force_current` test pass successfully.
