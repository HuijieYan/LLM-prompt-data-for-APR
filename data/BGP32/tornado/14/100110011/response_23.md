### Analyzing the Bug

The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing or not. The issue is related to line 252 where it is checking if the current instance is `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`. However, the test case `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` expects that creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists. This discrepancy results in a failure in the test case.

The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists even though the code is explicitly trying to create one. This inconsistency is the cause of the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the condition checking for `None` at line 252 in the `initialize` method needs to be revised. Instead of checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it should check if a current instance already exists when `make_current=True`. This adjustment will align the behavior of the function with the expectation of the test case.

### Corrected Version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`, resolving the issue reported on GitHub and allowing the failing test case to pass successfully.
