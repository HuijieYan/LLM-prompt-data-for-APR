### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for handling the initialization and current instance management of the IOLoop.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, which is contradictory to the expected behavior.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the confusion around the logic in line 252 where the condition should be checked properly.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function `initialize` in the IOLoop class is checking if the current IOLoop instance is None before creating another instance when `make_current=True`. However, the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It raises a RuntimeError when a current IOLoop instance already exists, which contradicts the expected behavior.
In the failing test `test_force_current`, the test is checking the behavior where a new IOLoop instance is created with `make_current=True` and expects an error when a second instance is created with the same flag.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to raise a RuntimeError only when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.
2. Modify the condition to check if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop instance is not None, then raise the RuntimeError.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition to check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition check in the `initialize` function, the RuntimeError will only be raised when a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True`, aligning with the expected behavior in the failing test. This correction will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
