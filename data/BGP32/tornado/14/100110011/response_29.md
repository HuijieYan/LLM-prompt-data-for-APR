### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking if the current IOLoop exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. 
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` explicitly tries to call `IOLoop(make_current=True)` twice, which should raise a `RuntimeError` for the second call.
3. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function raises `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop already exists, which is expected behavior.
4. The bug lies in the fact that the `make_current` method is not being called when it should be, leading to the incorrect comparison of the current IOLoop existence.
5. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` method is called properly based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that:
- If `make_current` is `None`, the `make_current` method should be called.
- If `make_current` is `True`, the `make_current` method should be called only if the current IOLoop does not exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

By making this correction, the `make_current` method will be called correctly based on the `make_current` parameter, ensuring proper initialization of the IOLoop and preventing the `RuntimeError` when the current IOLoop already exists. This will resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
