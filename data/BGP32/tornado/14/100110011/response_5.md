### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance. It checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and then makes it current if needed.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another one, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly due to the check for an existing current IOLoop instance being inappropriately placed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the check for an existing current IOLoop instance is done correctly and that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.


### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the check for an existing current IOLoop instance is incorrectly placed within the `initialize` function. The check should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and the current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the check for the existing current IOLoop instance should be moved inside the `elif make_current:` block to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to make the current IOLoop instance, and it already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this corrective change, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and raise a `RuntimeError` only when necessary, allowing the failing test to pass successfully.
