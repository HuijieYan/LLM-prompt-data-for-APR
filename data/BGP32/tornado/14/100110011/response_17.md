### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The failing test case is `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when it shouldn't, based on the condition in the code.
4. The cause of the bug seems to be that the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop is incorrect, leading to the premature raising of the RuntimeError.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring because in the `initialize` function, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is evaluating to False, even when it should be True. This results in the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when attempting to force the current IOLoop.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition check in the `initialize` function to correctly determine if the current IOLoop instance exists.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` method is called only when it is intended based on the given parameters.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current == True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now correctly handle the initialization of the IOLoop and avoid raising the `RuntimeError` when it is not necessary.
