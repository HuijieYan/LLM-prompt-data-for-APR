### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is checking if `make_current` is `True` and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then check if the current `IOLoop` instance is the same.
3. The failing test expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True` when the current instance already exists.
4. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is indeed being raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, which is incorrect according to the expected behavior.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused because the `initialize` function in the buggy code raises a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, even if `make_current` is `True`. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior as per the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is `True` first and then raise a `RuntimeError` only if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change to the `initialize` function, the corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
