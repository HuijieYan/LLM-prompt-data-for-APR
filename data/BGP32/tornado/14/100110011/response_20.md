### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before creating a new one with the `make_current` option.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is testing the behavior when trying to force the creation of a current `IOLoop`.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance even though one already exists.
4. The GitHub issue highlights the confusion regarding the behavior at line 252 of `ioloop.py` based on the error occurring.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before proceeding to create a new one with `make_current`. However, this check is not accurate as it does not consider the `make_current` flag.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check whether to proceed with creating a new `IOLoop` instance based on both the existence of an instance and the `make_current` flag.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function in tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check to consider both the existence of an instance and the `make_current` flag, the corrected version of the function should now handle the scenario correctly.
