### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object, including checking if a current IOLoop instance exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is trying to construct multiple IOLoop instances with `make_current=True` and expecting a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.
3. The error occurs when the `initialize` function raises `RuntimeError` even when `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current() is not None` in the failing test.
4. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 (`tornado/ioloop.py`) where the `RuntimeError` is raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrectly handling the case where `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, leading to the premature `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. The `initialize` function should check if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists before raising a `RuntimeError`.
2. Modify the logic to only raise `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the logic in the `initialize` function as above, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
