### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking if the current IOLoop instance exists or not before calling `make_current()`. If `make_current` parameter is `True` and a current instance of IOLoop already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` twice. The second attempt should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the second attempt to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` is failing because the current IOLoop instance already exists, which triggers the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring because the initial IOLoop instance is being created with `make_current=True`, and then the second instance is also getting created with `make_current=True`, without checking if an IOLoop instance is already present. This leads to the `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the check for an existing IOLoop instance will prevent the second instance from being created with `make_current=True` when one already exists. This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass successfully.
