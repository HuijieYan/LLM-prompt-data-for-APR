### Fixing the Bug:

#### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is not handling the case where `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly, as the current IOLoop does actually exist.

#### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function so that it correctly handles the case when `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

#### Changes Made:
1. I have stored the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` for better readability and to prevent multiple evaluations.
2. I have modified the check for `make_current=True` to ensure that if `current_instance` is not `None`, then a `RuntimeError` is raised as intended.

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
