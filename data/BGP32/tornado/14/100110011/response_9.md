### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance. It checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and makes it the current instance if needed. The issue seems to stem from the handling of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` sets `make_current=True` when initializing the IOLoop instance. It expects that the second attempt to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is improperly raising a `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`. This error doesn't align with the intended behavior of the test.
4. The cause of the bug could be due to the logic in the `initialize` function incorrectly evaluating that the current IOLoop instance exists when it should proceed with making the current instance.
5. To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and only raise a `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the code properly checks the current IOLoop instance before deciding to make it the current instance or raising a `RuntimeError` when a current instance already exists. This adjustment should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the function behave as expected based on the failing test.
