### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is expecting a parameter `make_current` which is used to determine whether to make the current IOLoop instance.
2. The issue seems to be related to the logic of checking if an IOLoop instance already exists or not.
3. The failing test is trying to create two IOLoop instances with `make_current=True`, which should raise an error when the current IOLoop instance already exists.
4. The error is occurring because the current instance check is happening incorrectly in the `initialize` method.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The current IOLoop instance check is being done using `instance=False`, which is not appropriate. The condition check should be based on whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the current IOLoop instance check is performed. Instead of checking if the instance is `None`, we should check if the current instance already exists when trying to make the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function will correctly check if the current IOLoop instance exists and raise an error if trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True` when an instance is already present. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
