### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `True` and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current instance and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".
2. The failing test is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, causing the check to fail and lead to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize()` function. The condition to raise an error should be when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance but `make_current` is requested.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize()` function to check if there is an existing `IOLoop` instance only when `make_current` is requested.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Adjust the conditional statements in the `initialize()` function to properly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and handle the case where `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Adjusted condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustment above, the function will properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is requested and raise an error only if there is already a current instance.
