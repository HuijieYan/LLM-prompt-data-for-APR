### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it is not set and `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it also checks and sets the `IOLoop` instance.
2. The error occurs during the test when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, and the `if` block condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` is not properly handling it. It raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists even when it is explicitly requested.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set explicitly to `True`, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition to handle the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists without raising an error.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we can avoid raising the misleading `RuntimeError`. This change ensures that the function behaves as expected without causing errors for explicitly setting `make_current` to `True`.
