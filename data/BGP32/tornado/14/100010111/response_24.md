### Identify the Bug:

The bug in the `initialize` function occurs when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists".

### Cause of the Bug:

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an existing IOLoop instance is already present. The function incorrectly raises an error even when the existing IOLoop instance is not causing any conflict.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. If an existing IOLoop instance is already present and `make_current` is `True`, we should skip the creation of a new IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            return  # Skip creating new IOLoop if current instance exists
        self.make_current()
```

By incorporating the logic to check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`, the corrected function should no longer incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError`. This corrected version addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report as well.
