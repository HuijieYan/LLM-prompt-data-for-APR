### 1. Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the current IOLoop instance already exists, a RuntimeError is raised.
- The expected behavior is that when `make_current` is `True`, the IOLoop instance should be initialized, but if it already exists, a RuntimeError should be raised.
- The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 in `ioloop.py` regarding the check for the current IOLoop instance.

### 2. Error Location
The bug is likely located in the `elif make_current` block where it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists but then raises a RuntimeError if it does. This conflicts with the intended behavior.

### 3. Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the inconsistency in the logic of checking for the current IOLoop instance. The function should only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists, not when trying to check its existence.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `elif make_current` block so that it only raises a RuntimeError if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists. The check for the existence of the current instance should not trigger an exception.

### 5. Corrected Version

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will first check if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists, and only then raise a RuntimeError. Otherwise, it will proceed with initializing the IOLoop instance.
