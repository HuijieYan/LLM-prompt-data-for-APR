## Bug Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is designed to initialize an IOLoop instance. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

## Error Cause
The bug arises from the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before making a current loop. However, when `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it should ensure that the current loop does not already exist regardless of the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic of the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, we should first check if the current loop already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` appropriately. Then, proceed to make the current loop only if it does not exist.

## Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic to check if the current loop exists before attempting to make it current, the corrected function will prevent the `RuntimeError` when the current loop is already in place.
