Based on the provided information, the bug in the `initialize` function arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists". 

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `initialize` function when the condition `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function should only raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists when attempting to make the current IOLoop, but it is erroneously checking for the absence of an IOLoop instance.

### Fixing Strategy:
To resolve this issue, the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop when `make_current` is `True` needs to be adjusted. If the current IOLoop instance already exists, the function should raise an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to check if the existing IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now handle the case appropriately and pass the failing test case.
