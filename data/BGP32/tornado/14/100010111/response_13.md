### Analyzing the buggy function and error message

The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and calls `make_current` if it doesn't. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. 

The failing test is trying to force the creation of a new IOLoop instance using `IOLoop(make_current=True)`, but it fails with a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

### Identifying potential error locations

- The issue may be related to the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` check not working as expected.
- The `make_current` check might not properly distinguish between the conditions of creating a new IOLoop instance.
- The logic to handle the `make_current` parameter needs to be revised.

### Cause of the bug

The bug arises from the logic in the function not properly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. If the current IOLoop instance already exists, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of creating a new instance.

### Fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic properly distinguishes between the situations when `make_current` is `None` and when it is `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, the function should proceed with creating a new IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed to simplify the logic for checking make_current
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle the condition where `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that a new IOLoop instance is only created if one does not already exist.
