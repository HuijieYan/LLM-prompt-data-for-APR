### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is meant to set the current IOLoop instance under certain conditions. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, it should set the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current instance only if there is no existing current instance.
2. The error message indicates that when calling the function with `make_current=True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not check whether the current IOLoop already exists before trying to make it the current one. This results in the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements to correctly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance already exists.
  
### Proposed Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking the `current_instance` value before attempting to set the current IOLoop, we can avoid raising the error incorrectly. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle the existing current IOLoop instance correctly.
