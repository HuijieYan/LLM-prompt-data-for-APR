### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an IOLoop instance with a flag `make_current` that indicates whether the new IOLoop instance should be set as the current one. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is already set. In this case, a `RuntimeError` is raised incorrectly.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The `if make_current is None` condition may not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
2. The logic inside the `elif make_current` block may be incorrect.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` instead of checking if it already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `elif make_current` block. It should check if an IOLoop instance is already set as current before attempting to make the new instance current.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before trying to set a new one as current. This should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
