### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `True` and if the current `IOLoop` does not exist, it is raising a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which triggers the `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is caused by checking for the absence of the current `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`, instead of checking for its presence. This results in an incorrect error message being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to reverse the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` to check if the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the correct error message is raised only when the `IOLoop` already exists.
