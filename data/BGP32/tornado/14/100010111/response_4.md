### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to initialize an `IOLoop` object with an optional parameter `make_current`. The function checks if an `IOLoop` is already the current instance, and if it is not, it sets the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Identified issue
The issue is arising when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, indicating that the `IOLoop` object should be set as the current instance. However, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists" even if an `IOLoop` object is not currently set as the current instance.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function is incorrectly raising the `RuntimeError` exception when `make_current` is set to `True` without verifying if an `IOLoop` object is already the current instance.

### Fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise the `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the function with this corrected version, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when trying to set an `IOLoop` object as the current instance when one is already set. This change should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case.
