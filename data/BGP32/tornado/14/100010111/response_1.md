Based on the given information, the buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization logic based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

### Analysis:
1. The bug is triggered when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `True` and then verifies if an `IOLoop` instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by checking if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` inside the `elif` block intended for `make_current=True`, leading to an incorrect error message being raised when an instance already exists.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should remove the second check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` under the `elif` block when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the correction above, the function should now correctly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists only when `make_current` is `True`. This fix should address the bug and allow the corrected function to pass the failing test case mentioned.
