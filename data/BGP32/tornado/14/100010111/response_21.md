### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before making it the current one, and if `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The error message indicates that the error occurs when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is incorrect, leading to the wrong `RuntimeError` being raised when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. To fix this bug, we need to adjust how the existing `IOLoop` instance is checked before raising an error when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking the existing `IOLoop` instance before checking `make_current`, we ensure that the correct `RuntimeError` is raised when needed.
