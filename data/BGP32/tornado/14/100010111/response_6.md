### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, then proceeds to make it the current instance. If the `make_current` parameter is set to True, it checks again for the current instance and raises an error if it is not None, which is contradictory.
   
2. The error message indicates that the code is trying to force the current IOLoop instance even when one already exists, leading to the RuntimeError message.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the contradictory logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current IOLoop instance, it still tries to make it the current instance again, resulting in the RuntimeError message.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic by only checking if the `make_current` parameter is True and a current IOLoop instance already exists, then raise an error. Otherwise, proceed to make it the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
