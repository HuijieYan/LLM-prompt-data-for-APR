### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is meant to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance, with an optional parameter `make_current`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, which contradicts the intention of setting `make_current` to bring the current instance into focus.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the `RuntimeError` raising logic for this case and simply make the current instance active without checking if it already exists.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```  

This corrected version removes the `RuntimeError` raising condition and always makes the current instance active when `make_current` is `True`.
