### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with an option to make it the current instance.
2. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the issue occurs at line 253 when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.
4. The bug occurs because the function is checking for the current `IOLoop` instance twice unnecessarily and leads to the incorrect error being raised.
5. To fix this bug, we should remove the redundant check for the current `IOLoop` instance and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By simplifying the logic in the `initialize` function and removing the unnecessary check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, we can address the bug and ensure that the correct error handling is applied.
