### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then either calls `self.make_current()` or raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The error message indicates that the test scenario is trying to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` instance even though one already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function is incorrectly handling the case when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, resulting in the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current_instance is not None and make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By adding an explicit check to see if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True`, we prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised when attempting to create a new instance. This updated logic ensures that the function behaves as expected in the test scenario.
