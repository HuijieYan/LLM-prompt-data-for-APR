### Analysis:
1. **Error:** The error message indicates that a RuntimeError is raised because the IOLoop.current() instance is already existing, even when it is being checked for existence with `is None`.
   
2. **Bug Location:** The bug is in the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug occurs because the current IOLoop instance is being checked incorrectly, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised when it should not have been.
   - The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not accurately checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - The condition to check the existence of the current IOLoop instance needs to be modified to ensure the correct behavior.
   - Using `if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None` will accurately check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the function will accurately check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and avoid raising the RuntimeError when unnecessary.
