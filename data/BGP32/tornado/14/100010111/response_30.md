### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop instance. It checks if `make_current` is `None`, then checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before calling `make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not.
   
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, which is unexpected according to the logic of the function.

3. The bug seems to be in the condition when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, causing the RuntimeError to be raised.

### Bug Cause
In the buggy function:
- When `make_current` is `True`, the code is checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`. This condition should be checking if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` instead.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` should be changed to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` instead of checking if it is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the bug causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly should be resolved.
