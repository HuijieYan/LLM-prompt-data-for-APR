### Analyzing the buggy function
The buggy function `initialize` checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it calls the `make_current()` method. However, there is an issue in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of checking `make_current` again.

### Error Location
The error occurs in the `initialize` function when handling the `make_current` parameter and checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists even though the `make_current` parameter was set to `True`. This behavior contradicts the expected logic of creating a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

The corrected version of the function adjusts the logic to first check if `make_current` is None or True. If so, it then checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it calls `make_current()`. If `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected. This corrected version aligns with the expected behavior and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
