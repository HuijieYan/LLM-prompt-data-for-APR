The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object based on the `make_current` argument. However, there is an issue where if `make_current` is set to `True`, it will raise a `RuntimeError` even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is actually returning `None`.

### Error Location:
The issue arises in the logic within the `initialize` function, specifically in the `elif make_current:` block. This block is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to a logic flaw in handling the `make_current` argument. The intention is to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the condition check is incorrect, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError` even in cases where no `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks based on the logic we want to achieve. Specifically, we should only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. We should not raise the error if no current instance exists.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` argument correctly, raising a `RuntimeError` only when there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is set to `True`. This version will pass the failing test case and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
