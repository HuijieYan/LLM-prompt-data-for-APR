The bug in the `initialize` function arises due to a logic error in checking the current state of the IOLoop instance. The issue is related to how the function handles the case when `make_current` is `True`.

The cause of the bug can be explained step by step:
1. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the test case expects that when `make_current` is `True`, the `IOLoop` instance should be set as the current instance.
2. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` function incorrectly checks if the current instance is `None` even when `make_current` is `True`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. This incorrect check leads to the premature failure of the test, as the expected behavior is for the `IOLoop` instance to be made current when `make_current` is `True`.

To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, the logic for checking the current instance should be adjusted:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current instance is not `None`, we ensure that the `IOLoop` instance is only set as the current instance when `make_current` is explicitly `True`.

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and satisfy the expected input/output values.
