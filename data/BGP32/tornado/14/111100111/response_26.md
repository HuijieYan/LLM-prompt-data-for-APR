The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a problem where it is incorrectly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. The issue arises because if `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if the current instance is `None` and then proceeds to raise an error if it is not `None`, which is contradictory.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, we are now correctly checking if the current instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, and then raising an error if it is not `None, thereby fixing the bug present in the original function.

With this corrected function, the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
