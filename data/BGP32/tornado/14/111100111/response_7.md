## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current instance. However, there is a bug in the logic that checks if an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` and tries to make the current instance if none exists using the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is set to True, it checks if there is already a current instance and raises an error if there is.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current` is set to True, it should correctly handle making the IOLoop instance current and prevent multiple instances from being set as the current one.
4. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to True but there is already a current instance present.

## Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the incorrect condition in the `initialize` function where it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists. In the case where `make_current` is set to True, it should check for the presence of a current instance, but the condition is incorrect and does not check this properly. This leads to the RuntimeError being incorrectly raised when there is already a current instance.

## Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the condition in the `initialize` function where `make_current` is True to correctly check if there is already a current instance. By modifying this condition, we can ensure that the function behaves as expected by the failing test.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
