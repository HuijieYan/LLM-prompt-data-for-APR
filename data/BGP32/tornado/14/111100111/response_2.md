## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue where it checks for the current instance incorrectly and does not handle the `make_current` argument properly.
2. The issue is with the logic of how the current instance is checked and handled based on the `make_current` argument.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function, where it checks for the presence of a current instance and tries to set a new instance based on the `make_current` argument. In the failing test, when `make_current=True` is passed, the function fails to correctly handle the case where a current instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to refactor the logic within the `initialize` function to only create a new instance if `make_current=True` and no current instance already exists. Otherwise, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Fix
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` in the `initialize` function, we fix the bug. This change ensures that if a current instance already exists and `make_current=True`, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test case provided.
