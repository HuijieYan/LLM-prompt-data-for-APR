### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic within the `initialize` function that checks the current `IOLoop` instance and whether to make the current instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance in the system.
4. The issue on GitHub points out the confusion with the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect interpretation of the logic in the `initialize` function related to the existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy:
1. Modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current instance.
2. Ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when it is appropriate, according to the requirements of the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the modifications above, the bug in the `initialize` function should be fixed, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass as expected.
