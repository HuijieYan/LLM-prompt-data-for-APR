### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is used to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. The condition `elif make_current:` is used to check if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.
3. The `RuntimeError` is raised if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the `else` block handling this condition does not consider the scenario when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the handling of the `make_current` parameter within the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the code does not properly handle this scenario by calling `self.make_current()` after checking for an existing instance. As a result, the `RuntimeError` is raised without making the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is set to `True`, if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, the existing instance becomes the current instance. This can be achieved by calling `self.make_current()` after checking for an existing instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that when `make_current` is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is detected, the current instance is properly set without raising a `RuntimeError`. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
