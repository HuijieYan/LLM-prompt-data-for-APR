## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function checks the `make_current` parameter and calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to see if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. If `make_current` is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current instance.
4. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks for a current instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is one.
5. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error when trying to create another one with the same setting.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is performed incorrectly in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, it should raise an error only if there is no current instance. Instead, it raises an error unconditionally if there is already a current instance.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` in the `initialize` function. It should only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
