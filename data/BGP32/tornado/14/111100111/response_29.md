### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a bug related to the logic of checking the current instance.
2. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None`, then it verifies if the current instance is `None` using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function. If it is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if the current instance is `None`, processes as required, but for the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None,` it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. It then checks for the current instance using `IOLoop.current()` and ensures that it matches the initialized instance. The failing aspect is that it expects a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`, but the current function additionally should not exist while creating the second instance.
4. The bug is due to the conditional checks in the `initialize` function not handling the scenario where `make_current` is `True` but the current instance already exists.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
2. Add a check to verify if a current instance already exists with `make_current=True` and raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Now, the corrected `initialize` function will properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` in that situation.
