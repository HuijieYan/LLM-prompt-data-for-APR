### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current` is set to `True`, a new `IOLoop` instance is created and set as the current one. Subsequently, it expects an error to be raised when attempting to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The issue reported on GitHub questions the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py`, where it seems contradictory to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then raise an error for an existing instance.
4. The bug in the function is that it raises an error "current IOLoop already exists" even when the current instance is `None`.

### Error Cause:
The bug lies in the logic of checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when setting `make_current` to `True`. The current implementation incorrectly raises an error if the current instance is `None`, which contradicts the expected behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic of the `initialize` function to only raise an error if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance when setting `make_current` to `True`.
2. If there is no current instance and `make_current=True`, create a new `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and reflect the expected behavior as described.
