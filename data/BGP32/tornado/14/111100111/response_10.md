The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the logic for checking the current instance of the `IOLoop` class. The issue arises in the case where `make_current=True`, and it is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when the current instance is `None`.

### Explanation of the Bug:
1. In the `initialize` function, when `make_current=True` is passed, it checks if the current instance is `None`. If it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. However, in the failing test `test_force_current`, the intention is to force setting the current `IOLoop` instance, and if it already exists, it should still set the new instance as the current one.
3. The bug is that the logic in `initialize` is inconsistent with the expected behavior in the test case. It should set the current instance to the new instance even if there is already an existing one.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to set the current instance to the new instance regardless of whether there is an existing instance or not when `make_current=True` is passed.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function will correctly set the current instance of `IOLoop` to the new instance when `make_current=True`. This updated logic aligns with the expectation in the failing test case.
