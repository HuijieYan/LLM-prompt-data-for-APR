## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by making it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, it attempts to make the current instance only if no current instance already exists. If it is `False`, it does nothing.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks whether the `IOLoop` instance created with `make_current=True` becomes the current instance and ensures that a second attempt to create a current instance fails.
3. The bug in the current implementation occurs at the `elif make_current` condition, where it should only raise an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, indicating the current instance already exists.
   
## Bug Explanation
- In the `initialize` function, when `make_current=True`, the code wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is opposite to the intended behavior. It should raise an error if it is not `None`, indicating that there is already a current instance.
- This issue leads to incorrect error messages being raised, causing the failing test to fail due to the wrongly placed error condition.

## Bug Fix Strategy
- We need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current=True` and then raise an error. 

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the function should behave as intended and pass the failing test case.
