### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the initialization of the IOLoop instance.
2. The bug occurs in the logic related to checking the current IOLoop instance and setting it as the current instance.
3. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the expectation is that when `make_current=True` is passed to `IOLoop`, it should set the current IOLoop instance. Subsequent calls to initialize with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug is in the conditional logic where checking for the current IOLoop instance is incorrect.

### Bug:
The bug arises when checking for the current IOLoop instance. The logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to make an IOLoop instance current.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`.
2. Check for the current IOLoop instance properly and raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be resolved, and the test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
