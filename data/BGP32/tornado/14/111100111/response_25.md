Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The logic inside the `initialize` function that checks whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The comparison of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `None` might not behave as expected.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. However, when `make_current` is `True`, the existing logic only raises an error if the current instance is `None`, which is the opposite of what is intended.

To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Correction of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the necessary corrections to the logic, the updated `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
