### Analyzing the buggy function

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current instance (if specified). The function checks whether the current instance of `IOLoop` exists and behaves accordingly based on the `make_current` parameter.

### Potential error locations
1. Incorrect condition checking for the existence of the current instance.
2. Incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition checking in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if the current instance is not `None` instead of creating a new current instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checking in the `initialize` function. Specifically, when `make_current` is `True`, we should only create a new current instance if the current instance is `None`. If the current instance already exists, we should not raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected version of the `initialize` function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Do not raise an error if current instance already exists
            pass
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition checking logic as shown above, the corrected `initialize` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test.
