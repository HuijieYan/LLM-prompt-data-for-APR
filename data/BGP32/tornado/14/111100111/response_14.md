The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the logic of checking for the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue arises when `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, but the code proceeds to raise a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

To fix this bug, I suggest modifying the conditional check within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, the code will now only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance is already present.

This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully. It aligns with the expected behavior of the function based on the input parameters and the logic described in the class documentation.
