The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class arises due to incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` parameter. The function is supposed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` even when it should not.

The issue lies in the logic flow where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop`, the function should set the current `IOLoop` using `self.make_current()`. However, the logic is flawed, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised inappropriately.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, preventing the unnecessary `RuntimeError` from being raised. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided above.
