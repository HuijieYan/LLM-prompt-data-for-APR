The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue lies in the condition checking logic when `make_current` is provided as an argument.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the `initialize` function where the condition for raising an error might not be working as intended.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The buggy function initializes an `IOLoop` instance, and it should either create a new current instance if none exists or raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True` but a current instance already exists.
- However, the issue occurs because the condition where the error is raised is incorrect. It incorrectly checks whether a current instance exists before raising the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The condition for checking whether a current instance already exists needs to be inverted. If `make_current` argument is `True`, it should first attempt to make the instance current without checking whether one exists. If the attempt fails because a current instance already exists, then the error should be raised.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        try:
            self.make_current()
        except RuntimeError:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

After applying this fix, the `initialize` function should correctly handle making the `IOLoop` instance current and raising an error if needed, thus passing the failing test case mentioned.
