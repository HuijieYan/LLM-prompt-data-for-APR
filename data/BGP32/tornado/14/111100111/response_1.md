### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and sets it as the current one if not already set.
2. The issue arises when `make_current=True` is provided as a parameter, and even though there is no current instance, it still raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug seems to be in the logic of checking for the current instance and handling the case when `make_current=True`.
4. The fix would involve adjusting the condition check when `make_current=True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current=True`. The current logic raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Fix Strategy:
Adjust the condition to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

Now, with this corrected version, the function should behave as expected and pass the failing test case mentioned.
