## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The `initialize` function checks the value of the `make_current` parameter and calls the `make_current` function accordingly. It also checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises an error if `make_current` is `True` in such a case.
3. The failing test is testing the behavior when `make_current` is set to `True`. The test expects the `initialize` function to create a new `IOLoop` instance as the current one since there is none currently.
4. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. In the buggy function, it checks if the current instance is `None`, but it should actually check if the current instance already exists and not raise an error in that case.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function exists because of incorrect logic in handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. The function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when it should instead simply set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. The logic should be modified to set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one in this case, instead of raising an error.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current()
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
