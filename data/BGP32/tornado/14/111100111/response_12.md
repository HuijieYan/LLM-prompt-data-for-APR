The buggy function `initialize` has conditional logic that aims to handle the case when `make_current` is `None`, and another case when `make_current` is `True`. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and it first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the "current IOLoop already exists".

The issue arises because in the case where `make_current` is `True`, the function should allow the existing current `IOLoop` instance to remain, rather than raising an error.

To fix the bug, we can simply remove the check for `None` when `make_current` is `True`. This will ensure that the existing `IOLoop` instance remains unchanged when a new `IOLoop` is initialized with `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

This correction will allow the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current=True` case correctly, ensuring that the existing `IOLoop` instance is not overwritten unnecessarily.
