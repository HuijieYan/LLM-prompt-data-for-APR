The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug related to checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue arises when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument. The buggy function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, but it should actually be checking if it is not `None` for the case where `make_current=True`.

The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function does not properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` is set. The function incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` to decide whether to raise an error, while it should be checking if the current instance is not `None`.

To fix the bug, the condition for `make_current=True` should be updated to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected test case.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if not None instead of None
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that when `make_current=True` is provided, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before deciding whether to raise an error. This updated logic aligns with the expected behavior in the failing test case.
