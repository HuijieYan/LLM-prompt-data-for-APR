### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and making it current based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue seems to be related to the condition check for the current `IOLoop` instance and the subsequent behavior based on the condition. 
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current=True` when initializing the `IOLoop` instance, expects to raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and confirms that `IOLoop.current()` returns the initialized `IOLoop`.
4. The bug seems to be in the condition check logic when `make_current` is provided as `True`. The function is not correctly handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the buggy function does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` properly when `make_current` is `True`. This leads to incorrect behavior regarding the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` when `make_current` is `True`. We should ensure that the `IOLoop` instance is only made current if it doesn't already exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition checks as shown above, we ensure that the `IOLoop` instance is correctly handled based on the presence or absence of the current instance, addressing the bug identified in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
