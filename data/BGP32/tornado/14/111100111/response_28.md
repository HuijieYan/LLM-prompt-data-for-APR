### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which determines if the current instance should be forcibly set.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance is already present.
3. The current implementation checks if the current instance is `None` before setting it as the current instance. This check is redundant and causes the error when trying to force the current instance even if one already exists.
4. To fix the bug, the conditional check for `None` should be removed, and we should directly set the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Remove the initial check in the `initialize` function that verifies if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. Directly set the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.
3. Update the code to raise an error only if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the bug causing the error when trying to force the current instance with `make_current=True` has been fixed by removing the unnecessary check for `None` and directly checking for the existence of the current instance before proceeding.
