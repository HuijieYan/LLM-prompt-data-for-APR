Based on the provided information, here is the analysis, error detection, explanation of the bug, and the corrected version of the buggy function:

### Analysis:
1. There are three functions within the `IOLoop` class: `current`, `make_current`, and `initialize`.
2. The `initialize` function initializes the `IOLoop` object by making it the current instance if necessary.
3. The `make_current` function is responsible for setting the current instance of the `IOLoop`.
4. The `current` function is used to retrieve the current instance of the `IOLoop`.

### Error Location:
1. In the `initialize` function, the bug occurs when checking the current instance of `IOLoop` for its existence or absence.
2. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to determine if the current instance does not exist.

### Bug Explanation:
1. When `make_current` is provided as `True`, the function checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None. If it is, it tries to raise an error "current IOLoop already exists" which is incorrect behavior.
2. The bug arises from the incorrect comparison logic that leads to raising an error when the current instance is indeed None.

### Bug Fixing Strategy:
1. To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to True.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated initialize function in IOLoop class
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be resolved and the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
