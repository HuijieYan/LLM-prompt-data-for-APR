## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug in this function arises from the logic to determine whether the current `IOLoop` exists or not before making it current.
3. The issue on GitHub questions the logic at line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for being None, and questions the subsequent raise of "already exists" error message.
4. The bug is due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be revised.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.
2. Check if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing before making a new one current.
3. Ensure that if `make_current` is set to `True`, the existing `IOLoop` instance is checked correctly to avoid the RuntimeError.
4. Implement the necessary changes in the function to pass the failing test case and satisfy the expected input/output values.

## Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing functions remain unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass successfully while adhering to the expected input/output criteria.
