## Correction:

The bug in the `initialize()` function lies in the condition `if make_current is None`. The `make_current` parameter should default to `False` instead of `None` for proper execution of the logic within the function.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=False):
        if not make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The default value for the `make_current` parameter is set to `False`.
- The conditions inside the function are adjusted accordingly to ensure the expected behavior.

Now the function should correctly handle the initialization logic based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
