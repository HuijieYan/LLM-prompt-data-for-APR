## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    @classmethod
    def current(cls, instance=True):
        # Update the body of this function as needed
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        # Update the body of this function as needed
        pass
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is not defined as a class method, which is causing the error.
2. Since `IOLoop.current` function is called without the correct context, it is necessary to define it as a class method using `@classmethod`.
3. The incorrect implementation of `IOLoop.current` can lead to it being called without the correct reference to the class instance, causing runtime errors.
4. By changing the `current` function to a class method, it ensures that the function is called within the correct context of the class.
5. The above corrected version of the function captures the necessary changes to fix the issue.
