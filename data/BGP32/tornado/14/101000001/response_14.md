The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the usage of the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class. The `current` function is defined as a class method, but it is being called as an instance method inside the `initialize` function.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `current` function is called in the `initialize` function. We should call the `current` function as a class method using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of trying to call it as an instance method using `self.current()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function should now correctly call the `current` function from the `IOLoop` class and resolve the bug.
