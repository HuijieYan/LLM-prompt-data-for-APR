## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

After analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the potential error locations can be identified. The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition `if make_current is None`. This condition does not correctly check for the absence of the `make_current` argument. 

To fix this bug, the condition needs to be modified to explicitly check if `make_current` is not provided as an argument. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the instance of the `IOLoop` class is correctly initialized before setting it as the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version explicitly checks for the absence of the `make_current` argument and ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is correctly initialized before making it the current instance.
