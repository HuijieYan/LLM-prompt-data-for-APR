    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(cls=False) is None:  # Fixed the calling of current method
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(cls=False) is None:  # Fixed the calling of current method

```

### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class had the issue in calling the `current` method. The correct way to call the `current` method within the same class is by using `self.current(cls=False)` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
2. The bug was causing the function to not correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, leading to errors in the logic flow.
3. The root cause of the bug was the incorrect way of calling the `current` method which caused the function to always miss existing `IOLoop` instances and prevent execution of the `make_current` method.
4. The bug was fixed by changing the calls to the `current` method within the `IOLoop` class to use `self.current(cls=False)` for accessing the method correctly within the class context.
