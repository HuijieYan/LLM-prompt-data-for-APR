## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

```

#### Explanation of the bug and solution:
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition check for `make_current`. The original code had `elif make_current` which would not check for `None` values properly. 
The correct approach is to check if `make_current` is `None` or `True` before proceeding with the logic to ensure that the `make_current` function is called only when necessary. 
Therefore, the corrected version now checks for `None` or `True` values of `make_current` and handles them accordingly.
