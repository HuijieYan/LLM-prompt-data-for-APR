The bug in the `initialize` function is due to the way the `current` method is being called within the `IOLoop` class. The `current` method is defined as a regular instance method within the class, but it is being called as a class method in the `initialize` function. This inconsistency is causing the bug.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that when calling the `current` method within the `initialize` function, it is properly called on an instance of the class `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using `self.current(instance=False)` instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, we are ensuring that the `current` method is called on the instance of the `IOLoop` class itself, fixing the bug and maintaining consistency within the class structure.
