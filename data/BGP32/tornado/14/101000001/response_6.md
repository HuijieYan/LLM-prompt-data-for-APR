## Corrected Version

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    
```

## Explanation
The bug in the original code lies in how the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function is called. It should be called from the instance of the `IOLoop` class (`self.current(instance=False)`) rather than directly from the class (`IOLoop.current(instance=False)`). 

Additionally, the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists should be `if self.current(instance=False) is not None` instead of `if self.current(instance=False) is None`.

## Fix Strategy
1. Update the calls to the `current` function within the `initialize` function to be called from the instance (`self.current(instance=False)`).
2. Update the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists to compare with `is not None`.
3. Retain the rest of the logic as it is.

By making the above changes, the bug in the `initialize` function can be fixed.
