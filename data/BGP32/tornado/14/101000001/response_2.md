## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by setting it as the current instance. However, there are issues with the logic in the `initialize` function that are causing it to behave incorrectly.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` in both the `if` and `elif` blocks could be causing the issue.
2. The logic of checking `make_current` parameter is redundant and can be simplified.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditions in the `initialize` function. The function is checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` before setting it as the current instance. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary `if make_current is None:` condition and keep the logic within the `else` block.
2. Simplify the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before setting it as the current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
