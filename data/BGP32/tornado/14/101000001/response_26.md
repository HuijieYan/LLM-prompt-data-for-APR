The bug in the function `initialize()` is that the `make_current` parameter is not being correctly handled, leading to a potential error scenario when `make_current` is provided as `True`. This bug arises from the incorrect condition checking in the `initialize()` function.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the condition checking for the `make_current` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize()` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` (using `make_current is True`). If it evaluates to true, we make sure that an exception is raised if the current IOLoop already exists, preventing any potential issues.

By making these changes, we ensure that the `initialize()` function handles the `make_current` parameter correctly and avoids the bug that could occur when `make_current` is provided as `True`.
