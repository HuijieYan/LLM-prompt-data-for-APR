## Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

## Explanation of the bug and strategy for fixing it

The bug in the original function lies in the condition check for whether the current `IOLoop` already exists. The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check within the `initialize` function. The intention of the original code was to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to accurately check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is called.

The bug can be fixed by changing the condition in the `elif` block from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`. This change will correctly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does while making the correct `IOLoop` instance current if not.
