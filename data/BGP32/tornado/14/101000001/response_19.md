## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Check for boolean True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```


## Explanation
The bug in the original code lies in the condition `elif make_current:` where it checks for the truthiness of `make_current`. The intended check should be `elif make_current is True:` to specifically check for the boolean `True` value. Additionally, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is also corrected to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` to check for the presence of an existing current IOLoop.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
- Replace the `elif make_current:` with `elif make_current is True:`
- Change the `is None` condition to `is not None` for existing current IOLoop check.

By following these corrections, the bug in the original function can be fixed.
