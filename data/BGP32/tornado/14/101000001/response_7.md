## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is attempting to check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance using the `current` function. However, the way the `current` function is called is incorrect, leading to the bug. The `current` function is an instance method of the `IOLoop` class but is being accessed as a class method, which is causing the bug.

## Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` calls within the `initialize` function.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug is caused by incorrectly calling the `current` method as a class method instead of an instance method. This causes the function to not behave as expected and leads to incorrect checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly call the `current` method as an instance method within the `IOLoop` class.

## Corrected Version of the Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(self, instance=True):
        # Corrected method declaration
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Corrected method invocation
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Corrected method invocation
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the method invocation `self.current()` within the `initialize` function, the bug is fixed by using the correct instance method approach. This ensures that the function correctly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and behaves as intended.
