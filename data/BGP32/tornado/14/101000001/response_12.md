## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
1. The buggy function `initialize` was not properly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance existed before calling `self.make_current()`.
2. The bug was located within the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function where the logic for handling `make_current` parameter was incorrect.
3. The bug was causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even if the current `IOLoop` instance was not present when `make_current` was called. Furthermore, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance was reversed.
4. To fix the bug, the logic inside the `elif` statement was corrected to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`.
5. The corrected version of the function has been provided above.
