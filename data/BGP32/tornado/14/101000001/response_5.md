The bug in the provided function `initialize()` is in the logic for checking if the current IOLoop instance exists. The bug occurs when `make_current` is not None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, where it should raise a RuntimeError but does not do so.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for raising the RuntimeError. The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: # Changed condition to check if instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for raising RuntimeError has been changed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, then raise the error. This change ensures that the bug is fixed and the function works as intended.
