## Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Analysis:
- The bug in the original function `initialize` is in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` as it is checking for current IOLoop instance incorrectly.
- The corrected version of the condition should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` to properly check if an instance already exists.
- The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the situation where an IOLoop instance already exists, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Fix strategy:
- Change the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly check if an IOLoop instance exists rather than checking if it doesn't exist.
- Update the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` in the `initialize` function to address the bug.
