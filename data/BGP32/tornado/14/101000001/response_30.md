## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is a current instance of the `IOLoop` class through the `current` function and then attempts to make the current `IOLoop` instance using `make_current` function. However, there is an issue with the logic flow that checks for the current instance and the `make_current` function call.

## Identified bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is with the logic flow inside the `if` statement. If the `make_current` parameter is provided and evaluates to True, it does not properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before calling `make_current`. This can lead to the `RuntimeError` not being raised when it should.

## Cause of the bug:
The `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is provided as True. It directly calls `self.make_current()` without checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Bug fixing strategy:
1. Update the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before calling `make_current` when `make_current` parameter is provided and evaluates to True.
2. Check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before making the current instance.

## Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function first checks if the `make_current` parameter is provided and evaluates to True. It then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before calling `self.make_current()`. This ensures that the correct logic flow is followed and avoids potential issues with the current instance.
