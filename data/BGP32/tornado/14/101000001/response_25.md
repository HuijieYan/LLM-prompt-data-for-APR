## Correction:

The bug in the `initialize` function stems from the usage of the `current` method without proper instantiation of the class `IOLoop` to access it. The `current` method is an instance method, but it is being called as a class method in the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, we need to instantiate an object of the `IOLoop` class and then call the `current` method on that object. Additionally, we need to update the `make_current` method calls to `self.make_current()` to properly invoke the method within the class instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    ioloop_instance = IOLoop()
    if make_current is None:
        if ioloop_instance.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if ioloop_instance.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By instantiating an object of the `IOLoop` class and then calling the instance methods `current` and `make_current` correctly through that object, we ensure that the function operates as intended without the bug.
