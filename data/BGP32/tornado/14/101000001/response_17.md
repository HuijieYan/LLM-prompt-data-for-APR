The bug in the provided function `initialize` is the way the `IOLoop.current` function is called. In the buggy function, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` should actually be `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` as per the definition of the `current` function within the `IOLoop` class.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to correctly call the `IOLoop.current` function with `instance=True` parameter. Here is the corrected version:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the change to call `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the correct behavior is captured and the bug is fixed.
