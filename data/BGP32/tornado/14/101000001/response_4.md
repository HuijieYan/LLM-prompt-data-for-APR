## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
        
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Fixed to use self.current instead of IOLoop.current
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed the condition to check for existing IOLoop
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

## Analysis:
1. The buggy function "initialize" in the IOLoop class is meant to initialize the IOLoop object by setting it as the current IOLoop if no IOLoop instance exists.
2. The buggy function calls the "current" method of the same class IOLoop to check if an instance of IOLoop already exists.
3. The bug in the original code was that the function "IOLoop.current(instance=False)" was being called directly instead of using "self.current(instance=False)", causing the check for an existing IOLoop instance to fail.
4. The bug was fixed by replacing the incorrect calls to "IOLoop.current" with the correct calls to "self.current" within the "initialize" function.
5. The corrected version accurately checks for an existing IOLoop instance before either creating a new one or raising an error.
