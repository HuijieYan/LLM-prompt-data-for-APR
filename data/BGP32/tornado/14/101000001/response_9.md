## Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` object.
- The function checks if `make_current` is provided, and if not, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it calls the `make_current` function.
- If `make_current` is provided and evaluates to True, the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it calls the `make_current` function.

## Issues:
- The main issue in the buggy function is with how the `current` and `make_current` functions within the `IOLoop` class are accessed.
- The `current` function should be accessed using the `self` keyword to reference the instance, but in the buggy function, it is called using the class name `IOLoop`, which is incorrect.
- Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be revised to ensure appropriate handling.

## Solution:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(self, instance=True):
        # Implementation of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Implementation of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

## Corrections Made:
- Corrected the calls to `current` within the `initialize` function to use `self` to reference the instance of the class.
- Updated the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance existence to ensure proper handling.
