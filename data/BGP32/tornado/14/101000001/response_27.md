## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` had a logical error in the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
- The function was not properly checking whether the `make_current` flag was True or False. It was not handling the case when `make_current` is False.
- The comparison `elif make_current:` was incorrect as it only checks if make_current is True. It does not cover the case when make_current is False.
- The bug caused the function to incorrectly raise an error even when the current `IOLoop` existed.
- The corrected version addresses these issues by properly handling both cases of `make_current`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the condition in the `initialize` function to properly check if the `make_current` flag is False or not explicitly provided.
- Adjust the logic to correctly handle both cases of `make_current` to ensure the correct behavior of the function.
- Include appropriate error handling to cover all scenarios and avoid raising errors when unnecessary.
