The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical error in the conditional statement that checks whether `make_current` is `None`. The issue arises from the internal function calls and the logic used to determine the behavior of the function.

1. Analysis:
   - The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by calling the `make_current` method if needed.
   - The `current` method is used to get the current `IOLoop` instance, and `make_current` method sets the current instance.

2. Potential Error Locations:
   - The conditional statement checking if `make_current` is `None` lacks clarity and correct logic.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the different conditions when `make_current` is `None` or it's not `None`.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Revise the conditional statements to handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or not `None` explicitly.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if self.current(instance=False) is None:  # Update to self.current() instead of IOLoop.current()
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Update the condition for raising error
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` or not. If it is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already set and calls `make_current` if needed. If `make_current` is not `None`, it verifies if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before setting the current one.
