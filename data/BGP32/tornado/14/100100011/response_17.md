The issue in the `initialize` function is that the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance exists is incorrect. The bug causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when the current IOLoop instance is None.

The correct approach is to first check if `make_current` is provided, and if so, directly initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance. Then, if make_current is None, check if an IOLoop instance already exists and only create a new one if it doesn't.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the logic checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance properly and only raises a RuntimeError when trying to create a new one if an instance already exists.

This correction should fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue and also make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
