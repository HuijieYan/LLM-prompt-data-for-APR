## Analysis:
The issue is related to the `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file of the `tornado` library. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` parameter is True.

## Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the handling of the `make_current` parameter. The current implementation checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, and if so, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If not, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current` is not None, it checks if a current instance already exists and if so raises a RuntimeError, but it should not be raising the error here if `make_current` is True, as it should be allowed to create a new current instance.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because of incorrect handling of `make_current` parameter conditions. The logic should allow creating a new current instance when `make_current` is True, but currently, it is raising an error in this case.

## Suggested Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to allow creating a new current instance when `make_current` is True. We should only raise an error when there is already a current instance and `make_current` is True.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the test case `test_force_current` should pass without raising a RuntimeError.
