The bug in the provided `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument. The function should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop already exists when `make_current=True`. However, in the current implementation, it does not check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current()`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one when `make_current=True`. If an instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if an instance of IOLoop already exists before creating a new one, the corrected version of the function will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` if one already exists.

This correction should resolve the GitHub issue related to line 252 in `ioloop.py` where the behavior of checking for an existing IOLoop instance is being questioned. After applying this correction, the failing test case should also pass as the bug has been fixed.
