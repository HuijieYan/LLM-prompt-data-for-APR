### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and should be made current or already exists. If it exists and `make_current` is provided, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is testing the behavior when trying to force the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The GitHub issue highlights confusion regarding the behavior at `line 252` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked if it is `None`.
4. The bug seems to be in the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and handling of `make_current`.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle situations where the `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is provided.
2. Ensure that the `initialize` function sets the current `IOLoop` instance based on the conditions provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected initialize function in ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, it ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is set as expected based on the provided conditions. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
