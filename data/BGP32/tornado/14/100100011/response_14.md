The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic used to determine whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when it is not needed. 

The root cause of the issue is as follows:
- The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method.
- If `make_current` is not `None`, and it is True, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The problem arises when the function is called with `make_current=True` even when there is no current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, it mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug:
- Check if `make_current` is `True` before checking for the current `IOLoop` instance.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, call the `make_current` method.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, raise a `RuntimeError`.
- Modify the logic to first check if `make_current=True` and then proceed accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test provided in the question.
