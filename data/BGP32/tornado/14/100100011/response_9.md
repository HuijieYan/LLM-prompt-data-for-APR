# The issue in the buggy function:
The issue in the initialize() function lies in the logic that checks whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not. The bug occurs when the make_current parameter is set to True and the current IOLoop instance already exists. In this case, the function should raise a RuntimeError, but due to the incorrect condition checking, it is not behaving as expected.

# The cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the if-elif structure in the initialize() function does not handle the case where make_current is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists properly. This leads to the RuntimeError not being raised when it should be, causing the failing test case.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function correctly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. We should modify the logic to first check if make_current is True and if the current instance already exists, then raise a RuntimeError. Additionally, the condition for make_current being None should also be clarified to avoid any confusion.

# Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the initialize() function with the corrected logic as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should behave as expected according to the failing test case.
