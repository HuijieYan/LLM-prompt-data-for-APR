### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance.
2. The `initialize` function accepts an optional `make_current` argument which determines whether the new IOLoop instance should be set as the current instance.
3. The bug seems to be related to the logic around checking if a current IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` twice and expects the second attempt to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug stems from the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it's not. This is contradictory to the intended behavior.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` exposes this issue by attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, leading to the incorrect logic being triggered and the `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where a current IOLoop instance already exists.
2. Adjust the condition checks to ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary, i.e., when attempting to make the current IOLoop instance when it already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, it should now correctly handle the scenario of existing IOLoop instances and pass the failing test mentioned (`test_force_current`).
