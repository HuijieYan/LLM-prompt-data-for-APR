### Analysis:
The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance and ensure that there is only one current `IOLoop` instance active. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and the `IOLoop` instance already exists, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

### Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, the `RuntimeError` is raised.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is the source of the incorrect logic. The intention was to check if an `IOLoop` instance does not exist, but the current implementation checks if it does not exist.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly checks if an `IOLoop` instance does not exist and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. This is not the expected behavior as it should only raise an error when an `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and only raise a `RuntimeError` if it does and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current `IOLoop` instance in a variable `current_instance`. Then, we adjust the conditions to correctly check if a current instance exists and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an instance is already active. This change should make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test.
