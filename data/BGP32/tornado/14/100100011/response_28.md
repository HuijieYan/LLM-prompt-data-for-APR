The bug in the `initialize` function is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail, as reported in the GitHub issue "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None." The issue seems to be related to the logic in the `initialize` function where the "current IOLoop already exists" RuntimeError is raised even when IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None.

The cause of the bug is in the logic flow of the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, and if it is None, it raises the RuntimeError. However, in the test scenario provided, the expectation seems to be that the RuntimeError should only be raised if there is already an existing current IOLoop, not when it is None.

To fix this bug, we can change the logic within the `initialize` function. We should only raise the RuntimeError when `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, indicating that a current IOLoop instance already exists. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub "ioloop.py(line 252) is None or not None."
