## Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is meant to initialize the IOLoop object. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, causing the function to incorrectly check if the current IOLoop instance exists. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when the current IOLoop instance does not exist.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing IOLoop instance and `make_current` is set to `True`. If `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, the error should be handled differently.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function in tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # raise error only if an IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

After applying this fix, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`, resolving the issue described in the GitHub post. The corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.
