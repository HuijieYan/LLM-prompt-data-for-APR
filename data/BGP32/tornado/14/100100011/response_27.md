### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance.
2. The issue reported on GitHub points out a discrepancy between checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and then raising an error saying it already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to ensure that trying to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug seems to be in the logic around checking the current IOLoop instance and raising an error.

### Bugs:
1. The bug lies in the condition checking where if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is true, it should proceed with `self.make_current()`, but then immediately after, it checks for the same condition and raises an error if it's still `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. We need to ensure that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, we proceed with setting the current IOLoop instance and not raise an error immediately after.
2. The error should only be raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version ensures that if the current IOLoop instance is not set, it will set it, and if `make_current=True` is specified, it will only raise an error if the current instance already exists. This should address the reported bug and make the failing test pass.
