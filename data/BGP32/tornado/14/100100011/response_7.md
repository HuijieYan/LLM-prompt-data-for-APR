### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing an `IOLoop` object with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The failing test in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` checks if creating a new `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` will raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The issue raised in GitHub questions the logic in `line 252` of `ioloop.py` where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and then raises an error.
4. The bug occurs when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, causing the function to raise an error even if `make_current` is set to `True`.
5. To fix the bug, the logic should be modified to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the error is only raised when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This change aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
