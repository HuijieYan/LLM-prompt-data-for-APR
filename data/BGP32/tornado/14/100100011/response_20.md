Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked twice without any clear separation between the two cases.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter seems unclear and may lead to error conditions.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the ambiguous handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. In the failing test, when `make_current=True` is passed to create two instances of `IOLoop`, the second instance should raise a `RuntimeError` because an `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, the condition checking for an existing `current` instance and raising the error is not executed correctly in the buggy function.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Streamline the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Clearly differentiate between the case where an `IOLoop` exists and where it doesn't to avoid confusion and potential errors.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
# Fix the buggy function here
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if current_instance is None:
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

By updating the logic in the corrected function, the conditions are checked in a clear and concise manner. This version checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and based on the `make_current` parameter, determines whether to create a new instance or raise an error if one already exists.
