### Analysis:
1. The `initialize()` function in the `ioloop.py` file is checking if an IOLoop instance already exists and, if not, creating a new one. If `make_current` argument is set to `True`, it should make the current IOLoop instance, but the handling of this logic seems to have a bug.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` indicates that creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The bug appears to be in the conditional logic within the `initialize()` function, where it incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before deciding whether to make the current instance or raise an error.
4. To fix this bug, the `initialize()` function needs to correctly handle the `make_current` argument and check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before taking any action. If `make_current=True` and the current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize()` function is provided below:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one or raise an error, this corrected version of the function should address the bug and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
