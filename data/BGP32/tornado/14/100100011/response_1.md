The issue in the buggy function `initialize()` lies in the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The bug occurs when attempting to force the creation of a new current IOLoop instance using `make_current=True` while one already exists.

In the failing test `test_force_current`, the intention is to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then ensure that a RuntimeError is raised when attempting to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.
2. If `make_current=True` is specified and a current instance exists, raise a RuntimeError.
3. If `make_current=None`, check if a current instance exists and if not, create a new current instance.
4. If no condition is met, do not make any changes to the existing current instance.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the corrections, the updated `initialize()` function should properly handle the creation of new IOLoop instances based on the `make_current` parameter and correctly raise a RuntimeError when necessary. This should align with the expected behavior in the failing test `test_force_current` and address the issue raised on GitHub.
