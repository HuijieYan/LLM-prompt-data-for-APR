The issue in the `initialize` function is that it is incorrectly checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` twice in different branches of the `if-elif` statement. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when it shouldn't be.

To fix this issue, we can revise the `initialize` function to only check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance once, and then either make it current or raise an error accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking and storing the current `IOLoop` instance before applying any actions, we ensure consistency and avoid the issue of raising an error when it is not needed. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided and resolve the GitHub issue raised.
