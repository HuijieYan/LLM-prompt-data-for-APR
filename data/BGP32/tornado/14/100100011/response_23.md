The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class from `tornado/ioloop.py` file. This method is used for initializing an IOLoop instance and setting it as the current IOLoop.

The potential error locations in the `initialize` method are:
1. In the `if` branch where `make_current` is `None`, the condition checks if the current IOLoop is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`.
2. In the `elif` branch where `make_current` is `True`, the condition checks if the current IOLoop is `None`, and raises a `RuntimeError` if it's not `None`. If it is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`.

The bug in the function is that in the `if` branch, when `make_current` is `None`, the `self.make_current()` method is called even if the current IOLoop exists. This contradicts the intention of only making the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `make_current` is `None` and if the current IOLoop is already set before calling `self.make_current()`. Additionally, the logic for handling `make_current=True` also needs to be adjusted to ensure consistency.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding a proper check to ensure that `self.make_current()` is only called when necessary, we fix the bug in the `initialize` method. This corrected version should pass the failing test case `test_force_current` and address the issue reported on GitHub.
