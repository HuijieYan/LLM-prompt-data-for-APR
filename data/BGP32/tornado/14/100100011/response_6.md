### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file is designed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, particularly with regards to setting the current instance. 
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` aims to ensure that creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
3. The bug occurs due to the condition checking logic in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is True, it should check if a current instance already exists, and if yes, raise an error. However, the current logic is checking the opposite condition.
4. To fix the bug, the condition checking for the existence of the current instance needs to be adjusted so that the `RuntimeError` is raised when a current instance exists and `make_current` is True.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Adjusted condition
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition in the `initialize` function, it will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is set to True. This fix aligns with the expected behavior as per the failing test and resolves the issue mentioned on GitHub.
