### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in `ioloop.py` is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not and then optionally make it the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The test function `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` is testing the behavior when trying to construct a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- The GitHub issue points out a confusion regarding why the `RuntimeError` is raised even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

### Error Location:
- The error seems to be in the logic of the `initialize` function where the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not accurately handling the case when an instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `initialize` function checks for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance incorrectly. It should check if an instance already exists before deciding to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The fix should involve changing the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when an `IOLoop` instance already exists. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance is already present and `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the logic to store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable before the check, we ensure that the correct behavior is exhibited. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
