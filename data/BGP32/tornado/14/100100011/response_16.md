The issue with the `initialize` function is that it wrongly tries to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None in both conditions. The intention seems to be to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make the current IOLoop. However, the condition is incorrect since it allows both paths to execute even when an IOLoop instance exists.

To fix this bug, we need to change the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when an IOLoop instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, we can now properly prevent the creation of a new IOLoop instance in that case.

This corrected version should resolve the failing test case mentioned in the GitHub issue and ensure that a new IOLoop instance is only made current if one does not already exist.
