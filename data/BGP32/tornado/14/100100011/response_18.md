### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `ioloop.py` file is responsible for initializing the IOLoop.
2. The function checks if a current IOLoop instance exists and whether to make the current loop.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file attempts to create multiple IOLoop instances with the same current flag as `True`.
4. The GitHub issue questions the logic inconsistency at line 252 where the current IOLoop instance is checked but a RuntimeError is raised if None.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect logic in checking for the current IOLoop instance.
2. Inconsistent handling of the `make_current` flag.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the unexpected behavior of the `initialize()` function when checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError when the current instance is None, leading to the failure of the test `test_force_current`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `initialize()` function to handle the `make_current` flag properly.
2. Ensure that the function checks the current instance correctly before making it current or raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:  # No specific action required
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:  # Need to make current
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize()` function with the corrected logic as shown above, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should ensure that the IOLoop instances are handled properly based on the `make_current` flag, allowing the test `test_force_current` to pass successfully.
