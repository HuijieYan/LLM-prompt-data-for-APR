Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The logic inside the `initialize` function where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None twice: once before `self.make_current()` is called, and once after. This check is unnecessary and causes the RuntimeError to be raised when it shouldn't be.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to remove the redundant check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being None and adjust the logic to prevent the RuntimeError from being raised inappropriately.

## Corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the function to the corrected version above, the redundant check is removed, and the RuntimeError will only be raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is True. This change should resolve the bug and make the test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
