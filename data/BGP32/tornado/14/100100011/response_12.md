The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This leads to an incorrect RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't be.

The issue from GitHub highlights this problem by pointing out that the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, so the check for existing `IOLoop` should be based on this condition.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance is already present and behave as expected. The provided failing test for the `test_force_current` should now pass without raising a RuntimeError.
