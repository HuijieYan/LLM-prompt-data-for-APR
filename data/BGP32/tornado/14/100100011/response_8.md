After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test provided, it seems that the issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file.

The `initialize` function is checking if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, then it calls the `make_current` method. However, in the failing test `test_force_current`, the `make_current=True` is passed to the constructor, which should check if the IOLoop instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

The bug seems to be in how the `initialize` function handles the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. It incorrectly allows the creation of another IOLoop instance in this scenario, which is not the expected behavior as reflected in the failing test.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an existing IOLoop instance is present.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if `current_instance` is not `None` when `make_current=True`, the corrected version ensures that a `RuntimeError` is raised if an existing IOLoop instance is already present. This correction should make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test provided.
