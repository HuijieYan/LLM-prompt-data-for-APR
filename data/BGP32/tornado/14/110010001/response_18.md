### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the module `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The error message indicates that the function is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it fails because there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug occurs when the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if `make_current=True` and an instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` differently.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the condition where an error is raised if `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The intention seems to be that if `make_current=True`, the new `IOLoop` instance should try to become current and raise an error only if there is already a current instance. However, the current implementation raises an error if there is any current instance, regardless of whether it is the same instance as the current one.

### Fix:
Modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and the new `IOLoop` instance is trying to become the current one, but there is already a different current instance. If the new instance is the same as the current one, it should continue.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop and current_ioloop is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
