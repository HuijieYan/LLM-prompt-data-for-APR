1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class. This method is responsible for initializing an instance of the `IOLoop` class and making it the current `IOLoop` if specified.

2. There are potential error locations in the code where the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and determining whether to make the new `IOLoop` current or not might be incorrect.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, the function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then raising a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, this logic is incorrect because in this case, the intention is to force the new `IOLoop` instance to be the current one, regardless of whether there is an existing instance.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to not check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True`. Instead, we should directly make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By simplifying the logic in the `elif` block and directly calling `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the new `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one without checking for the existence of another current instance.
