1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method inside the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module. This class is used for managing an I/O loop in Tornado. The `initialize` method is meant to initialize the IOLoop object. The error message indicates that a RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional statement that checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If `make_current` is True and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance, then a RuntimeError is raised.

3. The bug occurs because the code is checking if a current IOLoop instance exists before actually setting the current IOLoop instance. This results in the situation where the check fails even though there is no existing current IOLoop instance set.

4. To fix this bug, we should first set the current IOLoop instance before checking if it exists. This way, the check will accurately determine whether a current instance is already set or not.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()  # set the current IOLoop instance first
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By setting the current IOLoop instance first before checking its existence, we ensure that the check accurately reflects the current state. This corrected version should prevent the RuntimeError from occurring.
