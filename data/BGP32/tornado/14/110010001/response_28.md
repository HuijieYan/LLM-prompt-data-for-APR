### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the class `IOLoop`. It checks if the argument `make_current` is `None` or `True` and performs certain actions based on that. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and makes the current `IOLoop` if it's not present. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if it's already present.
  
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the method tries to check for the current `IOLoop` instance without considering the given argument `instance=False`. This leads to the error message that a current `IOLoop` already exists when it should not.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not considering the `instance=False` argument when checking for the current `IOLoop` instance. This causes the method to incorrectly detect the current instance even when it's not supposed to do so based on the given argument.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the method checks for the current `IOLoop` instance without considering it as the current instance. This can be done by passing `instance=False` to the `IOLoop.current()` method when checking for the current instance.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the corrected version of the function ensures that it correctly handles the `make_current` argument and properly checks for the current `IOLoop` instance based on the given argument.
