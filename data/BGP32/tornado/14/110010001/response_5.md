1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the class `IOLoop`:
   - The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class, responsible for initializing an `IOLoop` instance.
   - The `initialize` function takes an optional argument `make_current`, which determines whether the new `IOLoop` instance should become the current one.
   - The error message suggests that when `make_current=True`, there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to a `RuntimeError`.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The logic inside the `initialize` function to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance and decide whether to make the new instance current seems to have a bug.

3. Cause of the bug using the buggy function, class docs, and error message:
   - The error message explicitly states that a `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   - The cause of the bug lies in the conditional check for `make_current`, where it inadvertently checks if a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist and then attempts to make the new one current.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - To fix the bug, the logic should be reversed.
   - When `make_current=True`, it should be checked if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if it does, raise a `RuntimeError`.
   - If `make_current=None`, the logic should ensure that the new instance becomes current only if no current instance already exists.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
```

By reversing the logic in the `initialize` function to first check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, we prevent the RuntimeError from occurring as intended.
