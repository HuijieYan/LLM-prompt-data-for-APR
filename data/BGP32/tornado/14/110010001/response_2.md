1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the IOLoop class:
The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. It takes an optional argument `make_current` which determines whether the new IOLoop instance should become the current IOLoop.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The error seems to occur when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, and there is already a current IOLoop instance present.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because when `make_current=True`, the function checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If there is one, it raises a `RuntimeError`, but due to a logical error in the condition checking, it should not raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition check for when `make_current=True`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance, we should just return from the function, as there is no need to make the new instance current.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment in the condition check for `make_current=True`, the fixed function will not raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop instance already exists. This modification ensures that the new IOLoop instance is not unnecessarily made current when it is not needed.
