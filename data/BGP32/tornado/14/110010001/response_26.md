1. Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
- The error message shows that the issue arises when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and the error `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is raised.
  
2. Error location:
The error is occurring within the `initialize` method when checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` method where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

4. Strategy for fixing:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` method to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should just make the current instance the active one.

5. Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            # Make the current instance active
            current_ioloop.make_current()
        else:
            # No current instance, set this one as current
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_ioloop is None:
        # None specified and no current instance, set this one as current
        self.make_current()
```
