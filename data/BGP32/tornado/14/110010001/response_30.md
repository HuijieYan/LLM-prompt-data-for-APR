### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The error message is indicating that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current=True`.
3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, the function is checking if the current `IOLoop` does not exist, and then attempting to make the `IOLoop` current. However, the logic is incorrect because it should check if the current `IOLoop` already exists in that case. This is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic such that if `make_current=True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, it should then raise the `RuntimeError`.
5. The corrected version of the code is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.
