1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. This function is used to set up the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`. 

2. The potential error location in the `initialize` function is within the `if make_current` block where it is trying to check if a current IOLoop instance exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic to check for a current IOLoop instance is inverted. The buggy function is checking if a current IOLoop does not exist instead of checking if it does exist when `make_current` is set to `True`. This leads to the incorrect error being raised when a current IOLoop actually exists.

4. To fix the bug, we should change the logic within the `initialize` function to check if a current IOLoop instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. If it exists, do not raise an error, otherwise, set the IOLoop instance as the current one.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

This correction changes the condition in the `elif make_current` block to check if a current IOLoop instance exists and return instead of raising an error if it does.
