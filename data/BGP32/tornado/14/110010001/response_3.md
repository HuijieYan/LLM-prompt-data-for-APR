### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting up the IOLoop instance. It checks if a current instance exists and makes the new instance current if `make_current` is `True`.
   
2. The error message indicates that the code is trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, but there is already a current IOLoop instance present.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` even though there is already a current IOLoop instance present. This violates the logic in the `initialize` method that checks for the existence of the current IOLoop before making the new instance current.

### Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case when a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current=True`. We need to remove the check for the presence of a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True` and just directly make the new instance current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By directly making the new instance current when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the new instance will always become the current IOLoop instance, disregarding any existing current IOLoop instances.
