1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the class `IOLoop` from the `tornado.ioloop` module. It is responsible for setting up the IOLoop, which is essential for asynchronous event handling in Tornado. The purpose of the `initialize` method is to ensure that the current IOLoop instance is correctly set and handle the `make_current` argument appropriately.

2. The potential error in the `initialize` method lies in the conditional check for the value of `make_current`. The problematic part is the condition `elif make_current:` which should be checking if `make_current` is `True` rather than checking if it exists. This leads to the current IOLoop instance not being set correctly, resulting in the RuntimeError being raised.

3. The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is passed as `True`, the intended behavior is to raise a RuntimeError if a current IOLoop instance already exists. However, the buggy code does not handle this case correctly, leading to the error message "current IOLoop already exists."

4. To fix the bug, the conditional check for `make_current` should be modified to check if it is `True` rather than just checking if it exists. This ensures that the logic inside the `elif` block is only executed when `make_current` is explicitly `True`.

5. Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Corrected the conditional check
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if a current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` method should now handle the `make_current` argument properly and set the current IOLoop instance accordingly.
