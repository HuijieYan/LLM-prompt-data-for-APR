1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. It is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. 

2. The potential error location is within the `initialize` function, specifically in the condition where `make_current` is `True`. 

3. The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If an instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This error indicates that the function is trying to create a new current IOLoop instance when one already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to only try to make the IOLoop current if `make_current` is `True` and there is not already a current instance. If `make_current` is `False`, it should create a new instance without making it the current IOLoop.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that a new current IOLoop instance is only created if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance already. If a current instance exists and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.
