1. Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. This function is responsible for initializing an IOLoop instance and making it the current IOLoop if `make_current=True`. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance present, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

2. Potential Error Locations:
The bug is likely in the logic that checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists and then decides whether to make the new IOLoop instance the current one.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is due to the misplaced `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` check inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the code first checks if there is no current IOLoop instance before raising an error. This leads to the `RuntimeError` when a current IOLoop instance already exists.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the check for an existing current IOLoop instance should be done in reverse order. If `make_current=True`, the code should first check if there is a current IOLoop instance and proceed accordingly. This way, if a current IOLoop instance exists, it should raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

5. Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By reversing the order of the `is None` check to `is not None` when `make_current=True`, the bug is fixed. The corrected version should now pass the failing test.
