## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize an instance of `IOLoop` and make it the current `IOLoop` if `make_current=True`.
2. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function tries to make the current `IOLoop` without checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it is trying to set the current `IOLoop` when one already exists.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the `initialize` function not properly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the initializing instance the current one.

## Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to only make the initializing instance the current `IOLoop` if there is no current instance. If `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, it should raise an error.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this modification, the corrected `initialize` function will only set the initializing instance as the current `IOLoop` if there is no current instance when `make_current=True`. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
