1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop.py` file. The function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is not provided, or raises an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

2. The potential error location is in the conditional statements inside the `initialize` method.

3. The error message indicates a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This means that when the `initialize` method is called with `make_current=True`, it is trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance even though one already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists before trying to make the current `IOLoop`, we can avoid raising the `RuntimeError` as shown in the failing test.
