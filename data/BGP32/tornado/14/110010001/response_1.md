## Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which, if set to `True`, should ensure that the `IOLoop` instance becomes the current `IOLoop`.
- The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This error suggests that the function is incorrectly detecting the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance when it should not.
- The actual error occurs when the code is trying to switch the current `IOLoop` to the new instance, even though there might not be any existing current instance.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the logic for making the current `IOLoop`. When `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly checks if a current instance exists, and if it does, it raises an error. This check is unnecessary and causes the function to fail.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic when `make_current=True`. Instead of checking if a current instance exists and raising an error, we should directly make the instance the current `IOLoop`.

## Updated Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

With this update, we directly set the instance as the current `IOLoop` when `make_current=True`, and also handle the case when `make_current=None` and there is no existing current instance correctly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
