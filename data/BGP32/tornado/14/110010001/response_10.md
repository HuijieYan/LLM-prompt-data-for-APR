1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the `IOLoop` class, we can see that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If the `make_current` argument is True, it checks if a current `IOLoop` already exists. If so, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is incorrectly checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before making itself the current instance. In the failing test, the `make_current` argument is set to True, and since a current `IOLoop` instance was already present, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though it should try to become the current instance if `make_current` is True.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to only check if a current instance exists when `make_current` is False, and always make itself the current instance when `make_current` is True.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `IOLoop` instance will always try to become the current instance if `make_current` is True, regardless of whether a current instance already exists.
