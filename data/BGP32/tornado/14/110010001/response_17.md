### Analysis:
- The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize an instance of the class with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`.
- The error message indicates that the code is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing.

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue lies in the condition where `make_current=True`. It checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if one does. This condition is incorrectly handling the scenario where there is already a current instance.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the scenario when `make_current=True`. It should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and only then try to make the new instance current. If there is already a current instance, it should not raise an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when `make_current=True` to correctly handle the scenario where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The code should only try to make the new instance current if there isn't a current instance already present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if there is already a current IOLoop instance
            return  # If there is, do not raise an error
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new instance current, we prevent the RuntimeError from being raised in case a current instance already exists. This should fix the bug and allow the corrected version to pass the failing test.
