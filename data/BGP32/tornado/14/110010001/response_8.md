1. Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module.
- The purpose of this method is to initialize an instance of the `IOLoop` class.
- The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised.

2. Potential error locations:
- The issue seems to be related to the check for an existing current IOLoop instance.

3. Cause of the bug:
- The issue arises from how the `initialize` method handles the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is True and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a RuntimeError. The error message indicates that the issue occurs at line 253 of `tornado/ioloop.py`.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we should modify the logic within the `initialize` method to handle the `make_current` parameter more accurately. If `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, we should not raise an error or attempt to create a new current instance.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected version, we check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is True, and only create a new current instance if none exists. This modification should prevent the RuntimeError caused by trying to create a duplicate current `IOLoop` instance.
