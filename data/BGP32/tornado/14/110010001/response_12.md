1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class within the `tornado.ioloop` module.
   - The `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
   - The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

2. Potential Error Location:
   - The error seems to be occurring in the `initialize` function when it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and then raises an error based on the condition.

3. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug occurs due to a discrepancy between the condition checking for an existing `IOLoop` instance and the subsequent action taken when `make_current` is `True`. The function should not raise an error when `make_current` is `True` but should instead update the existing `IOLoop` instance as the current one.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
   - Instead of raising an error if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, the function should simply update the existing instance to be the current one.
   - To achieve this modification, we can remove the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` check for `make_current=True` as it is unnecessary.

5. Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        # Check if make_current parameter is explicitly passed
        if make_current is None:
            # If make_current is not specified, make this IOLoop instance current
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            # If make_current is explicitly passed
            if make_current:
                # If make_current is True, update the current instance
                self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the existing `IOLoop` instance becomes the current one when `make_current` is `True`, without raising a `RuntimeError` in case an instance already exists.
