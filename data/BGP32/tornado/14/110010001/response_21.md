### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing a new IOLoop instance, and it takes an optional argument `make_current`.
- The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is `True`, it should only make the new IOLoop instance the current one if there is no current instance already.
- The bug occurs when the function tries to make the IOLoop instance current without checking if there is already a current instance existing.

### Potential Bug Location:
- The issue lies in the block of code where `make_current` is `True`, and it tries to set the instance as the current one without checking the existence of a current instance.

### Bug Explanation:
- The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function should first check if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If there is one, it should not raise an error but should exit gracefully without overriding the existing current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Before setting the new IOLoop instance as the current one when `make_current` is `True, we should first check if there is already a current instance. If there is, we should simply return instead of raising an error.
- This way, we ensure that we don't override an existing current IOLoop instance unnecessarily.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the corrected class with the fix to the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
        import errno
        import functools
        import tornado.ioloop
        import socket
    
        def connection_ready(sock, fd, events):
            while True:
                try:
                    connection, address = sock.accept()
                except socket.error as e:
                    if e.args[0] not in (errno.EWOULDBLOCK, errno.EAGAIN):
                        raise
                    return
                connection.setblocking(0)
                handle_connection(connection, address)
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)
    
            io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
            callback = functools.partial(connection_ready, sock)
            io_loop.add_handler(sock.fileno(), callback, io_loop.READ)
            io_loop.start()
    
    .. testoutput::
       :hide:
    
    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                return
            self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the function will correctly check for an existing current IOLoop instance before trying to make the new instance current. This should prevent the error and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
