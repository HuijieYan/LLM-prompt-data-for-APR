### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object.
- It takes an optional argument `make_current` which determines whether the current IOLoop instance should be set as the current IOLoop object or not.
- The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential Error Location:
- The issue is likely in the condition where `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance does not exist. It should instead check if the instance exists when `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the condition to check whether the IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True` and handle the case accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """


    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This fix should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
