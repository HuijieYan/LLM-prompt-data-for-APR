### Analysis:
1. The provided function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class.
2. It is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance as the current thread's `IOLoop`.
3. The error message indicates that the method is raising a `RuntimeError` because `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing.
4. The bug occurs when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current=True` is passed as an argument.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic handling in the `initialize` method. When `make_current=True` is passed, the method is checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is one, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though `make_current=True` was explicitly specified.

### Bug Fix:
The strategy to fix this bug is to modify the logic in the `initialize` method so that it does not check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        # Check if make_current is None or False, then proceed with logic
        if make_current is None or not make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        # When make_current=True, directly set the instance as the current IOLoop
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method will only check for an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is None or False. If `make_current=True`, it will directly set the instance as the current `IOLoop` without checking for existing instances.
