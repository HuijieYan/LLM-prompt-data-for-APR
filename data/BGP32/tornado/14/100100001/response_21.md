## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is None, and if so, it calls `make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is None.
2. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None. If it is not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`, otherwise, it calls `make_current()`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is already initialized. It should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case as well.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is already initialized. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix to the `initialize` function, it should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
