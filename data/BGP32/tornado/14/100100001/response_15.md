## Error Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The logic to check if the current `IOLoop` already exists is flawed, leading to the `RuntimeError` not being raised when it should be.
2. The `initialize` function is not properly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before creating a new one.

## Bug Cause:
The `initialize` function does not correctly handle the logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before creating a new one. This leads to the bug where a second attempt to make the current `IOLoop` instance fails to raise a `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. Check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After updating the `initialize` function as shown above, it should correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
