The issue with the buggy function lies in the logic of when to call `self.make_current()` based on the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the RuntimeError to be raised incorrectly in some scenarios.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the `self.make_current()` method is called if the current IOLoop instance does not already exist. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this modification, the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and not raise a RuntimeError when it shouldn't.

After implementing this change, the test function `test_force_current` should pass without raising any errors.
