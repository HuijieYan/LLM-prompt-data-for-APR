The bug in the provided `initialize` function lies in the conditional logic regarding the `make_current` parameter. The bug causes the function to incorrectly throw a `RuntimeError` even when the condition for it to be raised is not met.

The issue arises from the check in the `elif make_current` block. It erroneously checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` instead of checking if it is not `None`. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and align with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test `test_force_current`. This should result in the test passing successfully.
