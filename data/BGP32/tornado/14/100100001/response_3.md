## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is trying to ensure that only one instance of an IOLoop is currently active, and if `make_current` is specified, it should enforce that behavior. However, the issue arises when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.

## Identified Bug:
The bug in the current function is that even if a current IOLoop instance exists, it does not prevent the creation of a new instance with `make_current=True` as desired. This leads to a RuntimeError being raised incorrectly in certain scenarios.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by not checking correctly if a current IOLoop instance exists when trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`. The logic does not enforce the single instance constraint properly.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle cases where a current IOLoop instance already exists. We should prevent the creation of a new instance if `make_current=True` and there is an existing instance.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By checking the existing `IOLoop.current()` instance properly and adjusting the conditions for creating a new instance, we can fix the bug in the `initialize` function. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
