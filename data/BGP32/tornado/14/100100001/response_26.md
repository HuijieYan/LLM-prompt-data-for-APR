The issue with the buggy function `initialize` lies in the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly handling the scenario when `make_current=True`.

Here is an updated version of the `initialize` function with the bug fixed:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Updated and fixed version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        curr_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if curr_io_loop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original code results in the incorrect handling of the condition for creating a new current IOLoop instance. The if condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be corrected to check if the current instance already exists when `make_current=True`. This is addressed in the updated code by storing the current IOLoop instance in `curr_io_loop` variable and checking if it exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop.

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test scenario provided.
