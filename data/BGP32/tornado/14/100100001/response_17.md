The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. The function should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case, but it is not doing so.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, then raise a `RuntimeError`. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the failing test should now pass successfully. The corrected `initialize` function will raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if the current instance already exists.
