The buggy function `initialize` is failing when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. This is evident from the failing test `test_force_current` where a RuntimeError is expected when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`. If the current instance already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should now handle the case where a new IOLoop instance cannot be created when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing instance. The corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
