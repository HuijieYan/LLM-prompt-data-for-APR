## Analysis:
1. The initialize function in the buggy file expects a parameter `make_current`, which defaults to `None`.
2. It checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it calls `make_current()` if the current IOLoop instance is None.
3. If `make_current` is not None and evaluates to True, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is already created, and if not, raises a RuntimeError.
4. The buggy function is not handling the case where `make_current` is False.
5. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, and then tries to create another instance with the same parameter, which should raise a RuntimeError as per the expected behavior.

## Bug:
The bug in the initialize function is that it does not handle the case when `make_current` is False. This leads to the RuntimeError not being raised when it should be in certain scenarios, as seen in the failing test.

## Fix strategy:
Add an `elif` statement to handle the case when `make_current` is False. In this case, we need to just call `self.make_current()` regardless of the current IOLoop instance's existence.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif not make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the function should now handle all cases where `make_current` is True, False, or None, ensuring the expected behavior and passing the failing test.
