## Corrected Version

```python
# Improved initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation:
The bug in the original initialize function lies in the condition for checking if the current IOLoop already exists. The logic should be reversed - if the current IOLoop instance exists and make_current is True, then raise an error. In the buggy code, the RuntimeError is being raised when the IOLoop instance does not exist.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when make_current is True.
2. If the current IOLoop instance already exists and make_current is set to True, raise a RuntimeError.
3. Update the function accordingly.

By making this change, the corrected function should now properly handle the case when a current IOLoop instance already exists.
