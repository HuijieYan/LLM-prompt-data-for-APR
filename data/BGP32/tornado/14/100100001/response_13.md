The buggy function `initialize` has an issue with handling the `make_current` parameter. The problem arises when `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of the IOLoop present. In this scenario, it should raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists. However, the current implementation fails to do so and proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of IOLoop. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that a `RuntimeError` will be raised if there is already a current instance of IOLoop present when `make_current` is True. This modification addresses the bug and the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
