## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file of the Tornado library.
2. The function tries to initialize an IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The bug seems to be related to handling the `make_current` parameter incorrectly.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to enforce the current IOLoop instance and expects an error when trying to create another one with `make_current=True`.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The function should prevent the creation of a new IOLoop instance if one already exists and is set as the current instance. However, in the current implementation, it allows creating multiple instances with `make_current=True`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance is already set as the current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. This will prevent creating a new instance when one is already marked as the current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function initialize
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version of the `initialize` function provided above, it should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` successfully.
