### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is failing to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is provided as `True` and the current instance already exists. This is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail, as it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised in that scenario but it is not happening.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the logic when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists. The current implementation does not handle this case properly, leading to the failure.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists. The current logic only checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, but it does not consider the scenario where it exists and `make_current` is also `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to check if the current instance already exists when `make_current` is `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class, it should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
