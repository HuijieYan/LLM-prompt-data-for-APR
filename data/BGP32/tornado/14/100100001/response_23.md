### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance. The issue arises when `make_current=True` is passed, and the current IOLoop instance already exists, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised. The bug occurs because the code does not handle this scenario properly.

### Identification of Bug:
The bug is located in the `initialize` function, specifically in the block where `make_current=True` is passed, and the current IOLoop instance already exists but is not handled correctly.

### Cause of Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function, which does not properly check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True` is passed. If the instance already exists, it should not attempt to create a new one and instead raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the changes and using the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the failing test should pass successfully.
