Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test function, we can see that the bug lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The problem is that when `make_current` is provided with a value of `True`, the function does not handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists correctly. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised when it should not be in some cases.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` method to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make it current. If it already exists, do not raise an error and simply set the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
            
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # If current instance already exists, just set it as current
            if current_instance == self:
                return
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` method now correctly handles the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should allow the failing test to pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
