## The corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Steps:
1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test:
   - The buggy function `initialize()` checks if a current IOLoop instance exists and then determines whether to make the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
   - The failing test function `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop object with `make_current=True` to force the creation of the current IOLoop instance and checks if it throws a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a second current IOLoop instance.

2. Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The conditions within the `if` and `elif` statements might not be handling the `make_current` parameter correctly, leading to incorrect behavior.

3. Explaining the cause of the bug:
   - The bug occurs in the original `initialize` function due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. It does not properly check if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to create a new one, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

4. Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the code to first retrieve the current IOLoop instance and then check the `make_current` parameter against it before attempting to create or raise an exception based on the conditions.

5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function addresses the issue by first retrieving the current IOLoop instance and then appropriately checking the conditions based on the `make_current` parameter. This version should pass the failing test provided.

With these corrections, the function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test without any `RuntimeError` exceptions being raised.
