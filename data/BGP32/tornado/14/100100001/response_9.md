## Analysis:
The `initialize` function is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. It checks if a current instance exists and if not, it calls the `make_current` method. However, in the test function `test_force_current`, the expectation is that a RuntimeError should be raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` if a current instance already exists.

## Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it did not raise a RuntimeError as expected when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` while a current instance already exists.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, a RuntimeError is raised.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the test function `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
