The issue in the provided buggy function is the inconsistent use of `make_current`. The function `initialize` does not handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed when there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

The buggy code fails in the test `test_force_current` because it does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The raise of `RuntimeError` should occur only if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current=True` is also passed to create a new `IOLoop`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function now correctly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`. This change should make the failing test `test_force_current` pass.
