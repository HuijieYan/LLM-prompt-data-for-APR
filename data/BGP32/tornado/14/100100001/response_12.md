## Correction:

The issue in the buggy `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed, and an existing current `IOLoop` instance is already present. In such a scenario, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` as shown in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The fixed version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After replacing the buggy `initialize` function with the corrected version provided above, the failing test should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.

This fix ensures that when `make_current=True` is passed and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` is raised, preventing the creation of a second instance.
