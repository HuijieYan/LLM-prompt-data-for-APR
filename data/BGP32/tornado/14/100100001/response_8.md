The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic for handling the `make_current` argument. The issue arises when trying to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists; the logic for handling this condition is incorrect, leading to the function failing the test.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. Otherwise, we should proceed with setting the `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the logic inside the `initialize` function as shown above, it should now correctly handle the `make_current` argument and pass the failing test.
