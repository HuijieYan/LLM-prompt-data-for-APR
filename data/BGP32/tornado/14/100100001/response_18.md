The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not checking if the `make_current` flag is set to `True` before trying to make the current IOLoop. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised even if the `make_current` flag is not set to `True`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` flag is checked properly before attempting to make the current IOLoop. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Explanation of the fix:
- We changed the condition `elif make_current` to `elif make_current is True` to specifically check if `make_current` is `True`.
- Added a check to ensure that if the current IOLoop instance already exists and the `make_current` flag is `True`, then raise a `RuntimeError`.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the `make_current` flag and pass the failing test provided.
