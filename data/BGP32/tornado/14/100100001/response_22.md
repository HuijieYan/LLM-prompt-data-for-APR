Based on the buggy function and the failing test provided, the cause of the bug is that the `initialize` method does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to True and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance. The bug arises when the `initialize` method should raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current instance already exists, but it does not raise the exception as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to True and there is an existing current IOLoop instance. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario to prevent creating another IOLoop instance when one already exists.

Here is a corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `initialize` method will properly raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is set to True and an existing current IOLoop instance is already present.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
