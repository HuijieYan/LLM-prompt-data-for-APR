The bug in the `initialize` function is that the condition `if make_current is None` does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is False. This causes the `make_current` method to be called regardless of the value of `make_current`.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if `make_current` is False, and only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is True.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding `elif make_current is False`, we can differentiate between the cases when `make_current` is True or False and ensure that `self.make_current()` is only called when `make_current` is True.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test provided.
