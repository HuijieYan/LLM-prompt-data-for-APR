## Analysis:
The `initialize` function is intended to initialize an `IOLoop` instance and ensure that it is set as the current `IOLoop`. The bug arises when the `make_current` argument is provided as True and an existing current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is True and an existing current `IOLoop` instance is already set. The function incorrectly allows the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance without raising an error.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By fixing the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True, we ensure that the function behaves correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
