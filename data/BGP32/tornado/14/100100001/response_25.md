The cause of the bug is that the `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing before attempting to create a new instance. If a current instance already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing as expected. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
