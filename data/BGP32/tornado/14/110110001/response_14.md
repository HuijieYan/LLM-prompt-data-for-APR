### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado` library is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and manage the current IOLoop instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another one, which should raise a `RuntimeError` since only one current IOLoop instance can exist.
3. The failing test fails with a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, which is the expected behavior.
   
### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class where the logic for checking the existence of a current IOLoop and determining whether to make the IOLoop instance current is incorrect. The logic leads to attempting to make multiple IOLoop instances current.

### Fix:
1. Modify the logic of the `initialize` function to only allow one current IOLoop instance and throw a `RuntimeError` if an attempt is made to create another current instance.
2. Remove the unnecessary check if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before making the IOLoop instance current since that check is already handled in the `make_current` method.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will only make the instance current if `make_current=True` is specified. This will prevent multiple current instances from being created.
