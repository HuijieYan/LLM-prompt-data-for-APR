## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize an instance of `IOLoop` and potentially make it the current `IOLoop`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error when another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is created subsequently.
- The error message indicates that the creation of the second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is causing a `RuntimeError` because a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Error Location:
- The issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class.
- When `make_current=True` is passed, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists without considering the actual value of `make_current`.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the `initialize` function only checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. It does not handle the case where the `make_current` parameter is not set, which should default to making the current `IOLoop` unless one already exists.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to consider the case where `make_current` is not explicitly set.
- We should check for a current `IOLoop` instance regardless of the value of `make_current` and ensure the new instance either becomes the current one or raises an error if a current instance already exists.

## Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass successfully without raising a `RuntimeError`.
