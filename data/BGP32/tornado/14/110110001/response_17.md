### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The error occurs when trying to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The buggy function checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make the new instance current. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. The logic assumes that if there is no current instance and `make_current` is `True`, it should make the new instance current. Instead, it should only make the new instance current if there is no current instance and `make_current` is `True`.
5. To fix the bug, the condition for checking an existing current instance needs to be properly handled.

### Correction:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class definitions...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance in the `initialize` method, the bug should be fixed.
