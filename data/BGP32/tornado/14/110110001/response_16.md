### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current instance already exists and raises an error if `make_current=True` and a current instance is already present.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current instance is the same.
3. The error message shows that the bug occurs when trying to set the current instance when it already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. It should not try to set the current instance if it is already present.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance already present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the function checks for the presence of a current instance and only sets the current instance if `make_current=True` and no current instance is present. The corrected version should pass the failing test.
