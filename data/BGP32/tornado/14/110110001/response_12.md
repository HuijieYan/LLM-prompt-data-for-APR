### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The test function `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is failing due to an error in the `initialize` function.
3. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it fails with a `RuntimeError` because it detects that a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The bug occurs because when `make_current=True`, the function checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists before making the new instance current. If it does, it correctly raises a `RuntimeError`, but it should not make the new instance the current instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `initialize` function logic to prevent setting a new `IOLoop` instance as the current instance if a current instance already exists.
2. Only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version should now pass the failing test.
