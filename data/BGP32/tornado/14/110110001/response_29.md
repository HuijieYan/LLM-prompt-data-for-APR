### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The `initialize` function is called with a `make_current` argument, which is used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it expects the creation to raise a `RuntimeError` because a current instance already exists. The error message confirms that the `RuntimeError` is indeed being raised.
4. The bug is caused by not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to explicitly check for a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.


### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Ensure that if `make_current=None`, the default behavior follows (making the `IOLoop` instance current if no instance is currently set).
3. Update the logic within the `initialize` function to handle the above cases correctly.


### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance_exists = IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None
        
        if make_current is None:
            if not current_instance_exists:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance_exists:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above changes, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
