The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is causing an issue with the test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current=True`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic inside the `initialize` function where it checks if the current `IOLoop` exists.
2. The conditions for checking `make_current`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is incorrectly handling the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance. When `make_current=True`, the function should only proceed if there is no current `IOLoop` instance. However, the current logic is raising a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The function should only make the current `IOLoop` instance if one doesn't already exist. If there is an existing instance, the function should return gracefully without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if current loop exists
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected code should now pass the failing test without raising a `RuntimeError`.
