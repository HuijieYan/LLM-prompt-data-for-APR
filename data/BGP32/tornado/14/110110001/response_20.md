## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The test code is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then asserts that the created instance is the current `IOLoop`. It also expects an error when trying to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The buggy function is incorrectly handling the case when `make_current=True`. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current without considering the case where a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle the scenario when creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The code should check if the current instance is the same as the instance being created before raising an error.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By comparing the current instance to the instance being created, we ensure that the error is only raised if the existing current instance is not the same as the one being created with `make_current=True`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test.
