### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class expects a `make_current` parameter, which is used to control whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be made default.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and an existing current `IOLoop` instance is already present.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to instantiate a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The error message shows that the RuntimeError is raised when trying to set `make_current=True` with an already existing current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.
5. We should modify the function to only raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

### Updated/Copied Function (Corrected Version):
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None when `make_current` is set to `True`, we can prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised unnecessarily.
