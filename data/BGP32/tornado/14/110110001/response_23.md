### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is within the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado` module, specifically the `initialize` method.
2. The function aims to either make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `None`, or raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.
3. The test function is creating an `IOLoop` instance and trying to force it to be the current instance using the `make_current` argument. The test then checks if the instance is equal to the current instance. The error occurs when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug is in not handling the scenario when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists. The function is missing a check to raise an error in this specific case.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` method to handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance is not `None` and raises an error if so.
- When `make_current` is `None`, it makes the current instance only if no instance currently exists.
- The logic is adjusted to prevent an error if a `RuntimeError` condition is met.
