### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` in the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The potential error location is in the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is True, but current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that if `make_current=True`, the code does not correctly handle the case when the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current=True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
5. Corrected code below:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
