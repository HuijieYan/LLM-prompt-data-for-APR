### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it makes the current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, but it fails because the function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if it already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we should allow the initialization with `make_current=True` even if there is already a current instance, as long as `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function should only check for an existing instance if `make_current` is not explicitly set to `True`.

### Correction:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
