## Error Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not handling the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists properly.
2. The function checks if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance, then it tries to make itself the current instance. However, if there is already a current instance, it should raise an error instead of proceeding to make itself the current instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` checks for this behavior and expects the RuntimeError to be raised if a second `make_current=True` construction occurs when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.
2. Check if there is already a current instance before trying to make itself the current instance when `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if a second attempt is made with `make_current=True` when a current instance is already present.
