#### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The test function `test_force_current` is from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.
3. The failing test is checking whether creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` throws a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
4. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists.
   
#### Buggy Code Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize` inside the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists, then it raises a `RuntimeError` saying that current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the error is likely occurring because the check uses `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which may not correctly determine if there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic to correctly determine if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

#### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition to check if `IOLoop.current()` is not `None` in the `elif make_current` branch, we ensure that the correct check is made before raising the `RuntimeError`. This revised logic should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
