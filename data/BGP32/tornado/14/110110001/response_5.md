### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The `initialize` method is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it has a bug where it incorrectly raises an error when `make_current=True` even if there is no current instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but the error is raised incorrectly due to the bug in the `initialize` method.
4. The bug is caused by the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` method. This condition should only apply when `make_current=None`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions in the `initialize` method so that the error is only raised if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition for raising the error to only apply when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.
2. Update the logic to correctly set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of the `make_current` argument.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function should now correctly set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of the `make_current` argument, and the failing test should pass without raising an error.
