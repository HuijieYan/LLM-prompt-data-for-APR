### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current event loop as the default one, based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The buggy test function `test_force_current` tries to create an event loop with `make_current=True` and then checks if it is set as the current loop. It also checks if attempting to create a second event loop with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs when the second event loop is created with `make_current=True`, and it tries to set the current loop when one already exists, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.

### Error Cause:
The bug is caused because the `initialize` method does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current event loop already exists. It should raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current event loop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the existing current event loop when `make_current=True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists.
2. Modify the `initialize` method to handle this case properly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version adds a check for the current event loop when `make_current=True` and raises a `RuntimeError` if a current event loop already exists. This will ensure that attempting to set the current loop when one is already set will raise an error.
