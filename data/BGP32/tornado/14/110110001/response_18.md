### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function should only set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and if there is no current instance already.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks for errors if a current instance already exists.
4. The failing test triggers an error due to the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
5. The error message indicates that the function is attempting to create a new instance even though a current instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the `initialize` function incorrectly handling the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. It should raise an error in this case, but the current implementation does not properly check the existing instance.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to properly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to set a new one. If `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
