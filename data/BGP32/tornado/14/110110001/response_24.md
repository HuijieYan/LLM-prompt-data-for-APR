### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking whether the `make_current` argument is True, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The failing test case `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with the same argument which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` function is not handling this case correctly.
3. The failing test is trying to enforce only a single current `IOLoop` instance, but the current implementation of the `initialize` function does not prevent the creation of multiple current instances.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to ensure that only one current `IOLoop` instance exists at a time when `make_current=True`.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly raise a `RuntimeError` if an attempt is made to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` while a current instance already exists.
