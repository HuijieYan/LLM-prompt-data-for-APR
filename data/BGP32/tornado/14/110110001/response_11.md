### Analysis:
1. The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class is `initialize`, which is expecting a `make_current` argument to determine the behavior of the IOLoop instance.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is None and then calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to see if there is already a current IOLoop. If not, it calls `self.make_current()`.
3. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the created instance is the current IOLoop. It expects the creation to fail with a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists" even when `make_current=True` is passed.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True` is passed, it first checks if there is no current IOLoop instance and then calls `self.make_current()`. But internally in `make_current`, it checks again if a current IOLoop instance exists and raises an error.
The logic inside the `initialize` function is redundant when `make_current=True`, as it should simply set the IOLoop instance as the current instance without checking again.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, modify the `initialize` function such that when `make_current=True`, it directly sets the current IOLoop instance without checking again if one already exists.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version removes the redundant check in the case where `make_current=True` is passed, resolving the bug.
