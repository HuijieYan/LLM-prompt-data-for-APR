## Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado` library is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and making it the current IOLoop if specified.
   
2. **Buggy Class**: The `IOLoop` class provided is a subclass of `Configurable` which is responsible for handling I/O events on various platforms.

3. **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_force_current` in the `tornado.test.ioloop_test` module attempts to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then verifies that subsequent attempts to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

4. **Error Message**: The failing test raised a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when the second attempt was made to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True`.

## Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` method lies in the condition where `make_current` is `True`. The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly even when there is no current existing instance of the IOLoop.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to check the current instance only when `make_current` is `True`, and if a current instance already exists, only then raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `False` or `None`, skip the current instance check.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, we check if `make_current` is not `None`, and if it is `True`, only then we check for the current instance of IOLoop. This approach ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
