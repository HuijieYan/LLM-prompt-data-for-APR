### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the initialization logic of an IOLoop instance, including ensuring that there is only one current IOLoop instance at a time.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to become the current IOLoop instance. However, the buggy function implementation is raising a `RuntimeError` even though the current IOLoop instance doesn't exist yet.
3. The bug is caused by the check for existing current IOLoop incorrectly throwing an error, even if there is no current IOLoop instance.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks in the `initialize` method:
- When `make_current=True`, only raise an error if there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.
- If `make_current=False`, the new IOLoop should not try to become current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above change, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test.
