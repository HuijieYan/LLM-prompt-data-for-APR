### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object.
2. The function takes an optional argument `make_current`, which determines whether the current `IOLoop` object should be set as the current instance.
3. The failing test is testing the behavior when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists. It expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised in this scenario.
4. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is occurring because the current `IOLoop` object already exists.
5. The bug in the current function is that it is not correctly handling the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if the `make_current` argument is `True` and a current instance already exists. If this is the case, raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Also, ensure that if `make_current` is `False`, the existing current instance is not affected, and the new instance is not set as the current one.
3. Adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to handle these cases appropriately.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above changes to the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
