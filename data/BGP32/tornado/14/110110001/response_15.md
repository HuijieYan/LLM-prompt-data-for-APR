## Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The purpose of the `initialize` method is to set up the `IOLoop` instance with the provided arguments.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects it to become the current instance, and then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` which should fail and raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug is that the logic in the `initialize` method is incorrect, causing the RuntimeError to not be raised when it should.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` method occurs because the code path that should raise the `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` is not being executed as expected. This path is triggered when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance available. However, the current implementation incorrectly handles this case and does not raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug in the `initialize` method, we need to modify the conditional check for `make_current=True` to ensure that it raises a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After making this change, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test without raising any `RuntimeError`.
