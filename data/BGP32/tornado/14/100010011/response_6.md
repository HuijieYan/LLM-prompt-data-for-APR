### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has an issue where it is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists incorrectly.
- The error message indicates that the code is raising a `RuntimeError` because it incorrectly believes that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- The GitHub issue points out the discrepancy in the logic and questions why the code is raising "already exists" when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Error Location:
- The issue lies in the `if make_current is None:` branch where it should not raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
- The incorrect logic in the `if make_current:` branch is also problematic as it tries to validate the existence of the `IOLoop` instance without considering the `make_current` argument.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional checks in the `initialize` function. It mistakenly raises an error when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` based on the `make_current` argument.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:  # Correct the conditional check
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By correcting the conditional checks and properly handling the `make_current` argument, the updated `initialize` function should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
