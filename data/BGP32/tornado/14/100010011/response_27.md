1. Analyzing the buggy function:
   - The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is checking if the current IOLoop instance is already existed or not. If it does not exist and `make_current` is set to True, it raises a RuntimeError indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
  
2. Potential error locations:
   - The bug may be in the conditional check for the current IOLoop instance.
  
3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check. The logic is supposed to raise an error if `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. However, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be inverted to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to check if an IOLoop instance already exists.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the conditional check to check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True. If the instance already exists, then raise a RuntimeError.
  
5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional check as mentioned above, the function will properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to True. This correction should resolve the RuntimeError issue and pass the failing test.
