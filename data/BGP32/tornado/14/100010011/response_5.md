### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance is already present. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which seems contradictory.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is incorrect. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is correct to check if an instance does not exist. However, the bug arises because the condition `if make_current` is used instead of `if make_current is True` in the function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, modify the condition `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current is True:`. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
