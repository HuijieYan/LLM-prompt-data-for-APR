### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object. The bug is related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter, which determines whether to make the current IOLoop object.

### Potential Error Location:
1. The condition `if make_current is None:` may not be handling the cases correctly.
2. The check `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might not be functioning as expected.
3. The logic to raise an error when the current IOLoop object already exists might not be correctly implemented.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function is checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and then it raises an error even when the IOLoop object already exists. This is contradictory as it should only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and the IOLoop object already exists.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the condition to properly handle the cases based on the value of `make_current`.
2. Check if the current IOLoop instance exists before trying to make it current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections, the function now correctly checks if the IOLoop instance already exists before raising an error. This should resolve the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
