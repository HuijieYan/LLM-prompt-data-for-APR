### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is already present or not. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, which is contradictory to the intended behavior.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not correctly handling the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` argument might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling and interpretation of the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`. If the condition wrongly evaluates the current `IOLoop` instance as not `None`, it causes the incorrect behavior and the `RuntimeError` is raised even when it should not be.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should be revised to correctly determine if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument should also be reviewed to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The current `IOLoop` instance is first stored in a variable `current_ioloop`.
- The condition checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` is improved by using the stored variable `current_ioloop`.
- The logic for raising `RuntimeError` is adjusted to only raise it when a current `IOLoop` instance is detected and `make_current` is set to `True`.

By making these changes, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test while aligning with the intended behavior.
