### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set up the IOLoop object with a specific configuration.
- The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when the IOLoop instance already exists.
- The GitHub issue questions why the function raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition for `make_current` when `make_current` is `True` is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError`.
2. The check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance might be flawed.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is checking for the current IOLoop instance incorrectly. When `make_current` is `True`, the function expects the current IOLoop instance to already exist. However, a check is incorrectly raising an error even when the instance is set.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should only raise an error if the current instance is `None`. If an instance already exists, it should not raise an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. This corrected version should resolve the bug and make the failing test pass.
