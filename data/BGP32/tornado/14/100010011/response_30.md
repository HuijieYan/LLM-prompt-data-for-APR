### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`. The error message from the failing test indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even though the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is True.

### Bug:
The bug in the code lies in the logic of checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. When `make_current` is `True`, it's checking for the absence of the current `IOLoop` instance (`if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) before raising an error. However, the error message in the failing test suggests that the error is being raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, which contradicts the intended behavior.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we should check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and then either set it as the current `IOLoop` or raise an error accordingly. The logic to check for the current instance needs to be adjusted.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` block, we ensure that the error will only be raised when the current `IOLoop` instance exists as intended. This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue and should resolve the bug.
