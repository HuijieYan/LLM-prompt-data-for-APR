### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for setting up the current IOLoop instance.
- The error occurs when `make_current=True`, and the current IOLoop instance already exists. 
- The error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists, which contradicts the logic of creating a new one.
- The issue on GitHub questions why the "already exists" error is raised when the current IOLoop is None.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function does not properly check for the existing current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one.
- In the case where `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop already exists, it erroneously raises a RuntimeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that existing checks properly handle the scenario where the current IOLoop instance already exists.
- We should modify the logic to only attempt to create a new current IOLoop instance when none currently exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking for the existing current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should resolve the bug and address the issue raised on GitHub.
