### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. If an `IOLoop` instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".
- The error message indicates that the test `test_force_current` is failing because the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, but the code still raises an error stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
- The GitHub issue highlights the confusion or inconsistency in the logic, where it questions why the code is raising an error if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.
- The bug is likely in the logic where the error is raised even when the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is True.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should not raise an error because an `IOLoop` instance does not already exist.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to conditionally raise the error only when an existing `IOLoop` instance is detected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an instance already exists before raising an error
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test, resolve the GitHub issue, and behave as expected.
