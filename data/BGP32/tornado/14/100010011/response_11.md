### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance incorrectly. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

The error message in the failing test indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` at the point where it checks for existence and raises an error wrongly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing, and only then raise an error. However, the buggy implementation is raising an error if the current instance is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function so that it correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. When `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error only if the current instance is already existing.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, the function correctly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising an error. This modification ensures that the error is raised only when the current instance already exists.
