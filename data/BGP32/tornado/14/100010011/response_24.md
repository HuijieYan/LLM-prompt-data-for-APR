### Analysis:
The reported issue on GitHub highlights the confusion around the error message "current IOLoop already exists" being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`. This confusion suggests that the logic in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is not handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` correctly.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the logic that checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by a logical issue in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`), instead of creating a new instance, the code mistakenly raises an error message claiming that "current IOLoop already exists".

### Suggested Fix Strategy:
To resolve this bug, the `initialize` method should be modified to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` and `make_current` is True. In this scenario, a new `IOLoop` instance should be created instead of raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected version of the `initialize` method will create a new `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and the current instance does not exist, thus addressing the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
