### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to check if an IOLoop instance already exists or not, based on the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is not provided or is `None`, it should only create the current IOLoop instance if it doesn't already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if the current IOLoop instance already exists.

The error message and the GitHub issue suggest that the error occurs when `make_current` is `True`, but the current IOLoop instance already exists. This contradicts the purpose of the conditional check and results in the `RuntimeError` being raised when it shouldn't be.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for `make_current` within the `initialize` function.
2. The check for the current IOLoop instance within the conditional blocks.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the conditional check for `make_current`. The function should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance exists. However, the existing logic is checking for the current IOLoop instance within both branches of the conditional, leading to the error being raised even when `make_current` is `True` and the instance exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional check for `make_current` to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. The error should only be raised if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check within the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version ensures that the error is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. This change should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
