### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raising a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. However, the issue on GitHub points out that the condition to check if the current IOLoop is `None` or not None is causing confusion.
2. The error message indicates that when trying to force the creation of a new current IOLoop instance, the RuntimeError is raised because it is considering the instance already exists even though it may not.
3. The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not accurately determining if the current IOLoop instance exists or not, leading to the incorrect handling of the situation when `make_current=True`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance for more accuracy.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the condition to properly check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not, before deciding whether to make it the current instance or raise an error.

### Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:  # Update to instance=True for accurate check
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:  # Update to instance=True for accurate check
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition with `instance=True` in both the checks, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now accurately handle the situation when trying to force the creation of a new current IOLoop instance.

This correction should resolve the GitHub issue and allow the function to pass the failing test.
