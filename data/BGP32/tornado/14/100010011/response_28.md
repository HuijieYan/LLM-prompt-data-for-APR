### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking if the current `IOLoop` object already exists in two scenarios: when `make_current` is `None` and when `make_current` is `True`. The issue arises because when `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` object already exists, it should not raise an error.

### Error Location:
The bug is occurring in the `test_force_current` method of `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` when trying to force the current `IOLoop` instance. The error is raised because the current `IOLoop` object is already set, but the code is attempting to forcefully set it again.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to throw an error for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not properly handled when `make_current` is `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition for `make_current is None` to check if the current `IOLoop` already exists. If it exists, do not attempt to set it again.
2. Check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` object before setting it in both conditions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditions in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version handles the case where `make_current` is `None` correctly and avoids setting the `IOLoop` instance again if it already exists. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
