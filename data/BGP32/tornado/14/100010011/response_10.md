### Bug Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado.ioloop` module is intended to initialize an IOLoop instance. The bug occurs when the function is called with `make_current=True`, it should check if there is already a current IOLoop instance existing and only then raise an error if one is found.

The error message clearly states that the RuntimeError is being raised even though the current IOLoop instance is not None, which contradicts the logic in the buggy function.

### Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it prematurely checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and raises an error even when there is an existing instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is an existing current IOLoop instance. The function should only raise an error if `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one. This corrected version should resolve the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
