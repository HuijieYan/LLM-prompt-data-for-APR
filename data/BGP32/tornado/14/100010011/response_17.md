### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, a `RuntimeError` is being raised.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. It should raise a `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists.
4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - Update the condition to raise `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance exists.
   - Ensure that the logic correctly handles the scenarios where `make_current` is `None`.
  
### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True: # Changed the condition here to compare with True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: # Checking if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
