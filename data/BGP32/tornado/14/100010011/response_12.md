### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the presence of the current `IOLoop` instance incorrectly. It is raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. The bug is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail, triggering the `RuntimeError` as mentioned in the error message.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug is happening because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly raises an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, even though the expected behavior in this case is to make the current loop without raising an error.
  
### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. In this case, simply make the current loop without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version above, the function now correctly handles the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. It will make the existing loop current without raising an error.
