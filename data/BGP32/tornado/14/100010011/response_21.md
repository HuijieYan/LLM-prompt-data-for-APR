### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a logic issue with handling the `make_current` argument. The function is supposed to check if there is a current IOLoop instance, and if not, make the current IOLoop instance. However, the logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raising an error if it already exists is faulty.

### Error Cause:
The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even if there is no current IOLoop instance. This is contradictory to the intended behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there already exists a current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance` to avoid calling it multiple times.
- We then check the value of `make_current` and appropriately handle the logic based on the existence of the current IOLoop instance.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance (`current_instance is not None`), then we raise a `RuntimeError`.
- Otherwise, we proceed to make the current IOLoop instance if it does not exist.

This corrected version should address the bug and align the function's behavior with the intended logic.
