### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` and based on that, it either calls `self.make_current()` or raises a `RuntimeError`. The error message indicates that even though the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. This behavior is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic inside the `initialize` function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`, even though in this case, there is no existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is True. If there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is True, then we should proceed with setting the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes in the logic of the `initialize` function, the corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is True. If there is no current instance and `make_current` is True, the function will set the current instance without raising an unnecessary error.
