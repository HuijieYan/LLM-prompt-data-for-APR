### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it doesn't exist, it tries to make it the current one. However, there is a logic error where if `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This behavior contradicts the intended logic since the purpose of setting `make_current=True` should be to make the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't exist.

### Identified Error:
The error occurs because when `make_current=True`, the function is mistakenly checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if it exists, contrary to the expected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the incorrect logic flow in the `initialize` function. The condition `if make_current:` incorrectly raises an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when it should only make the current `IOLoop` if it doesn't exist.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. If the current `IOLoop` instance exists, it should not raise an error but should only make it the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_loop is not None:
            if current_loop == self:
                return  # current loop is already this instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the logic to compare the current `IOLoop` instance with the instance in the `initialize` function for `make_current=True`, we ensure that only the intended behavior is applied.
