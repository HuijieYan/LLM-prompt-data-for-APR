### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance in the `make_current=True` case, and raising a `RuntimeError` if it exists.
2. The `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message from the failing test indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance is not being properly checked before raising the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checking in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, which contradicts the assumption that `make_current` should force the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should only attempt to make the `IOLoop` instance current if it does not already exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Check if the current instance is not already the same instance
            if current_instance is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By adding an additional check to verify if the current `IOLoop` instance is not the same as the instance being initialized, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an instance other than the current one exists. This correction aligns with the expected behavior of `make_current=True`.
