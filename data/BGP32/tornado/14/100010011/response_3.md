### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the file `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The issue arises when `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `initialize` function when the condition `if make_current:` is met, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to incorrect logic handling in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the intention seems to be to make the current IOLoop instance. However, if an IOLoop instance already exists, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current IOLoop already exists, even though it should make that instance as the current one.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
```

With this corrected version, when `make_current=True`, if an IOLoop instance already exists, it will be set as the current instance. Otherwise, it will raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop does not exist. This adjustment addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensures correct behavior.
