### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object. The issue arises when the function is called with `make_current=True`, which should ensure that an IOLoop instance is made current. However, if an IOLoop instance already exists, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.

### Identified Error:
The issue lies in the conditional check when `make_current=True`. The function incorrectly raises the `RuntimeError` even if an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not correctly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`. It should only raise the `RuntimeError` if no IOLoop instance exists in that case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conditional check for `make_current=True` to only raise the `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance does not already exist.
- Update the logic to first check if an IOLoop instance already exists and then decide whether to make it current or raise an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should now handle the initialization of the IOLoop object correctly.
