### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists before creating a new one. If `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the loop already exists. However, based on the provided error message from the failing test, the issue seems to be with the logic of checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. The error message is raised even when the instance does exist.

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, where it incorrectly assumes that if the current instance is `None`, then it does not exist.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not the correct way to check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. This condition only checks if the current instance is `None`, which can be misleading.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to more accurately check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. We should check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a valid instance of `IOLoop` instead of just checking for `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that the function correctly checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists before raising a `RuntimeError`. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
