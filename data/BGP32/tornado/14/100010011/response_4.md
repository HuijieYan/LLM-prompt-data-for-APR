### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is True, the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when `make_current` is specified as True, but an IOLoop instance already exists, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance does not exist and `make_current` is True.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop. If an instance already exists and `make_current` is True, then no action should be taken. The `RuntimeError` should only be raised if an IOLoop instance does not exist and `make_current` is True.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None: # Check if IOLoop instance already exists
            return  # If instance exists, do nothing
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected function should now handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to True, preventing the erroneous `RuntimeError`.
