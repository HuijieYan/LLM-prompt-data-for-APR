### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None or already exists before making the current instance.
- The error message points out that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.
- The GitHub issue questions why the error is raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None on line 252.
- The bug seems to occur when checking for the current `IOLoop` instance validity.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Incorrect logic when checking for the current `IOLoop` instance existence.
- Inconsistent behavior in handling `make_current` parameter.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly raising an error when a new `IOLoop` instance is supposed to be created (`make_current=True`).
- The check for the current `IOLoop` instance validity is not correctly handling the case when a new instance is expected, resulting in the misleading error message.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when a new `IOLoop` instance needs to be created with `make_current=True`.
- Ensure that the check for the current `IOLoop` instance validity is consistent and accurate.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that the handling of the `make_current` parameter and the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is done accurately. This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and pass the failing test.
