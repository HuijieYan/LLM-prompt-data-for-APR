### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of an instance of the `IOLoop` class with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`. The issue seems to be related to checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not.

2. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error incorrectly.

3. The issue arises because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current=True` is passed, it should check if a current instance exists and if so, raise an error. However, the current implementation is raising an error when a current instance does not exist.

4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly verify the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Update the logic to raise an error only when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Change the existing initialize function as follows.

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists based on the `make_current` parameter being passed. This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
