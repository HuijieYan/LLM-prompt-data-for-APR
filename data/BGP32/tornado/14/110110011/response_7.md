### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, including setting it as the current instance if needed.
2. The bug occurs in the logic where it checks if a current instance of the `IOLoop` class exists or not, leading to the incorrect raising of an error.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then attempts to create another instance with the same flag, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, due to the bug in the `initialize` function, the error is being raised incorrectly.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` exists, it should raise an error, but instead, it is raising the error when the current instance is `None`.
5. To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. 

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Changed logic to check if current instance is not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the simple logical change of checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None` when `make_current=True`, the bug in the function is fixed. This correction ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is actually a current instance present.
