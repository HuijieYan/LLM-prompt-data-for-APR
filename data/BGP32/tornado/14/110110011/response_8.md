### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, then it calls `make_current()` method. If `make_current` is True and the current instance is None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then it tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

3. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance even though the current `IOLoop` instance is None according to the logic in the `initialize` function.

4. The GitHub issue points out the confusion over the logic in line 252 (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) and the logic leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be occurring because of the incorrect logic flow in the `initialize` function. The check for existing `IOLoop` instance and raising of the `RuntimeError` is not properly handled.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the scenario where the `make_current` parameter is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Updated initialize function in IOLoop class

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # other class code
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None when `make_current` is True, and raising `RuntimeError` only if an instance exists, we can fix the bug. The corrected version should now correctly handle the scenario described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
