### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance under certain conditions.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument to the `IOLoop` constructor, and the `IOLoop` instance is already set as the current instance.
3. The bug is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly, stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though it does not.
4. The issue on GitHub highlights the inconsistency between the check at line 252 (`if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) and the subsequent logic in the `initialize` function.
5. The bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the instance check for the current `IOLoop`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and the current instance exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise error only if current instance exists
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the error is only raised when necessary. This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test mentioned.
