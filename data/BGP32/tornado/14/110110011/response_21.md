### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current instance of the `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` parameter passed to it.
2. The issue seems to be with how the current instance of `IOLoop` is handled when `make_current` is `True`.
3. The failing test is checking if creating a new instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError` when another current instance already exists.
4. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is indeed being raised when it should not.
5. The GitHub issue points out the discrepancy in behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` but the function still raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Error:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function is checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. Even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the function still raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True`, even though it should only raise an error if a current instance already exists.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` and `make_current=True`. The logic should only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected logic in place, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current=True`. This adjustment should make the function behave as expected and pass the failing test case.
