### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize an IOLoop object with the option to make it the current instance. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. **Test Function**: The `test_force_current` test function in `ioloop_test.py` attempts to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if it is the current instance. It also checks that a second attempt to create a current instance should fail with a `RuntimeError`.

3. **Error**: The test fails with a `RuntimeError` because when `make_current` is `True`, the code checks if the current instance is `None` before raising an error, which results in the incorrect behavior.

4. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py`, where it checks if the current instance is `None` before raising an "already exists" error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- In the `initialize` function:
  - If `make_current` is `True`, directly call `self.make_current()`.
  - If `make_current` is `False`, check if there is already a current instance and raise `RuntimeError` accordingly.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change the condition to check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should behave as expected and pass the `test_force_current` test without raising an error.
