### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for checking and setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and verifies that it becomes the current instance.
3. The error occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. This triggers the `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect check in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is `True`, the existing current instance check should be inverted to ensure that an error is raised only if no instance exists. 

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `if` condition to check if the current instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the error is raised only when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test to pass successfully.
