### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:**
   - The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
   - This function is called during the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance and is responsible for checking the current status of the `IOLoop`.

2. **Error Location in Buggy Function:**
   - The error seems to be in the logic of checking the current `IOLoop` instance and deciding whether to make the current instance.
   - The issue arises when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The `initialize` function is incorrectly raising an error when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.
   - The error message "current IOLoop already exists" is thrown when it should actually allow the creation of a new instance as the existing instance should not affect the creation process.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - The logic should be adjusted to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.
   - If there is no existing instance and `make_current=True`, the new instance should be made current without any errors.
   
5. **Corrected Version:**
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        # Check if there is no current instance
        if current_instance is None:
            if make_current or make_current is None:  # Making current when make_current=True or unspecified
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # If make_current=True and there is an existing instance, raise an error
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By adjusting the logic as shown above, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test case.
