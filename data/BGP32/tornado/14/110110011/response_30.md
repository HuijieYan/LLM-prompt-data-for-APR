### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function:** The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class sets the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and makes the current instance if it does not exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if there is a current instance, and if not, raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. **Error Location:** The issue seems to be in the logic of checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The failing test `test_force_current` expects that trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
   - The bug occurs because the `initialize` function doesn't distinguish between the cases where `make_current` is `None` and when it is `True`. In both cases, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does not, it tries to make the current instance. This leads to the incorrect behavior where it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` but no current instance exists.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - Update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` differently from when it is explicitly `True`.
   - Only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
   
### Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic to check for the presence of a current instance only when `make_current` is explicitly `True`, the issue should be resolved.
