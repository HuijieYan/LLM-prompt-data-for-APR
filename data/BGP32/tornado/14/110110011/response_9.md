### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not to determine whether to make the current instance or raise an error. The issue lies in the logic where it should handle cases where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then asserts that it is the current instance. It then tries to create a new instance with `make_current=True` again, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is indeed being raised because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. One strategy to fix this bug is to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where no current `IOLoop` instance exists. We should only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and a current instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. This fix should address the bug reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
