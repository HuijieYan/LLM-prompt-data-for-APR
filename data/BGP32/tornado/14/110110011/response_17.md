### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The function is intended to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance, specifically handling the `make_current` argument.
3. The bug appears to be related to incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument, leading to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` error in the failing test.
4. The failing test (`test_force_current`) expects that attempting to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop already exists.
5. The bug stems from not properly checking the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to make the new IOLoop current.
   
### Suggested fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check the existence of a current IOLoop before attempting to set the new one as current. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check in the `elif` statement to verify that a current IOLoop exists before raising an error, we ensure that the function behaves as expected.

This fix addresses the root cause of the bug observed in the failing test, resolving the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` issue.

By implementing this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and resolve the GitHub issue related to the incorrect behavior seen in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class.
