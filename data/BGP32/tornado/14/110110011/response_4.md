### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, and then checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current instance, it tries to make the current instance. However, if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then checks if the instance is the current `IOLoop`. It expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.
   
3. From the error message, it seems that the error is occurring when trying to create a new `EPollIOLoop` instance, which inherits the `initialize` method from the `IOLoop` class. The error occurs because even if `make_current=True`, it checks if there is already a current instance and raises an error if it exists.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function's logic in the `initialize` method is flawed. It raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to make a new `IOLoop` instance the current one even if `make_current=True` flag is used and there is already a current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` method to handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current=False`, it should proceed to set the current instance. If `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, it should not raise an error, as the intention is to forcefully make it the current instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function as shown above, we fix the bug by correctly handling the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance, allowing the new instance to become the current one forcefully.
