### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop object and manage the current IOLoop instance.
   
2. **Relation to Buggy Class**: The `IOLoop` class is a level-triggered I/O loop class, meant for handling I/O events in Tornado applications.

3. **Test Code**: The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current instance matches the created one. It also expects an error to be raised if a second attempt is made to create a current instance.

4. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the function is trying to raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, even though it should not exist based on the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`.

5. **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue questions why the code raises an error stating "current IOLoop already exists" when the check for current instance being `None` passes.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` method when it checks if a current IOLoop instance exists. The logic is incorrectly implemented, leading to the wrong error message to be raised.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case where a current IOLoop instance exists while trying to set a new current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the current IOLoop instance in a variable for better readability and to execute the check only once.
- The `if` condition checks if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current instance, then it makes the current instance.
- The `elif` condition checks if `make_current` is `True` and if there is already a current instance, then it raises the `RuntimeError`.
- The `self.make_current()` call is made in both conditions where needed.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle setting the current IOLoop instance.
