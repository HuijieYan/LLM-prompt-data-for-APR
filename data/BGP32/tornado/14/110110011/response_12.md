### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for handling the initialization of the IOLoop instance. The function checks the `make_current` parameter to determine if the current `IOLoop` should be set as the current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `ioloop_test.py` file tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug occurs when the function tries to check if the current `IOLoop` is None or not, and then decides to raise an error accordingly. However, the logic seems flawed as it first checks if the current `IOLoop` is None, but then raises an error if it is not None, leading to the issue reported in the GitHub issue.
4. To fix the bug, the logic within the `initialize` function should be adjusted to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current=True` is passed.
5. A strategy would be to modify the condition where the error is raised for a better check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance. 

### Fixed Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to first check if the `current_ioloop` is not None when `make_current=True`, we can avoid the issue of raising an error when the current `IOLoop` already exists. This corrected version should address the bug and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
