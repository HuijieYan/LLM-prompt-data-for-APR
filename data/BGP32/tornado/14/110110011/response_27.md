### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is None or not. If it is None, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If there is no current instance, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True, it again checks if there is a current instance. If there is no current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. It then checks if the created instance is the current instance using `IOLoop.current()`. It expects an error to be raised when attempting to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.

3. The failing occurs because the buggy function assumes that when `make_current=True`, there should not be any current instance, which is contradictory to the actual behavior where `make_current=True` just makes the current instance being created as the current one without regard for existing instances.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.

### Bug Fix:
Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing class definition
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition for `make_current=True` to check if a current instance already exists, we can prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised when it shouldn't. This fix ensures that the behavior aligns with the expected functionality as described in the comments of the function.
