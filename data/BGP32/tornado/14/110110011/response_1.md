### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class from `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` from `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects it to be the current instance, and then tests whether attempting to create a second instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message points to the exact location of the issue in the `initialize` function where a `RuntimeError` is mistakenly being raised when there is no current `IOLoop` instance.
4. The bug is likely occurring because the conditional check for `make_current is None` is incorrectly processing the logic when `make_current` is `True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The `initialize` function raises a `RuntimeError` incorrectly when `make_current` is `True` but there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. Ensure that when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, it sets the current instance to the current object.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment to the `initialize` function, the bug causing the incorrect `RuntimeError` to be raised when there is no current instance should be fixed. This corrected version ensures the expected behavior when `make_current` is provided as a parameter.
