### Analysis:
- **Buggy Function:** `initialize()` method in the `IOLoop` class.
- **Buggy Class:** `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`.
- **Failing Test:** `test_force_current()` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`.
- **Error Message:** `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.
- **GitHub Issue:** The issue is related to confusion regarding the logic in line 252 of `ioloop.py`.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to arise from the logic in the `initialize()` method where the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because of the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize()` method. When `make_current=True`, the code checks if the current `IOLoop` is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. This is contradictory logic, leading to the bug.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the logic aligns with the intended behavior. If `make_current=True`, it should only raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`. If `make_current=None`, it should set the current `IOLoop` if it does not exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# Corrected version of the initialize() method
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize()` method as shown above, the bug should be fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and align with the expected behavior based on the provided context.
