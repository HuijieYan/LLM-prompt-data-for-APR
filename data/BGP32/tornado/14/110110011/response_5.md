### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the logic for making the current IOLoop instance.
2. The `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and based on that, it either makes the current instance or raises an error if a current instance already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and check if the current instance is the same as the newly created instance.
4. The failing test expects that an error will be raised when trying to create a second current IOLoop instance, but due to a bug in the `initialize` function, the error is not being raised correctly.
5. The error message from the failing test shows that the error is not being raised when a current IOLoop already exists, leading to the test failure.
6. The GitHub issue points out the inconsistency in the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition for checking if `make_current` is `True` is not properly handling the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists. The function is supposed to raise an error in such a scenario, but it is not being triggered as expected.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the function correctly checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists and raises an error if it does.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly check if a current IOLoop instance exists and raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance is already present.
