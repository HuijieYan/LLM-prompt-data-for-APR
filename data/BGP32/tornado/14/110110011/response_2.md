### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is used to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current instance, if not, it sets the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` again, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` fails to properly determine if the current instance exists or not, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the current instance is correct and handles the `make_current` parameter appropriately.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the current instance check in the `initialize` function. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` wrongly checks if there is no current instance regardless of the value of `make_current`, leading to the improper error being raised.

### Correction:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first store the current instance in a variable to avoid redundant calls to the `IOLoop.current` method. Then, we check the value of `make_current` appropriately to ensure that the error is raised only when it is `True` and a current instance already exists.
