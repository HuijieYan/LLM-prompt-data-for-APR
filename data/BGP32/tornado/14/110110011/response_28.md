### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and setting the new instance as the current one if necessary.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should fail if there is already a current instance.
3. The failing occurs because in the `initialize` function, it first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is not, it still tries to set the new instance as the current one, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to avoid trying to set the instance as current if one already exists by modifying the logic inside the `initialize` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `initialize` function to only set the new instance as current if `make_current=True` and there is no current instance already.
2. Remove the redundant check for existing current instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
