### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**: The buggy function `initialize()` is a method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado` library. It is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error in the code occurs in the `initialize()` method where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current=True`.

3. **Bug Cause**:
   - The `initialize()` method checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True`.
   - If a current `IOLoop` instance is already present, it should raise an error, but in this case, it is incorrectly raising the error when a current instance is not present (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`).
   - This behavior contradicts the intended logic of the method and leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised at the wrong point.
   - The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Fix the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an instance already exists.
   - Ensure that the error is correctly raised based on the presence of a current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed: Check if current IOLoop is not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After making the above fix, the `initialize()` method will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` only when a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current=True`. This fix should resolve the issue observed in the failing test and the GitHub issue raised for this bug.
