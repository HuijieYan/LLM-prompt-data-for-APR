### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The error occurs when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The bug is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is contradictory.
4. The bug seems to stem from incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` argument and checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
5. The `initialize` function should be corrected to handle the `make_current` argument properly and avoid raising an error in case the current `IOLoop` is `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the logic where `make_current=True` is checked.
2. Incorrect handling of the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current=True`, a `RuntimeError` is being raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. This is contradictory as the error message states that the "current IOLoop already exists", even though the check for the existence of the current instance returns `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic when `make_current=True` to avoid raising a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. Ensure that the logic for creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is appropriately handled.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_io_loop is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this modification, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now properly handle the `make_current` argument without erroneously raising a `RuntimeError`.
