### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if so, tries to make the current instance. If `make_current` is True and the current instance is None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` again. This second attempt should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs because in the buggy function, even if `make_current` is True, if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of making the current instance.
4. To fix the bug, the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` should be removed in the case where `make_current` is True and the current instance is None.
  
### Correction:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition to check if the current instance is not None when `make_current` is True, the corrected version of the function will work as intended and pass the failing test.
