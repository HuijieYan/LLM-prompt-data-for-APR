### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship:**
    - The buggy function `initialize` is within the `IOLoop` class in the file `ioloop.py`.
    - It is related to the test code in `ioloop_test.py` where the `test_force_current` function is failing.

2. **Identified Error Location:**
    - The error seems to be occurring in the `initialize` function where the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance is flawed.
    
### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
- The buggy logic in the `initialize` function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does not, it tries to make the current instance. If `make_current=True`, it again checks if the current instance is `None` before making it current, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error when trying to create a second instance with the same flag.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `initialize` function:
1. If `make_current=True`, check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, raise an error. If it doesn't, then make this instance the current one.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is not None:
            if make_current:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop instance already exists")
                self.make_current()
            else:
                if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                    self.make_current()
```

By making these changes to the `initialize` function, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
