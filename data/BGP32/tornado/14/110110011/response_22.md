### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The function is designed to either create a new current `IOLoop` instance or raise an error if one already exists.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. It then checks whether the current `IOLoop` is the newly created one and then attempts to create another current instance (which should fail).
- The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when trying to create a new current `IOLoop` instance even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.
- The GitHub issue questions why the RuntimeError is being raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is None.
- The condition `elif make_current:` is triggered when `make_current=True`, which leads to checking if the current instance is None. If it is None, the function incorrectly raises a RuntimeError, stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, the logic within the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None, the function will now correctly handle the case of creating a new current instance when necessary.

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
