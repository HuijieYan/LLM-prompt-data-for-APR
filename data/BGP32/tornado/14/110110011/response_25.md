### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before setting a new instance as the current one. If `make_current` argument is set to `True`, it also checks if there is already a current instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if so.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current instance is the same. It also expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a second current instance.
3. The error occurs in the `initialize` function because it incorrectly checks if the current instance is `None` before raising `RuntimeError`, leading to the wrong error message.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of checking for an existing current instance to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below.

### Correction:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition checking logic as shown above, the corrected function will now correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. This change will allow the function to pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
