### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The error is occurring when the `make_current` argument is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The root cause of the bug lies in the conditional check where it raises an error even if current does not exist when `make_current=True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check to correctly handle the case when there is no current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current=True`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the fact that the conditional check in the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current=True`, the function should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error only if it exists. However, the current condition raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This incorrect check leads to the error when trying to force the creation of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditional statement in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is no current instance. We should only raise an error if there is already a current instance. Here's the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` and raise an error only if there is already an existing instance.
