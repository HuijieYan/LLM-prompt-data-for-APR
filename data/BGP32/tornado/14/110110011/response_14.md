### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and then trying to make it current based on the `make_current` parameter. However, if `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is already not None, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. Looking at the failing test `test_force_current`, it creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another one with the same parameter, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised due to the current `IOLoop` instance already existing.

3. The error message indicates that on line 252 of `ioloop.py`, the condition to raise `RuntimeError` is being triggered inappropriately when `make_current=True`.

4. The GitHub issue further highlights this confusion and seeks clarification on why the `RuntimeError` is being raised on line 252 even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` based on `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` check, it erroneously raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. This contradicts the expected behavior specified in the test `test_force_current`, leading to the failure.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is already set. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class methods and documentation
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, leading to passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
