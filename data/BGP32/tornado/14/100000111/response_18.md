### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is aimed at initializing the IOLoop object with an optional parameter `make_current`. The issue seems to indicate a problem with the logic of the function when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The condition `if make_current` might not be handling the case when `make_current` is `True` correctly.
2. The logic within the `if make_current` block where the `RuntimeError` is raised may not be appropriate.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current IOLoop instance is `None`, the function should not throw a `RuntimeError`, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should check if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop is `None`. If this is the case, we should then create a new IOLoop instance. Additionally, if `make_current` is `None`, we should only create a new instance if it doesn't already exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # New logic to handle the case when the current IOLoop exists
            # We don't need to raise an error, just leave the existing instance
            pass
```

By using this corrected version, the function should now properly handle the initialization of the IOLoop based on the `make_current` parameter, as well as address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
