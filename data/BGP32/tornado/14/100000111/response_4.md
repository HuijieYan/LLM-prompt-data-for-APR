## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists and initialize it if needed based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug arises when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for existence but then the error is raised "current IOLoop already exists" even when it doesn't.

## Identified Bug
The bug in the function arises from the conditional checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue specifically mentions that there is an inconsistency in the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked. This means that the logic within the `initialize` function does not handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` correctly.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the logic in the function wrongly assumes that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. This assumption is incorrect, leading to the premature raising of the "already exists" error.

## Fix Strategy
To address this bug, we need to modify the logic within the function to correctly handle the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. We should only raise the error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-None value while `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if current_ioloop is None:
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            # handle any other logic needed
            pass
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_ioloop` for better readability.
- We modified the condition to correctly handle the cases where `current_ioloop` is `None` or not `None`.
- If `current_ioloop` is None, we initialize the `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`.
- If `current_ioloop` is not None, we only raise the error if `make_current` is True.
- For all other cases, we can include additional logic if needed.
