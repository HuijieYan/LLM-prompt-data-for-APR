### Analysis:
The buggy function attempts to initialize an IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and creates one if not. If `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and raises an error if it does.

The bug occurs in the `elif make_current` block where it checks if an IOLoop instance exists. The bug arises when `make_current` is `True`, but an IOLoop instance is not present, leading to the incorrect `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic when checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance. The function erroneously raises an error when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance is not present, which is not the expected behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `elif make_current` block to handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, but no IOLoop instance exists. This can be done by checking both conditions separately and raising an error only if both conditions are met.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` but an IOLoop instance does not exist.
