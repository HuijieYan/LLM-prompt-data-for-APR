### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and then initializes it based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. There is a potential issue in the code where it checks if an `IOLoop` already exists even when `make_current` is `True`, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised mistakenly.

### Error Location
- The error lies in the `elif make_current:` block where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` without considering the condition that `make_current` is `True`. This can lead to the incorrect raising of a `RuntimeError` when an `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the `initialize` function to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, regardless of whether an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This does not match the expected behavior where a `RuntimeError` should only be raised if an `IOLoop` instance does not exist and `make_current` is `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if `current_instance` is `None` or not `None` before deciding to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the expected logic.
