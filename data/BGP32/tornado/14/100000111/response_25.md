### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current IOLoop instance within the initialization process. The issue arises when `make_current` is `True`, but the current IOLoop instance is already set. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current IOLoop already exists.

### Identified Error
1. When `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises an error even if the current IOLoop instance exists.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is due to the incorrect logic in the conditional statements. The function should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is already set. However, the current implementation also raises an error if `make_current` is `True` regardless of the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the function needs to be adjusted. Specifically, we need to check whether `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists before raising a `RuntimeError`. If the current IOLoop instance does not exist in this case, then the function should proceed with setting the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function properly checks whether the current IOLoop instance exists before deciding whether to raise a `RuntimeError`. It aligns with the expected input/output values and resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
