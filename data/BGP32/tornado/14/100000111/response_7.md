### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is aimed at setting the current IOLoop instance. However, the bug arises when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and the current IOLoop instance already exists, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly. The issue on GitHub highlights the specific problem, which is the unexpected raise of the error message when the current IOLoop instance already exists. 

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter.
2. Inconsistent logic in checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by a conditional statement that wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` even if the current IOLoop instance exists. This inconsistency leads to the error message being triggered unexpectedly.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance exists before deciding to make it current again. We need to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` separately based on the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance does not exist, aligning with the expected behavior and resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
