### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize an IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug lies in the condition checking logic. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists and raise an exception if it does. The current logic is flawed and does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Identified Errors:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` is not checking for the scenario where `make_current` is `True`.
2. There is a redundant check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` after the `elif` condition, which leads to incorrect behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The buggy function fails to correctly handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. As a result, the function does not raise an exception as expected but proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to correctly identify cases where `make_current` is `True`.
2. Remove the redundant check after the `elif` condition to prevent incorrect behavior.
3. Ensure that the function raises a `RuntimeError` when an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version updates the condition check for `make_current` and correctly handles the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists. It raises a `RuntimeError` as expected in such cases.
