### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug is in the condition check for `make_current` and whether the current IOLoop instance exists. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out this inconsistency where the condition results in `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then raises a runtime error despite the condition.

### Identified Bug
The bug lies in the condition checking logic for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The function is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the logic inside the conditional statements is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because of the incorrect checking of the current IOLoop instance in the conditions. When `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error only if the current instance already exists. However, due to the wrong condition check, the error is raised inappropriately.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenarios where `make_current` is `True` or `None`. We should ensure that the error is raised only when necessary, based on the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, `current_instance` is stored outside the conditional checks to avoid calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` multiple times. The condition checks are adjusted to properly handle the initialization based on the `make_current` parameter. This version should resolve the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values.
