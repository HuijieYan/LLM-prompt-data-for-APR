There are a few key issues with the buggy function `initialize`:

1. The logic for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` is inconsistent between the two conditions.
2. The logic for raising `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to handle both cases appropriately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic as shown above, we ensure that the function correctly checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it current. This updated version should address the issue as mentioned on GitHub and satisfy the expected input/output values.
