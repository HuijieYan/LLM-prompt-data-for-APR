Based on the provided information and the buggy function, the issue seems to be related to the condition checking inside the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop`. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, but due to the buggy logic, it is not handling the case where `make_current` is True and the `IOLoop.current` already exists correctly.

### Identified issue:
1. The condition `elif make_current:` is checking if `make_current` is True, but it does not handle the case where the `IOLoop.current` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is occurring because when `make_current` is True, the function does not correctly check if the `IOLoop.current` instance already exists, causing the RuntimeError to be incorrectly raised even when an instance exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition so that it first checks if `make_current` is True and then verifies if an `IOLoop.current` instance already exists. If an instance already exists, it should not raise the RuntimeError.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected function checks if the `make_current` flag is True and verifies if the `IOLoop.current` instance already exists before raising a RuntimeError. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
