## Analysis:

1. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it current if needed.
2. The issue on GitHub points out that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` at line 252, the function raises a `RuntimeError` despite not actually existing.
3. The bug in the code arises from the logic in the implementation. The condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` is not correctly handled.
4. The strategy to fix the bug would be to accurately handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` and when it is `True`. Also, the `if` condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists needs to be corrected.

## Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`.
- The condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists has been fixed to align with the expected behavior.
