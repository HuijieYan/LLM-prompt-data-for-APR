### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` takes a parameter `make_current` which is expected to be a boolean.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If not, it calls `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If not, it raises a `RuntimeError` or calls `self.make_current()`.
4. The issue on GitHub indicates a concern with the behavior of the function when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` evaluates to `None`.

### Error Locations:
1. The logic that checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` seems to be the potential error location as indicated by the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the condition where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If the condition is met, the function should create a new IOLoop instance. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and can lead to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, a new IOLoop instance is created.

### Correction:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By modifying the `elif` condition to also create a new IOLoop instance when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, we ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
