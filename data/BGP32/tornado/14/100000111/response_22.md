### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance. The issue points out that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the function still raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior is contradictory and needs to be fixed.

### Error Location
The bug is present in the `initialize` function logic where it raises an error with the message "current IOLoop already exists" even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs because of the conflicting conditions in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the intention seems to be that an `IOLoop` instance should already exist, leading to the `RuntimeError`. However, the logic is not consistent when `make_current` is `None`, as it also raises the same error even though the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current` is `None`, we should only invoke `self.make_current()` if an `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the `initialize` function ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. It also correctly handles the case when `make_current` is `None` by checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before calling `self.make_current()`. This should address the issue raised on GitHub.
