### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` is designed to check if the current IOLoop exists and if not to make it current.
- There are two conditions to consider:
  1. If `make_current` is `None`, it should create the current IOLoop if it doesn't exist.
  2. If `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current IOLoop.

### Errors
1. In the condition `elif make_current`, checking if `make_current` is `True`. However, it should be checking if `make_current is not None`.
2. The logic inside the `elif make_current:` block is incorrect. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, it should raise an error, not if it is `None`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the logic inside the `initialize` function is incorrect. It incorrectly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop when the `make_current` parameter is provided, leading to a raised RuntimeError even when the current IOLoop exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Fix the condition checking in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current` is not `None`.
2. Update the logic inside the `elif` block to correctly check if the current IOLoop exists and raise an error accordingly.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is not None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the condition in the `initialize` function to compare `make_current` with `None` correctly and adjusting the logic inside the `elif` block, the bug should be fixed and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
