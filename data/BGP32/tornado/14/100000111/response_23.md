### Analysis
1. The function `initialize` in the file `ioloop.py` is expecting a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean value indicating whether the current IOLoop instance should be created.
2. There seems to be an issue with the logic in the function where it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists.
3. The GitHub issue mentions that the function raises a RuntimeError even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, which seems to be incorrect behavior.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The logic inside the if-else conditions checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the condition when checking if the current IOLoop instance exists. The function should only raise an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and `make_current` is True. However, the current implementation also raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which is not the expected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the function to only raise an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and `make_current` is True. If `make_current` is None, the function should proceed to create the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version of the function, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance`. Then, we adjust the if-else conditions to check for the expected scenarios i.e., if `make_current` is None, create the IOLoop instance only if `current_instance` is None. If `make_current` is True, raise an error only if `current_instance` is not None.
