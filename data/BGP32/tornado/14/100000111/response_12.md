## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function checks the `make_current` parameter and the current `IOLoop` instance to determine if it needs to be set as the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.
3. The issue is caused by the condition check where it raises an error even if `make_current` is `True` because `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is already set. Also, we need to address the case where `make_current` is not provided.


## Bug Fix
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` branch, we ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is already set. This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue as well.
