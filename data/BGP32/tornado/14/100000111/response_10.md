### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and create one if not. However, the bug seems to be in the condition check for `make_current`. The bug is related to the logic flow when `make_current` is `True`.

### Error Location
The error is likely in the `elif make_current:` part of the code, where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it's not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which seems to be incorrect based on the logic described in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Cause
The bug causes the function to incorrectly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, the function should continue and call `self.make_current()`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks when `make_current` is `True` to call `self.make_current()` regardless of the current state of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
