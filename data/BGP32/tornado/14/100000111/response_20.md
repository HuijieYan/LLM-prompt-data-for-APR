## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance exists and calls the `make_current` method. However, it has a bug where it always raises a `RuntimeError` even when an IOLoop instance does not exist. This behavior contradicts the expected output in the GitHub issue, which questions why a RuntimeError is raised when the IOLoop instance is None.

### Potential Error Locations
1. The logic for checking if an IOLoop instance exists.
2. Incorrect conditional statements for determining whether to raise an error or call `make_current`.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises due to incorrect logic in the conditional statements. The function should only raise a `RuntimeError` when an IOLoop instance already exists. However, the current implementation is raising an error even when an IOLoop instance is None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statements in the `initialize` function. The function should raise a `RuntimeError` only if an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is True. In all other cases, it should create a new IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
