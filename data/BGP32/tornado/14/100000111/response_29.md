### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to check whether the current `IOLoop` exists and then either create it or raise a `RuntimeError` if it already exists. The issue reported on GitHub questions why a `RuntimeError` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. If the condition is true and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError`, which seems incorrect based on the GitHub issue description.

### Bug Explanation
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the logic when checking if the `IOLoop` instance is `None`. The function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and `make_current` is `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug
1. Update the logic to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and `make_current` is `False`, indicating that the current `IOLoop` instance should not exist.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, do nothing if the `IOLoop` instance is already present.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop:
    # Assuming the IOLoop class structure for demonstration purposes

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By correcting the logic within the function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
