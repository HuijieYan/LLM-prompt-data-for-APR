## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, to create one. However, the current implementation is not correctly handling the condition when `make_current` is `True`. It is incorrectly checking if an IOLoop instance does not exist and then raising an error when it should not. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior described in the GitHub issue. 

## Bug Explanation
The bug arises from the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should create a new IOLoop instance even if one already exists, but the current implementation raises a `RuntimeError` when an existing IOLoop instance is found.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` without raising an error if an IOLoop instance already exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # If an IOLoop instance already exists and make_current is True, just return
            return
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current IOLoop instance in the `current_instance` variable to avoid multiple calls to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, we appropriately check whether to create a new IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current instance. If `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, we simply return without raising an error, as expected.
