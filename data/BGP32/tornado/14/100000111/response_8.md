### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` has a conditional logic issue where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` twice with different outcomes. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`. Based on the expected input and output values, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` when `make_current` is `True`. 

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect logic in the conditional statements based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The `raise RuntimeError` block is not being triggered correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the logic branch for handling the case where `make_current` is `True` is not correctly implemented. The function incorrectly proceeds to call `make_current` again even when it should raise a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic of the function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance` to avoid calling the method multiple times. Then, we adjust the conditional statements to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists. This corrected version should address the bug and satisfy the expected input/output values specified in the GitHub issue.
