### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function takes an optional parameter `make_current`.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current `IOLoop` instance is also `None`, then it calls `make_current`.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. The issue complains about line 252, where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then raises an error even if it is `None`.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before making it current. However, in some cases, it might not be possible to get the current instance before setting it.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the function checks for the current `IOLoop` instance before actually trying to set it as the current instance. This check should be done after attempting to set it.

### Strategy for Fixing:
1. First, attempt to set the IOLoop instance as the current instance.
2. Then, if `make_current` is `True`, check if the current instance is actually set, raising an error if it is not.

### Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
