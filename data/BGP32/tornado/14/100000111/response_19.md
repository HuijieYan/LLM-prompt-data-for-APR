The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance depending on the `make_current` parameter. There are a couple of potential issues causing the bug:

1. The condition `if make_current is None` only checks whether `make_current` is `None`, but it doesn't consider the case when it's `True`. It should be modified to `if make_current is None or make_current is True` to correctly handle both cases.
2. The current logic might result in `RuntimeError` being raised even when `make_current` is `True`, which is not intended.

To address these issues, the buggy function can be corrected as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With these modifications, the function will correctly check for both `None` and `True` values of `make_current` and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-`None` value.

This corrected version should resolve the GitHub issue mentioned and satisfy the expected input/output values.
