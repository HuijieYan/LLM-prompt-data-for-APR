### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` has conditional checks for the `make_current` parameter. It is expected to either call `make_current()` if `make_current` is None or raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Error Location
The issue seems to be with the logic in the `elif make_current:` block. It should raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None. In this case, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` despite the `IOLoop` instance not actually existing.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If the `IOLoop` instance does not exist, `make_current()` should be called.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition in the `elif` block checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before raising the `RuntimeError`. This change ensures that the error is only raised when the `IOLoop` instance already exists.
