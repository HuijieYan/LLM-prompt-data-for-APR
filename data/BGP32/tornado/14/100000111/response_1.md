The buggy function provided is `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function has an issue where it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The code attempts to verify the absence of the current event loop incorrectly.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, leading to incorrect behavior when determining whether to make the current instance or raise an error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the way the function handles the `make_current` argument. When `make_current` is `True`, it should only attempt to make the instance current if there is no current event loop. However, the existing check for the current event loop instance is not handling this condition correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic around checking the current event loop instance to correctly determine if an instance already exists. We should only raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current event loop.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, and the current event loop instance already exists, addressing the issue reported on GitHub.
