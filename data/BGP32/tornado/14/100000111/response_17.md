### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` has conditional logic to check if the `make_current` parameter is None or True. There seems to be an issue in the logic flow where the RuntimeError is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, which contradicts the expected behavior specified in the issue on GitHub.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the if statement that raises a RuntimeError when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, which is contradictory to the expected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the current logic checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, and when it does, it incorrectly raises a RuntimeError. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior based on the GitHub issue description.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic to raise the RuntimeError only when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. For the case where `make_current` is None, we should simply call `self.make_current()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the changes outlined above, we ensure that the function behaves according to the expected input/output values and resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to line 252 in `tornado/ioloop.py`.
