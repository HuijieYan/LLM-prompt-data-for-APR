## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance, and it has a conditional logic to handle the `make_current` parameter. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights a problem where it is raising a RuntimeError despite the condition not being met. This suggests that the logic inside the function is not behaving as expected.

#### Error Location
The error seems to be occurring in the `initialize` function when checking for the current IOLoop instance and whether it already exists. The condition for raising the RuntimeError may not be correctly evaluating the current IOLoop state.

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely due to the incorrect evaluation of the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` before raising the RuntimeError. It seems like the logic is incorrectly structured, leading to the RuntimeError being raised in situations where it should not.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conditions for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance are correctly evaluated. This may involve adjusting the conditional statements and logic within the `initialize` function.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I have stored the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` to avoid calling the function multiple times. I have also adjusted the conditional statements to correctly check if the current IOLoop instance exists or not before making any decisions. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
