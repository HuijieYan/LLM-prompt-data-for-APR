### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is checking the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to determine if a current instance already exists.
- The function is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument provided.
- The issue on GitHub highlights confusion around the logic at line 252 which raises an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
- Line 252 where the error is raised based on the condition check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises due to the confusion in the logic of the `initialize` function. 
- The intention seems to be to only raise an error if `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the current implementation raises an error if `make_current` is True even when the current instance is None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
- Ensure that the error is not raised if `make_current` is False or None, regardless of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current or (make_current is None and current_instance is None):
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The function first checks the current `IOLoop` instance and stores it in `current_instance`.
- The error is only raised if `make_current` is True and there is an existing current instance.
- If `make_current` is None and there is no current instance, it sets the current `IOLoop`.
- If `make_current` is False, it does not try to set the current `IOLoop`.
