### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization logic for the `IOLoop` object.
- The function checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and whether to make the current instance.
- The bug seems to be related to the logic when `make_current` is `None`, which is causing the error message to be raised incorrectly.

### Identified Error Location:
- The issue seems to be in the logic block where `make_current` is `None`.
- If `make_current` is `None`, it checks whether there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it attempts to make the current instance. However, the error message is being raised even when there is no current instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the condition `if make_current is None` checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it tries to make the current instance. This logic seems fine.
- However, the bug arises when it tries to raise an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, which conflicts with the intention of the condition.
- In the buggy code, if `make_current` is `None` and there is a current instance of `IOLoop`, it should not raise an error as it is trying to make the current instance anyway.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the `initialize` function so that when `make_current` is `None`, it only attempts to make the current instance if there is no current instance already. No error should be raised in this case.
- When `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, the function should raise an error only if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function in the IOLoop class

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
```

### Summary:
- The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class has been resolved by updating the logic to properly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None` or `True`. This corrected version should address the issue posted on GitHub.
