### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None and then trying to make it the current instance if `make_current` is True. However, in the `elif make_current` block, it is also checking if the current instance is None, which contradicts the previous condition and can lead to the RuntimeError being raised when it shouldn't be.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue likely lies in the `elif make_current` block where there is a redundant check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is that the `elif make_current` block should only check if `make_current` is True and then make the current instance. There is no need to check if the current instance is None again in that block.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should remove the redundant check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in the `elif make_current` block. Instead, we should only check if `make_current` is True and proceed to make the current instance without checking for the current instance existence again.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the redundant check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in the `elif make_current` block has been replaced with `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`. This change ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised when the current instance already exists and the `make_current` flag is True.
