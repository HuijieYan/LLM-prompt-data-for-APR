### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is checking if an instance of `IOLoop` is already set as the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If `make_current` is not provided, it tries to set the current instance of `IOLoop` using `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises an error if there is already a current instance.
- The GitHub issue suggests confusion about the logic of the code at line 252, where it checks if the current instance is `None` but still raises an error "already exists". This indicates a potential issue with the logic of the function.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and then proceeds to check for `make_current` conditions.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug might be related to the logic flow in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is not provided and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it should set the current instance without raising an error. The error is raised only when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

### Suggested fix strategy:
- We should modify the `initialize` function to set the current instance if `make_current` is not provided and there is no current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, then raise an error only if a current instance already exists.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
