### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks the `make_current` argument and calls `make_current` if needed. However, there seems to be an issue with the conditional statements that determine whether to raise an error or not.

### Identified potential error locations:
1. The `if` condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. 
2. The logic to raise an error if `make_current` is `True` but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance seems to be incorrect.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is `True`, the current `IOLoop` instance should already exist and trying to set it as the current instance again should raise an error. However, the logic in the `initialize` function is not handling this scenario correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Update the conditional statements to ensure that the error is raised only when necessary and the current `IOLoop` instance is handled appropriately.

### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in a variable `current_instance` for easier access. Then, we update the conditional statements to address the bug where an error was being raised incorrectly. The correct logic now ensures that the `make_current` parameter is handled appropriately based on the current state of the `IOLoop` instance.
