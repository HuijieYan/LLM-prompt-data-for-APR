### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not before deciding to make it the current instance or raising an error.
- The GitHub issue points out the confusion with line 252, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None` and then raises an error for "already exists".

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `if make_current is None` block, the logic can lead to setting the current `IOLoop` instance even if it already exists.
2. The error is raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` in the `elif make_current` block which might not be the expected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug seems to stem from the unclear logic in the `initialize` function where it is trying to handle the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We should modify the logic to correctly handle the scenario where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and avoid setting it again.
- Clarify the checking of the current `IOLoop` instance and the condition for raising the error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic as shown above, we first check the current `IOLoop` instance outside of any conditions. Then, we handle the setting of the current instance or raising an error based on the `make_current` argument. This should resolve the confusion and potential bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
