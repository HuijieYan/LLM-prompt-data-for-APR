### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is within the `IOLoop` class in the `ioloop.py` file of the `tornado` library.
- The function is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance.
- The issue mentioned in GitHub focuses on the inconsistency in the logic of the `initialize` function at line 252 regarding the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` condition check.

### Potential Error Locations:
- There seems to be a logical error in the `initialize` function's handling of the `make_current` parameter and checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
- Specifically, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` might be causing confusion.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug arises from the fact that the `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` twice inconsistently.
- When `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current instance is `None` and makes itself current. But when `make_current` is provided with value `True`, it again checks if the current instance is `None` and raises an error if there is already an existing instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should:
- Correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` without duplicating the logic of checking for the current instance.
- Remove the redundant check for the current instance in the `make_current` path.
- Simplify the logic to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly sets the current `IOLoop` instance if needed and handles the case when an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

### Explanation of Correction:
- In the corrected version, we first retrieve the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
- We then check the `make_current` parameter:
   - If `make_current` is `None`, we check if there is no current instance and make the current instance if needed.
   - If `make_current` is `True`, we only check if there is an existing instance and raise an error if so. We then make the current instance if everything is in order.

This corrected version simplifies the logic and ensures consistent checking of the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
