### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking the current instance of `IOLoop` and then trying to make it current based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion over why a `RuntimeError` is being raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` and making it current based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. Handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking whether an instance of `IOLoop` already exists before making the current one. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should only check and make current if an instance already exists. However, the logic is flawed and does not handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the logic to check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing instance of `IOLoop` before making it current.
2. If `make_current` is `True` but there is no existing instance of `IOLoop`, then handle this scenario appropriately without raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check the `current_instance` of `IOLoop`. Then based on the value of `make_current`, we proceed to either make the current instance or raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
