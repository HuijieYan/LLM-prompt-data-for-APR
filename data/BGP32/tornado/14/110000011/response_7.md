### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current instance of `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` argument passed to it. The issue reported on GitHub highlights the confusion around the logic implemented in this function, specifically on line 252 where it checks for the current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic in the `initialize` function that checks for the current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. The handling of the `make_current` argument.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug lies in the conditional statements within the `initialize` function. The issue arises when `make_current` is `None`, and the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it attempts to make the current instance, which leads to confusion when it later checks for the current instance again and raises an error if it's not `None`. This inconsistency causes the bug reported on GitHub.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we should simplify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` argument. We can ensure that if `make_current` is `None`, it only attempts to make the current instance if one does not already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it should forcefully make the current instance and raise an error only if an instance already exists. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in a variable for better readability. Then, we handle the logic based on the `make_current` argument as explained in the strategy section. This should resolve the bug reported on GitHub by ensuring consistent behavior based on the `make_current` argument.
