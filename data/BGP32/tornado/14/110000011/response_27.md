### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and then trying to make the current instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The issue mentioned on GitHub is regarding the inconsistency in the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Error locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being checked regardless of the value of `make_current`.
2. The logic for handling `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop` is flawed.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `None`, the code checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop`, and if there isn't one, it tries to make the current instance without checking if `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`. This inconsistency leads to the issue reported on GitHub.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check the value of `make_current` before checking for the current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. Make the logic consistent for handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current:
                if current_instance is not None:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
                self.make_current()
```

By correcting the function as shown above, we ensure that the logic for checking the current instance of `IOLoop` is consistent with the value of the `make_current` parameter. This should address the issue reported on GitHub.
