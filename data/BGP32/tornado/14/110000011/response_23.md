### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado` library is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue reported on GitHub points out that there is confusion on line 252 related to the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent error message "current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `initialize` function on lines 252-255 where the logic is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is not handling the situation correctly. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, then it should make the current instance. However, by raising an error when `make_current` is `True`, it contradicts the earlier condition and causes confusion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be revised to handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True` properly. The error message should only be raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
        import errno
        import functools
        import tornado.ioloop
        import socket
    
        def connection_ready(sock, fd, events):
            while True:
                try:
                    connection, address = sock.accept()
                except socket.error as e:
                    if e.args[0] not in (errno.EWOULDBLOCK, errno.EAGAIN):
                        raise
                    return
                connection.setblocking(0)
                handle_connection(connection, address)
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)
    
            io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
            callback = functools.partial(connection_ready, sock)
            io_loop.add_handler(sock.fileno(), callback, io_loop.READ)
            io_loop.start()
    
    .. testoutput::
       :hide:
    
    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.
    """


    # The corrected initialize function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the `initialize` function now properly handles the cases where `make_current` is `None` or `True` and ensures that the error message is raised only in the appropriate scenario.
