### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before making the current loop. The issue reported on GitHub questions why the code raises a `RuntimeError` for "current IOLoop already exists" even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. This indicates a potential bug in the logic of the function when handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Error Location:
The potential error lies in the condition where the `make_current` parameter is `None` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`. The logic needs to ensure that the appropriate checks are made before raising an exception.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the logic to check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The condition that raises the `RuntimeError` is not correctly verifying the state of the current instance, leading to the confusion reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. We should only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, we should set the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In this corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `existing_instance` to avoid redundant calls. Then, we check if `make_current` is `None` and `existing_instance` is `None`, in which case we call `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if `existing_instance` is not `None` to raise the exception. Otherwise, we make the current loop.
