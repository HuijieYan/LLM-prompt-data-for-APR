### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` checks the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, the function calls `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance and then calls `make_current`. However, the current logic is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, it incorrectly raises an error.

### Identified potential error:
The potential error in the buggy function is the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter being `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. It should only raise an error if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` incorrectly. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current instance and raises an error, which is not the intended behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the logic to check if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, then call `make_current`.
- If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, then raise an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, and only raise an error if there is already a current instance.
