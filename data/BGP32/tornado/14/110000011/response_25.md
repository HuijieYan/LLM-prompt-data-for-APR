### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking the current status of the `IOLoop` instance and attempting to make it the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug seems to be related to the logic of checking if the current instance exists or not.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Comparison of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `None`.
2. Error message inconsistency when checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug is the inconsistency in the logic of checking the current `IOLoop` instance. The function checks if the instance is `None`, and if it is, it attempts to make it the current instance. However, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it again checks if the `IOLoop` instance is `None` before raising an error. This logic is contradictory and leads to confusion.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the checks for the current instance are consistent and the error message is appropriate based on the condition. Additionally, we need to make sure that the `make_current` behavior is handled correctly to avoid raising errors unnecessarily.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Changes Made:
1. Assigned `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `current_instance` for better readability and avoid repeated function calls.
2. Fixed the condition for checking if the `IOLoop` instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`.
3. Updated the error message to be more contextually accurate based on the condition.

By making these changes, the function now checks for the current instance consistently and raises an error only when necessary.
