### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class is `initialize()`, which is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue reported on GitHub points out that on line 252, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, but then raises an error indicating that it already exists. This discrepancy in logic needs to be addressed.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the following section of the code:
```python
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize()` function is contradictory. If `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is `None`, it should attempt to set the IOLoop instance as current. However, the error message being raised indicates that the IOLoop already exists, which is misleading.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve this issue, we should update the logic in the `initialize()` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance does not exist. Instead of raising an error, it should proceed to make the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # other class definitions
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # Previously it checked for None and raised an error, now checking for not None
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when `make_current` is True, the bug is fixed. This corrected version should align the behavior with the intended functionality.
