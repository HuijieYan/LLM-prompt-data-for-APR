### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current instance as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is set to `True`. If `make_current` is not specified, it will become the current `IOLoop` if no current instance exists. However, there seems to be a logical error in the implementation based on the error message from the GitHub issue.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` before deciding to make the current instance. The issue raised on GitHub indicates that there might be an inconsistency in handling the conditions.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` to determine whether it should make the current instance current. However, if `make_current` is set to `True`, it raises an error even if the current instance is already present.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that if `make_current` is set to `True`, it only raises an error if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. If a current instance already exists, it should not raise an error and proceed to make the current instance current.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # Current instance already exists, do not raise an error
            pass
```

This corrected version ensures that if `make_current` is set to `True`, it will only raise an error if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. Otherwise, it will proceed without raising an error.
