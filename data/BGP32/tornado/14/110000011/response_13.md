### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue on GitHub points out a confusion regarding the logic in the function when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Missing implementation for the `make_current` method.
2. Logic issue in the conditional statements within the `initialize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the confusion in the logic of the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, the code incorrectly tries to call `self.make_current()` which is not implemented. This leads to the error message "current IOLoop already exists" being raised, causing confusion.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Ensure the implementation of the `make_current` method is appropriate to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Update the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `None` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    # Constructor and other methods omitted for brevity
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version:
- The `current_instance` variable is used to store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` for reuse.
- The conditional statements are updated to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handle the logic based on the value of `make_current`.

By making these changes, the bug in the `initialize` function should be resolved, and the confusion pointed out in the GitHub issue should be addressed.
