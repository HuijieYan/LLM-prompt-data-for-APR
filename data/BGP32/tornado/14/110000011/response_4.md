### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` argument is `None`, then it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance available. If there is no current instance and `make_current` is `True`, it makes the current `IOLoop`. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is `None`, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it still calls `self.make_current()` which is unnecessary.

### Identified Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `initialize` function where the logic for handling `make_current=None` case is incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `None`, the code checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and then proceeds to call `self.make_current()`. This results in trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance when it is not necessary, leading to the misinterpretation of the "already exists" error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should only call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. If `make_current` is `None`, we should only check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance without trying to make it the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True`, then we check for the current `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance. If `make_current` is `None`, we only check if there is no current instance, in which case we make the current instance.
