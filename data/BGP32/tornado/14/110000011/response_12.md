### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs in the logic related to checking the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if it already exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Checking the current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` may not return the expected result.
2. The logic for raising an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the current `IOLoop` instance check. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, but it may not always return the correct result. This leads to inconsistencies in the behavior of raising an error when attempting to set a current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance is accurate. Additionally, the condition for raising an error when `make_current=True` needs to be reviewed and adjusted if necessary. Error handling should also be improved to provide clear and consistent messaging.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_ioloop` to ensure consistent usage.
2. We update the conditions to correctly handle scenarios where `make_current` is not specified or is `True`.
3. We adjust the check for the current `IOLoop` instance and the error-raising condition to ensure correctness.

By applying these changes, the bug related to incorrectly handling the current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error should be resolved.
