### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to check if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and make the current `IOLoop` if needed. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the logic of the function at line 252 where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists", which seems contradictory.

### Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `None` and the condition checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, meaning there is no current `IOLoop`, but then it raises an error about the current `IOLoop` already existing. This behavior is incorrect and leads to confusion.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by an incorrect handling of the logic in the `initialize` function. The logic flow is inconsistent with the error message that is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition where the error is raised. We should ensure that the error is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `False`, no error should be raised.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I have modified the condition when `make_current` is `True` to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising an error. This way, the error will only be raised if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is set to `True`.
