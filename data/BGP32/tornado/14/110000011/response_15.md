### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion over the behavior of the function when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. The bug seems to lie in the logic of how the current `IOLoop` instance is handled based on the `make_current` argument.

### Identified Potential Errors:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
2. The logic inside the `elif make_current` condition may not properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the logic in the `initialize` function when handling the `make_current` argument. If the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` according to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, the code tries to make it current even if `make_current` is `None`. This contradicts the intended behavior if no `IOLoop` instance currently exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. We should only try to make it current if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, and raise an error if an instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current_instance is None:
        if make_current is not False:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

In the corrected version:
- We store the current `IOLoop` instance result in `current_instance` variable for better readability.
- We check if `current_instance` is `None` and if `make_current` is not explicitly set to `False`, then we make the current instance.
- We explicitly check if `make_current` is `True` and an instance exists which will raise an error as required.

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide the desired behavior for the `initialize` function.
