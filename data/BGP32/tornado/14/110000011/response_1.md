### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class is the `initialize` method, which is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The issue reported on GitHub indicates confusion regarding the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Checking `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` for `None` value.
2. Incorrectly handling the case where `make_current` is True but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` method is called with `make_current=True`, but there is no current `IOLoop` instance (`IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`). In this case, instead of setting the current instance, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` method to handle the case where `make_current` is True, but there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. We should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Previous class code remains unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the `initialize` method, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` before checking the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is True and there is no current instance, we set the current instance. If `make_current` is True but there is already a current instance, we correctly raise a `RuntimeError`.
