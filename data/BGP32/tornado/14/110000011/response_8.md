### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` argument is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there isn't, it makes the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks again if there is already a current instance and raises an error if it does.

### Identified Bug:
- The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is `None`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Even though there is a current instance, the function proceeds with `self.make_current()`, which should only happen when `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug is caused by a logical error in the conditional statements. The logic of checking for existing `IOLoop` instance should only trigger when `make_current` is `None`, not when it is `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to ensure that the check for existing `IOLoop` instance happens only when `make_current` is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is False:  # Change made here
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change made here
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is only performed when `make_current` is `False`. If there is already a current instance in this case, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
