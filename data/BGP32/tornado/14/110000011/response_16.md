### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and sets itself as the current instance if not.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub points out that on line 252, the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, but the code is still raising a `RuntimeError` indicating "current IOLoop already exists". This behavior is incorrect and needs to be fixed.

### Identification of potential error location:
- The potential error location is within the condition where `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. In this scenario, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the logic in the if condition does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. The code should only raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- We need to modify the if condition for the case when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should only set the `IOLoop` instance as current if there is no existing current instance. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class declarations...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the suggested correction in the code snippet above, the issue mentioned on GitHub will be resolved.
