### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None or not before potentially making it the current instance.
- The issue on GitHub highlights that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, but the code still raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

### Identified Potential Error:
- The code is checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance but is not handling the case where it is actually None.
- The logic to handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None is missing.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because even if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, the code still proceeds to raise a `RuntimeError` assuming that the current instance exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to add a condition to handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, instead of raising an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class components...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in a variable `current_instance` and then handle the scenario where this instance is None appropriately. The bug is fixed by making sure not to raise an error when the current instance is None.
