### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and then checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it tries to make the current instance.
- The issue on GitHub points out a discrepancy where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is evaluated as `None`, but then a RuntimeError is raised stating "current IOLoop already exists".

### Identified Error:
- The error occurs when the condition `if make_current is None` is met, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is evaluated as `None`. The function then tries to make the current instance, which is not consistent with the logic of checking for the existence of a current instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function is not properly handling the case where `make_current` is None and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. It attempts to make the current instance in this scenario, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is None and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. It should only attempt to make the current instance if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
- In the corrected version of the `initialize` function, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable for better readability.
- We then check if `make_current` is `None`, and if there is no current instance, we proceed to make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True`, we explicitly check for the existence of a current instance and raise a RuntimeError if it already exists. Otherwise, we make the current instance.

By following this corrected logic, we ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as intended and does not incorrectly trigger the RuntimeError in the scenario highlighted in the GitHub issue.
