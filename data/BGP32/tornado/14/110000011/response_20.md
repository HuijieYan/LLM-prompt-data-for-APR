### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, if there is already a current `IOLoop`, and then trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The issue reported on GitHub questions the logic at line 252 where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, but still raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists".
- The issue seems to be related to the confusion in the logic of checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Identified Error Location:
- The issue seems to stem from the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` at line 252.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs due to the misleading logic in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
- When `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, indicating that there is no current instance, the code incorrectly raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists".

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- The logic should be modified to check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. If there is already a current instance, an error should be raised.
- Additionally, the check for the `make_current` parameter being `None` can be simplified by directly calling `self.make_current()`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `initialize` function now correctly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter and raises an error only when necessary.
