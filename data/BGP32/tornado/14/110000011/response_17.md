### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking whether there is already a current `IOLoop` instance or not based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The issue reported on GitHub is questioning the logic on line 252 where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` but then raises an exception saying "current IOLoop already exists".

### Error Location:
The error is in the logic where it checks the current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if it is not `None`, it raises an error saying it already exists. However, the condition for this error seems to be incorrect as it should only raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic to raise an error only if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `None` or `False`, then it should set the current instance without raising an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance in a variable for better readability. Then, we adjust the conditions to check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and implement the logic accordingly. Now, the error will only be raised if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
