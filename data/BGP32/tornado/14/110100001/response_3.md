### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` if `make_current=True` and there is currently no active `IOLoop` instance. However, the function is not handling the case where `make_current=True` but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Identification:
The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In such cases, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` only if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by incorrectly checking if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this modification, the function will now correctly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance the current one. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
