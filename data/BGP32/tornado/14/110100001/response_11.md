The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is related to the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue arises when trying to force the current instance using the `make_current=True` flag.

The buggy function first checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current instance is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, in the case where `make_current=True`, it checks if the current instance is `None` again, which should not trigger an error since we are explicitly trying to force the current instance.

To fix the bug, we can remove the redundant check in the `initialize` function when `make_current=True`. The logic should be simplified to simply call `self.make_current()` in that case.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should work correctly and pass the failing test provided.
