### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by making it the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the current implementation has a bug where it incorrectly checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before making itself the current instance.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is in the condition where it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before making itself the current instance. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect and does not correctly determine if an instance exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly handle the case when trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The condition for checking if the current instance exists needs to be corrected to accurately determine if there is an existing `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, the logic of making the current instance should be adjusted accordingly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is True:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=True)
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists.")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=True)
        if not current_instance:
            self.make_current()
```

After fixing the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class, the provided failing test `test_force_current` should pass without raising any `RuntimeError` exceptions.
