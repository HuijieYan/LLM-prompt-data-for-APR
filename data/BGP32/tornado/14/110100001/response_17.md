The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. It should raise a `RuntimeError` in this case, but instead, it checks if there is no current instance and then tries to make itself current. This results in the incorrect behavior when trying to force the current `IOLoop`.

To fix this bug, we need to restructure the logic in the `initialize` function to check if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, in which case it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected. This will make the failing test case `test_force_current` pass.
