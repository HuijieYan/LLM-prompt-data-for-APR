### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, including setting it as the current instance.
2. The bug lies in the `initialize` function where the logic for checking the current instance and making it the current instance is flawed.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then attempts to create another one which should fail with a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current one.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the logic to properly check for the current instance, the bug is resolved. Now the `initialize` function will correctly handle setting the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
