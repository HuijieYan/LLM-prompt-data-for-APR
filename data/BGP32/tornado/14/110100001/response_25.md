## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current instance.

## Identifying the Bug
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition where `make_current` is set to `True`. The function checks if there is already a current instance and throws an error if so, even though it should only do this check when `make_current` is `False`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter within the `initialize` function. The logic is flipped, resulting in the function incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function. Specifically, we should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance. If `make_current` is not specified or `False`, then we should make the current instance without any check.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class code here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustments as shown above, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
