### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument passed.
- The bug lies in the logic where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not, which is causing the test case `test_force_current()` to fail.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not.
2. The logic to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `initialize` of the `IOLoop` class does not correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This discrepancy causes the `RuntimeError` to not be raised as expected in the failing test case.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This will ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised when required.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the logic to check if the current instance is not `self` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the test case `test_force_current()` will pass successfully.
