## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then trying to make it the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the logic inside the function is incorrect.

## Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of the `initialize` function. It is incorrectly checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then trying to make it the current `IOLoop` instance or raising an error. This logic does not correctly handle the case for `make_current=True`.

## Fix:
We need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`. We should first check if `make_current` is True, and if so, always try to make the current `IOLoop` instance without checking for its existence.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            self.make_current()
```

After making this change, the corrected `initialize` function should correctly make the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, passing the failing test case provided.
