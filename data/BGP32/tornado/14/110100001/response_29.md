The issue in the `initialize` function is that it is not setting the current `IOLoop` instance correctly when `make_current=True` is passed. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect because it should check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance already.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `initialize` function needs to be updated as follows:

```python
# Corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` when `make_current=True`, the function should now correctly handle the case when a current instance already exists and raise the `RuntimeError` accordingly.

After applying this fix, the provided failing test should pass without any issues.
