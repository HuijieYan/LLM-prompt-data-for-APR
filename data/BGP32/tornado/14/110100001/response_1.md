### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current instance already exists and then either sets the instance as current or raises an error.
2. The potential error locations in the `initialize` function are the conditions where it checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create two instances of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, expecting an error on the second instance creation.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        # Check if current instance already exists
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()    
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
