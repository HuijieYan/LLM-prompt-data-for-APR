## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current instance of the `IOLoop` if `make_current` is True and there is no existing current instance. However, the current implementation has some logical issues which are causing it to fail the test.

## Identified issue:
The issue lies in the conditional checks inside the `initialize` function. The logic is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. This leads to the test case failing when it shouldn't.

## Bug cause:
- When `make_current` is True and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the current implementation is not handling this case properly.
- The logic to check for an existing current instance is incorrect and does not align with the intended behavior.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.
- Ensure that the function raises a `RuntimeError` in this case and only sets the current instance if `make_current` is True and there is no existing current instance.

## Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the above corrected version of the `initialize` function, it should now pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
