The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical error in handling the `make_current` argument. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The function is incorrectly checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which is causing the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance before attempting to make the current instance. If there is already a current instance in this case, we should raise an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the `make_current` argument properly and pass the failing test.
