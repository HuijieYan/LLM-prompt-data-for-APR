The issue in the `initialize` function is that the `make_current()` method is being called incorrectly. The `initialize` function should only set the `make_current` attribute of the `IOLoop` instance, and then the `make_current()` method should be called separately.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly set the `make_current` attribute, and then call `make_current()` if needed.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly set the `make_current` attribute of the `IOLoop` instance and call the `make_current()` method when needed.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
