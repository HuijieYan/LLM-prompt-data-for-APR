### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and if not, setting the current instance to the newly created one.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, causing the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if a current instance already exists, which is not happening correctly in the buggy function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks if `make_current` is `True` to only raise the `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists, rather than raising it as soon as `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, it should now properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
