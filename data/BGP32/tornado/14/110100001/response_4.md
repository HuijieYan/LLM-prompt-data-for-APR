### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is specified. However, there are issues with how the current instance is being checked and set in the `initialize` function.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Checking the current instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` might not return the expected result.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for the current instance and the flawed logic for handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when it should not in certain cases.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check the current instance, the `instance` argument should be removed.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter should be revised to properly set the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections, the buggy function should now work correctly and pass the failing test for the `IOLoop` class.
