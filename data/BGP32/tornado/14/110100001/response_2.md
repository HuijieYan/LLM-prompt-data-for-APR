## Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then trying to make the current instance. However, the logic is incorrect and not handling the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The problem lies in the conditional statements within the `initialize` function where it should correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is an existing current instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to become the current instance. However, the test also checks for an exception to be raised if a second attempt is made to create a current `IOLoop`. This test is failing because the existing logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling this scenario.
4. To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be modified to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance by raising an exception as expected in the failing test.

## Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic to check if `self.current` instead of `IOLoop.current`, we can accurately determine if there is already a current instance before attempting to make a new instance current. This change ensures that the behavior aligns with the expectations of the failing test.
