The bug in the `initialize` function occurs because the logic to check if the current IOLoop instance exists is incorrect. The function is supposed to ensure that if `make_current=True`, it raises an error if there is already a current instance. However, the current logic is flawed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function. We should first check if `make_current=True` and if there is already a current instance. If both conditions are met, we should raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we should proceed with setting the current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This updated version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test provided.
