1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for ensuring that the current `IOLoop` instance is set correctly based on the `make_current` argument. It checks if a current instance exists and if not, sets the current instance.

2. The potential error location in the `initialize` function is the logic used to handle the `make_current` argument.

3. The cause of the bug is that the logic to handle the `make_current` argument is not correctly setting the current instance when `make_current=True`. This is evident from the failing test `test_force_current` where it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised but the current instance is not being set correctly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making sure that we set the current instance only when it does not already exist (if `make_current=None`) and explicitly checking if current instance exists or not before setting it (if `make_current=True`), we can fix the bug in the `initialize` function.
