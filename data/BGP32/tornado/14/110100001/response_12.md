The issue in the `initialize` function arises from the logic that checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make the current `IOLoop`. The problem occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument, but there is no current `IOLoop` instance present. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` as specified in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` is passed and no current `IOLoop` instance exists. The function should raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test provided.
