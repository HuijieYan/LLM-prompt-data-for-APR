### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` after already setting `make_current=True` for an existing instance.

### Potential Error Location:
One potential error location is the conditional statements inside the `initialize` function where it checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current and whether to make the new instance current.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is set for multiple instances. It only checks for the existence of a current instance once, but does not account for the case where a new instance is created with `make_current=True` after an existing instance has already been made current.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the scenario where multiple instances are created with `make_current=True`. We should modify the conditional statements to correctly handle making an instance current only when necessary, and raising an error when attempting to make an instance current if another instance is already current.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should now handle the `make_current` argument correctly and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
