The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. The current logic checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, but it does not handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.

The `initialize` function should ensure that the `IOLoop` instance is not made current if `make_current` is explicitly set to `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `make_current` is set to `False`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        # if make_current is False, do not make the current IOLoop
        pass
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case when `make_current` is set to `False`, ensuring that the `IOLoop` instance is not made current in that scenario. This change should allow the `test_force_current` test to pass successfully.
