The issue with the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is that it is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` incorrectly. The `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method is used to retrieve the current instance of the `IOLoop` class, but the `instance=False` argument is not valid. The correct way to check for the current instance is simply `IOLoop.current()`. 

Additionally, the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter is not working as intended. If `make_current` is `None`, it should only make the current instance if there isn't one already. If `make_current` is `True`, it should always try to make the current instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the way the current instance is checked and adjust the logic for making the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current()
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first retrieve the current instance using `IOLoop.current()` without any arguments. Then we check the `make_current` parameter and handle the logic accordingly to set the current instance or raise an error if needed.
