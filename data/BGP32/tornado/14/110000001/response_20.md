## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` argument is `None`, and if so, it tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance current. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if it does. However, the `self.make_current()` method is not correctly handling the instance creation.

## Potential Errors:
1. The call to `self.make_current()` within the `initialize` function may not be correctly handling the creation of the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Cause of Bug:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of setting the current `IOLoop` instance within the `initialize` function. The logic for making the current instance is not properly implemented.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
We need to ensure that the `make_current()` method correctly sets the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` or `None`. Additionally, the logic for checking if the current instance already exists needs to be adjusted.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to avoid calling it multiple times. Then, we check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current instance to correctly handle setting the current `IOLoop` instance. Update the function with this corrected version to address the bug.
