The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug where the `make_current` method is referenced without belonging to the object context. To fix this bug, we need to use `self.make_current()` instead of simply `make_current()`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By using `self.make_current()` instead of `make_current()`, we ensure that the `make_current` method is called within the context of the object and the bug is fixed.
