The potential error in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class lies in the condition check for `make_current`. The current implementation checks if `make_current` is `None` and if `IOLoop.current` is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`. However, the logic is incorrect because it should call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True` and not None.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if `make_current` is `True` instead of `None` in the `if` block.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and will raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
