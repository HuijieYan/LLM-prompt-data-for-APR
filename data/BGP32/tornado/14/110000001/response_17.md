## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is attempting to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument. The function checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` and tries to make the instance current based on the value of `make_current`.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect usage of `self.make_current()` without a proper definition.
2. Incorrect condition check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the `initialize` function. The function is trying to make the `IOLoop` instance current without a proper definition of `make_current`. Additionally, the condition check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not the correct way to check for the current instance.

## Strategy to Fix the Bug:
1. Define the `make_current` function properly if needed.
2. Use the `IOLoop.current()` method with proper checking to determine the current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    ...
    
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
                self.current().make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.current().make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I have assumed that the `make_current` method is part of the `IOLoop` class and used `self.current().make_current()` to make the instance current. Additionally, I have used proper condition checks using `instance=True` to determine the current instance correctly.
