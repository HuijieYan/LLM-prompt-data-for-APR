The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class has two potential error locations:
1. The `self.make_current()` method call is missing the argument `instance=False`.
2. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be `if IOLoop.current() is None:`.

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to check the current `IOLoop` instance incorrectly by passing the argument `instance=False` within the `initialize` function.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the call to `self.make_current()` to include the argument `instance=False`.
2. Change the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current() is None:` to correctly check if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current(instance=False)
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current(instance=False)
```
