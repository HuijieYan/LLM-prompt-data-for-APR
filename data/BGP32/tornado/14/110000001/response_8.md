The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logical bug in the conditional check. The issue lies in the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is meant to check if there is already a current instance of the `IOLoop`. However, the condition logic is inverted, and it checks for non-existence instead.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logical check in both places where it occurs. We should check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists instead of checking if it is `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version will properly check if there is already a current instance of the `IOLoop` before making it the current one as intended.
