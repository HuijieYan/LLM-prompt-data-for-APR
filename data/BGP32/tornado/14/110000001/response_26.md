## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is attempting to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and set the `make_current` attribute accordingly.
- The buggy function uses the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method to check if a current instance exists.
- There is a potential bug in the condition where the `make_current` attribute is `True` but there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

## Identified Bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` attribute is `True`, but there is no current instance of `IOLoop`. In this case, the function should raise an error indicating that a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist before trying to set it as the current instance.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for when `make_current` is `True` to include a check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current instance, raise an error before attempting to set the current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is None:
                raise RuntimeError("Cannot make current, as no current IOLoop instance exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of `IOLoop` in a variable `current_instance`. When `make_current` is `True`, we check if `current_instance` is `None`, and if so, raise an error before setting the current instance. This ensures that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
