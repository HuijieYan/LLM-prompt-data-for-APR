The bug in the provided function `initialize` lies in the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. 

1. The function first checks if the `make_current` argument is `None`. If it is `None`, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance to the current object (self). However, it misses the method call to `make_current` in this scenario.
2. If the `make_current` argument is not `None` (either `True` or `False`), it should either set the current `IOLoop` instance to the current object (self) or raise an error if there is already a current instance. This logic seems correct.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `make_current` method is called when `make_current` is `None` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `make_current` method is called when needed, and the current `IOLoop` instance is properly set based on the `make_current` argument provided.
