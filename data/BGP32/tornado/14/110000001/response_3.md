### Analysis:
The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is trying to handle the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument passed into it. It checks if there is already a current instance and then either sets the current instance or raises an error based on the value of `make_current`.

### Error Location:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is incorrect and should be `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`
2. The condition `elif make_current` should be `elif make_current is True:` for more readability.

### Bug Explanation:
The first error location is causing the function to set the current instance even if there is already a current instance present. This goes against the logic of the condition to check if there is no current instance. The second error location is comparing the `make_current` argument directly without checking if it is True, leading to a possibility of misinterpretation.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the condition to check if there is a current instance (not None) instead of checking if it is None.
2. Explicitly check if `make_current` is True to improve readability and prevent any confusion.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the buggy function should now correctly handle the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument passed to it.
