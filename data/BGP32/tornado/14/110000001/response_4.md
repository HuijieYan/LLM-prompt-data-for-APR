## Analaysis:
- The `initialize` function is part of the `IOLoop` class.
- The purpose of the function is to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and control whether it becomes the current `IOLoop`.
- The function checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists and determines whether to make the instance current based on the `make_current` argument.

## Identified Errors:
- The first `if` condition checks if `make_current` is `None`, which should set the current `IOLoop` if one doesn't already exist. However, the `self.make_current()` function is called instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.
- The second `elif` condition checks if `make_current` is `True`, but the logic to check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not correct.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the incorrect function `self.make_current()` is being called instead of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
- The logic in the second condition is flawed, leading to incorrect behavior when determining whether to raise an error or set the current `IOLoop`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Correct the function call to `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` instead of `self.make_current()` in the first `if` condition.
- Revise the logic in the second condition to check the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance accurately and handle the `make_current` argument accordingly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            IOLoop.current().make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
