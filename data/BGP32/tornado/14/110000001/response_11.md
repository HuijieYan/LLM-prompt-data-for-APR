The potential error location in the buggy function is the conditional statement checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition is incorrect because `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` does not return None if no current instance exists.

The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the conditional statements. The intention of the `initialize` function is to set the current `IOLoop` instance, if `make_current` is True or if no current instance exists. However, the current logic does not account for all possible scenarios correctly.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the logic in the `initialize` function as follows:

1. If `make_current` is True, always set the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is False, only set the current instance if no current instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=True):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By simplifying the conditional statements and changing the logic to only set the current instance when necessary, we can fix the bug in the `initialize` function.
