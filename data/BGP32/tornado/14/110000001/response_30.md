## Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` argument is provided. However, the current implementation has a bug where it checks if the current instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method instead of `IOLoop.current()`. This incorrect usage might lead to unexpected behavior and could be the cause of the bug.

## Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the incorrect usage of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method to check for the current instance of `IOLoop`. This results in not properly checking for the current instance and can lead to errors in setting the current instance as intended.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we should use `IOLoop.current()` method without passing the `instance=False` argument to correctly check for the current instance of `IOLoop`. Additionally, the logic for setting the current instance based on the `make_current` argument should be updated to address the bug.

## Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current():
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current():
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have removed `instance=False` argument from `IOLoop.current()` calls and adjusted the logic based on the `make_current` argument as intended. This should fix the bug and ensure proper behavior in setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
