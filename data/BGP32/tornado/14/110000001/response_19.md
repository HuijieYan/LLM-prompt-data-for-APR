The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make it the current one. However, there seems to be a logical error in the `if` conditions which can lead to incorrect behavior.

The potential error locations are in the `if` conditions where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not.

The cause of the bug is that in the `if` conditions, it should be checking if an instance of `IOLoop` exists, but it is incorrectly checking for `instance=False`, which might not return the expected result.

To fix the bug, the `if` conditions should be modified to correctly check if an instance of `IOLoop` exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current():
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current():
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, `IOLoop.current()` is used to check if an instance of `IOLoop` exists, rather than using `instance=False`. This change ensures that the correct logic is applied for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
