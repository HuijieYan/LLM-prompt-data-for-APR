1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method within the `IOLoop` class. It is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance and potentially making it the current `IOLoop`.

2. The potential error location in the buggy function is the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` condition check. This condition is meant to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, however, the `instance=False` parameter is incorrectly used.

3. The cause of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `instance=False` parameter in the `IOLoop.current()` method call. The correct parameter to use is `instance=True` to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:`. This change will correctly check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and allow the function to proceed accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
