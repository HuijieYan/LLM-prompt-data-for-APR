The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is attempting to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current loop based on the `make_current` argument. There appears to be a bug in the logic of the function that may cause issues with setting the current instance of the `IOLoop` class. 

The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. In this case, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` as it tries to set a new current instance when one already exists. However, the existing logic in the function does not correctly handle this scenario. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, the function raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. 

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and an existing current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
