## Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists based on the `make_current` argument passed to it.
- If `make_current` is None, it checks if a current instance exists and makes the instance current if it does not.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current instance exists and raises an error if it does, otherwise it makes the instance current.

## Bugs:
- The bug lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` which should actually be `if self.current(instance=False) is None:` since it is referring to the current instance being initialized.

## Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly referring to `IOLoop.current` instead of `self.current` to check if a current instance exists. This causes the function to incorrectly handle the current instance logic.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Change the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `self.current(instance=False) is None`.
- This will correctly check if a current instance exists based on the instance being initialized.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
