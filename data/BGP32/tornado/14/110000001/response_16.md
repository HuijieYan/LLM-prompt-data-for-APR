### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there is a bug in the logic that is preventing the correct behavior.

### Identified Error:
The buggy function has a logical error in the condition when `make_current` is `None`. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then calls `self.make_current()`, which is incorrect. It should check if there is no current instance and then set itself as the current instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by mistakenly checking the current instance and then setting make_current without checking its value when make_current is None.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the condition when `make_current` is `None` to check if there is no current instance and then make the current instance.
- Update the logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `False`.
- Refactor the code for clarity and readability.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        else:
            # When make_current is False, do not make the current instance
            pass
```

In the corrected version:
- The logic in the condition for `make_current=None` is updated to check if there is no current instance before setting itself as the current instance.
- The logic for `make_current=True` is updated to check if a current instance already exists before setting itself as the current instance.
- Added a condition for `else` when `make_current` is `False` to skip making the current instance.
