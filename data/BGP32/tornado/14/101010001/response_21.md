### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The error occurs when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.
3. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised because a current IOLoop already exists.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function, where it incorrectly checks if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current` already exists, then raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current` does not exist, then proceed to call `self.make_current()`.
3. If `make_current` is `None`, continue with the existing logic to handle the case where `IOLoop.current` does not exist.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the logic inside the `initialize` function as described above, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
