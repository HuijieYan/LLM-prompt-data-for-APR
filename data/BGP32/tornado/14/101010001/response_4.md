### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly. It is throwing a `RuntimeError` even when the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. This suggests a logical error in the conditional statement.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the conditional statement `elif make_current:` where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should create the current `IOLoop` instance when it doesn't exist.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `elif make_current:` statement should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, the code is raising the error even when the current instance does not exist, leading to a faulty behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the `elif make_current:` condition to ensure that it only raises a `RuntimeError` when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists, it should create a new instance instead.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
