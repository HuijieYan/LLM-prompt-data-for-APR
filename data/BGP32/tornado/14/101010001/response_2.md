### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` within the `IOLoop` class.
- The error message indicates that the function is raising a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.
- The function checks the value of `make_current` and if it is `True`, it tries to set the current IOLoop which already exists, leading to the error.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the function tries to set the current IOLoop but does not check if the current IOLoop already exists. 
- This leads to the situation where an attempt is made to set a current IOLoop when it is already set, causing the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to only call `self.make_current()` if there is no current IOLoop set. 
- This can be achieved by first checking if the current IOLoop is not `None` before attempting to set the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By applying this correction, the function will now only try to make the current IOLoop if one is not already set when `make_current` is `True`, eliminating the `RuntimeError` caused by trying to set a current IOLoop that already exists.
