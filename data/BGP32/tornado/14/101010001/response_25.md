### Analysis:
1. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is set to `True` in the initialization of the IOLoop object.
2. The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If an instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, it raises a RuntimeError, even though the condition should allow creating a new instance.
3. The bug is caused by an incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function, where it is raising an error when a current IOLoop instance exists and `make_current` is `True`, contrary to the expected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance. Otherwise, it should create a new instance without raising an error.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `initialize` function from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, we ensure that a new IOLoop instance is only created when `make_current` is `True` and no instance currently exists.
