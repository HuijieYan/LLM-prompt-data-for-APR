## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if one already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. The error message indicates that the `current IOLoop` already exists when trying to force a new current `IOLoop`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect condition check when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The logic for handling the current `IOLoop` instance may be flawed.

## Bug Cause
When the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`, the buggy logic is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does, it raises an error without properly handling this scenario, which leads to the failure.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions in the class remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # If a current IOLoop instance already exists
                # Just returning without raising an error
                return
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, when `make_current` is `True`, if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it will simply return from the function instead of raising an error. This change ensures that the function does not raise an error when trying to make a new instance current but one already exists.
