## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object with a flag `make_current`, which controls whether the IOLoop object should be made the current object or not. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop object already exists.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if there is no current IOLoop object, which is incorrect when `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The `elif make_current:` block does not consider the case when `make_current` is `True`, which the bug is triggered.

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the existing code does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop object. This situation results in a `RuntimeError` being raised.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the scenario when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current IOLoop object already exists. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop object.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass. Now, when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current IOLoop object, as intended.
