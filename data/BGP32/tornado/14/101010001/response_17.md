1. The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class. The function checks if an IOLoop exists and if not, it will call `make_current` method. If a current IOLoop already exists, it will raise a `RuntimeError`. The failing test is trying to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, but the current IOLoop already exists according to the error message.

2. The potential error location is in the logic of checking if a current IOLoop already exists.

3. The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, it should raise an error. However, the buggy code is not handling this case properly and trying to create a new IOLoop instance without checking if one already exists.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is, we check if a current IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we proceed to call `make_current`. This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
