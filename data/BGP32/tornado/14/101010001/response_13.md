### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised because a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. The bug occurs because the condition to check if a current `IOLoop` already exists is not properly handled when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Modified the condition here
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version of the `initialize` function, the code should now handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. This fix ensures that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when attempting to create a new current `IOLoop` when one already exists.
