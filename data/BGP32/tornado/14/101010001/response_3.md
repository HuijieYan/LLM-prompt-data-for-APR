1. Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object with a specific configuration. The function checks if the `make_current` parameter is None, then checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if so, it makes the current instance. If the `make_current` parameter is True, it again checks if the current instance is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

2. Potential Error Locations:
The error is likely happening due to incorrect logic or condition checking in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class.

3. Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition checking in the else block of the `initialize` function. If `make_current` is True, it should rather check if the current IOLoop instance is not None before allowing it to be created. The current logic checks if it is None, which is contradictory to the intended behavior.

4. Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the condition check in the elif block should be reversed to ensure that the current IOLoop instance exists before raising an error. This way, the function will only create a new instance if none exists.

5. Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By reversing the condition in the elif block to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None, we ensure that a new instance is only created when there is no existing current instance. This corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
