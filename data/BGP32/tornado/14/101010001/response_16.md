### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class.
- This method checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` and either makes the current one or raises an error if one already exists.
- The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when trying to initialize a new IOLoop instance even though an existing one is already present.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists. The issue may lie in the logic around this condition.
- The logic for handling the case where `make_current` parameter is set to `True` might be incorrect.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function tries to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` even though there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. 
- This violates the logic of the function, which is designed to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and handle the initialization accordingly.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance is already present when `make_current=True`.
- We should adjust the condition to only raise an error if the existing `IOLoop` instance is not `None` and `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Adjusted condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

# The bug has been fixed by adjusting the condition to raise an error only when current IOLoop instance exists and make_current=True
```
