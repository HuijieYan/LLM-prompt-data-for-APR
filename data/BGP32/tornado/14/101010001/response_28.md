### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set up the IOLoop instance.
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True but an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The bug is related to the condition when `make_current` is True but an IOLoop instance already exists, leading to the RuntimeError.
4. We need to ensure that the `make_current` logic is only executed if an IOLoop instance does not already exist.
5. The bug can be fixed by adjusting the logic within the `initialize` function to check if an IOLoop instance exists before proceeding.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Check if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to make the current instance in the `initialize` function.
2. Adjust the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. Only call `self.make_current()` if an IOLoop instance does not already exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance.
