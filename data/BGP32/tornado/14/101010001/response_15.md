### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado` library.
2. The `initialize` function checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance already created. If not, it will either create one or raise an error based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but the error message indicates that it is raising a `RuntimeError` for an already existing `IOLoop`.

### Error Location:
The bug is within the conditional check when `make_current` is `None`. The `initialize` function should only set the current instance if there isn't one already, regardless of the value of `make_current`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the `initialize` function is checking for an existing `IOLoop` instance incorrectly. It should only create a new `IOLoop` instance when there isn't one, regardless of the `make_current` parameter.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug:
1. Update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to only create a new `IOLoop` instance if there isn't one already.
2. Remove the unnecessary conditional branch for the `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current instance already exists
            if make_current is not None and make_current:  # Always set current instance if it doesn't exist
                self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version simplifies the logic to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is only set if one does not already exist.
