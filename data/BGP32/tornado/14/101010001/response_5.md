### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance. It takes an optional argument `make_current`, which defaults to `None`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the function checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If there is one, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though `make_current` is explicitly set to create a new one.
3. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when trying to force a new instance using `make_current=True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, a new `IOLoop` instance is created regardless of the current state.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()  # Always create a new current instance
``` 

In the corrected version, when `make_current=True`, it will always create a new current instance of `IOLoop` without checking if one already exists. This modification ensures that a new `IOLoop` instance is created regardless of the current status.
