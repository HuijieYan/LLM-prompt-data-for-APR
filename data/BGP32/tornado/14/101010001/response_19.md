### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and if it doesn't, it creates a new one. If `make_current` is True, then it tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance even if one already exists, which is leading to the RuntimeError.
2. The error message is indicating that a `RuntimeError` is being raised because a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Location:
The bug lies in the `initialize` function where it is not properly handling the case where `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to only create a new `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and there isn't a current `IOLoop` instance already present. We should remove the condition where it raises a `RuntimeError` and simply exit the function if a current instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we removed the condition that raised the `RuntimeError` and instead just call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance does not already exist. This modification ensures that the function behaves correctly without raising an error in case of an existing instance.
