## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and make it the current one, or if not, create a new one.
2. The error message indicates that the error occurs when `make_current=True`, and the function is trying to make the IOLoop instance current even though an instance already exists.
3. The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to appropriately handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of IOLoop already exists. If yes, raise a specific error to indicate that the IOLoop instance already exists.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and no instance of IOLoop exists, then make the current instance the current one.
3. If `make_current` is `None`, then follow the current logic to create a new instance if needed.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the corrected version of the function should now handle the case where `make_current=True` appropriately and pass the failing test without raising the RuntimeError.
