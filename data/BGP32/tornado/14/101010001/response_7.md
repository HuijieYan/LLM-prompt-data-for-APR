### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with a specified flag `make_current`. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should ensure that the current `IOLoop` doesn't already exist. However, the bug causes the program to prematurely raise a `RuntimeError` even if an `IOLoop` doesn't exist.

### Bug Location:
The bug is located within the conditional block where `make_current` is `True`. The bug arises because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is incorrectly checking if `IOLoop.current()` is `None` before setting it using `self.make_current()`. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when initializing a new `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause:
The bug occurs because the conditional check before setting the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. It should check if the current instance exists and only raise an error if it exists when `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if `make_current` is `True`, and only then check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does, then raise the `RuntimeError`. If it doesn't, then set the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize()` function checks the condition for `make_current=True` appropriately and only raises the `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test scenario.
