### Analysis:
1. The error message is indicating that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when `make_current` is `True` in the `initialize` function. The `initialize` function is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance even though one already exists.
2. The `initialize` function checks if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make the current instance if one does not exist. However, if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, it raises an error.
3. The bug is caused by not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. To fix the bug, we should first check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one when `make_current` is `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By including the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` before trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is not raised if an existing instance is already present. This correction should resolve the bug.
