### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if an `IOLoop` is already set as the current one, and if not, it sets itself as the current `IOLoop`.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` according to the logic of the function.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised when running the test case, suggesting that the condition check in the `initialize` function does not work as expected when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.

### Proposed Fix:
We need to update the condition logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that it raises a `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False):` now checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make it current.

By applying this fix, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test without raising the `RuntimeError`.
