### Analysis:
The buggy function `IOLoop.initialize()` is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance. The issue arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, where it incorrectly throws a `RuntimeError` even if the current IOLoop exists.

### Identified Issue:
The issue in this buggy function arises from the condition `elif make_current:` where it mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists, instead of simply setting the current IOLoop.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check for `make_current` within the `IOLoop.initialize()` function. The condition should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is no current IOLoop and `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the conditional check to handle the case where `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
2. Use proper logic to determine whether to raise the `RuntimeError` based on the current existence of IOLoop and the value of `make_current`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the conditional check and logic within the `initialize()` function as shown above, the corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
