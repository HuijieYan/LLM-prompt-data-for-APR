### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function `initialize` checks if the current IOLoop exists and sets it as the current if necessary.
3. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised when an attempt is made to make the current IOLoop, even though it already exists.
4. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but there is already a current IOLoop instance present.

### Bug Cause:
In the buggy function:
- When `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if there is no current IOLoop (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`), and then makes it the current IOLoop by calling `self.make_current()`.
- However, in this scenario, if there is already a current IOLoop, it should raise an error according to the requirement.
- But the current logic does not account for the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop, leading to the `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised.

### Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug:
- We should first check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
- If the condition is met, raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the issue of checking if a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` has been addressed.
