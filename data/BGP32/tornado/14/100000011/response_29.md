1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file has a logic error that leads to a `RuntimeError` being incorrectly raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
   - The conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` followed by the `raise RuntimeError` statement is likely the cause of the bug.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The bug occurs because the `initialize` function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if it is `None`, it either calls `make_current` or raises a `RuntimeError`. However, in the scenario described in the GitHub issue, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is indeed `None`, but the `RuntimeError` is still being raised. This indicates a faulty condition check.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   - To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the `make_current` argument is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Otherwise, the `make_current` method should be called without raising any errors.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable for better readability and efficiency. Then, we adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the scenarios where the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not based on the `make_current` argument. The `RuntimeError` is now only raised when necessary, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
