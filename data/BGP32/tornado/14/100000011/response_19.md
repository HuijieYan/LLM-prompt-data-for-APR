### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `ioloop.py` checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None or not, and then raises a RuntimeError if it is not None. However, based on the GitHub issue description, there seems to be a confusion regarding the behavior at line 252 when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might be evaluated incorrectly.
2. The RuntimeError is being raised when it should not be according to the GitHub issue.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of the conditional statements. It seems like there might be confusion regarding the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being None or not, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements to ensure the correct behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we save the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` into `current_instance` variable for better readability and maintainability. Then, we adjust the conditional statements to check if `current_instance` is None or not as intended, thereby resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
