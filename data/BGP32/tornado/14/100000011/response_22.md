### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file has a potential error in the logic flow. The function is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` object and set it as the current instance if necessary. However, the bug occurs when checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` in the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not provided and the current instance is `None`, then the `make_current` method should be called. If `make_current` is provided as `True`, then it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current instance is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. The issue in the GitHub report is related to line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, but the logic is incorrect when validating the condition for raising a `RuntimeError`. The logic currently allows for raising the error even when the instance is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition check to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`.
2. Handle the case when `make_current` is not provided and the current instance is `None` correctly by calling `make_current`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` has been fixed to only execute when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None`. The function should now properly handle the initialization logic according to the intended behavior.
