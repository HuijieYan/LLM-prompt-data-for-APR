1. Analysis:
The provided buggy function is part of the tornado library in the ioloop.py file. The function initializes an IOLoop instance with a check to see if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If there is no existing current IOLoop instance, it sets the current instance using the make_current function. If there is an existing instance, it should raise a RuntimeError. 

The GitHub issue highlights a confusion regarding line 252 of the ioloop.py file, where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is checked for being None. The concern is why a "current IOLoop already exists" error is being raised if the current instance is None.

2. Potential error locations:
- The logic in the conditionals within the initialize function.
- Possible incorrect behavior of the IOLoop.current function.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect assumption made in the function's logic. The code checks for the absence of a current IOLoop instance (IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None). Still, it mistakenly raises a RuntimeError suggesting that a current IOLoop instance already exists, which is contradictory.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic inside the initialize function. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where a current IOLoop instance exists appropriately and where one does not exist.

5. Corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, I stored the result of IOLoop.current(instance=False) in a variable for better readability and then modified the conditionals to check if there is an existing current IOLoop instance correctly. Now, the function should behave as expected without erroneously raising an error when no current IOLoop instance is present.
