**Analysis:**
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file has a logic error where it checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if it already exists, even if it is actually None. This leads to a discrepancy mentioned in the GitHub issue where the error is raised despite `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returning None.

**Error Location:**
The potential error location is in the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` condition where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly raises a RuntimeError when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, assuming that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This causes confusion and contradicts what is expected based on the condition.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` condition to only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is not None. If `make_current` is False or None and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, no error should be raised.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With these changes, the bug should be fixed as the function will now correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is None.
