1. Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance is already initialized using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If `make_current` is not provided or is `True`, it is supposed to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does. However, the GitHub issue points out that on line 252, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`, yet the code is still raising an error for an already existing instance. This mismatch in behavior indicates a bug in the function.

3. Explaining the cause of the bug:
The cause of the bug is that the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not working correctly. Even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the function erroneously tries to raise an error for an already existing instance. This is contradictory and incorrect behavior, leading to the reported issue on GitHub.

4. Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the code correctly handles the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. It should only raise an error if an `IOLoop` instance exists when it shouldn't. The logic for checking an existing instance should be adjusted accordingly.

5. Corrected version of the function `initialize`:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_instance` to avoid redundant calls. Then, the logic for checking the existence of the current instance is adjusted to only raise an error if it is not `None` when it shouldn't be. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
