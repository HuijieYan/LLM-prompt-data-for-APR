1. Analyzing the buggy function:
   The provided buggy function `initialize` is part of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file. The function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already created or not and then initializes it based on the given parameters. There is a conditional check for `make_current` being `None` or not, and if not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

2. Potential error locations:
   The potential error in this function could be in the conditional check where it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, which seems contradictory based on the provided logic.

3. Cause of the bug:
   The cause of the bug is that the function is raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, indicating that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, the condition for `make_current` being `True` should directly initialize the `IOLoop` without raising an error.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
   To fix the bug, the conditional check for `make_current` being `True` should only initialize the `IOLoop` without raising an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None. This will ensure that the initialization is handled correctly based on the input parameter.

5. Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the function will now correctly check if the `IOLoop` instance already exists based on the value of `make_current` and handle the initialization accordingly.
