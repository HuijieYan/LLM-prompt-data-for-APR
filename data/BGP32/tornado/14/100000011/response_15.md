### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is checking the current instance of `IOLoop` and depending on the condition, it either makes the current instance or raises a `RuntimeError`. The issue reported on GitHub highlights confusion regarding the behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if make_current is None` may not be triggering as expected.
2. The condition where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked may have unexpected behavior.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is likely caused by the confusion in the conditions and actions based on the statuses of the `make_current` argument and the current instance of `IOLoop`. The issue arises from the discrepancy between the intention of the function and the actual behavior when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To resolve the bug, we need to make sure that the behavior of the function aligns with the expectations mentioned in the GitHub issue. Specifically, we should clarify the logic when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first save the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to avoid calling it multiple times unnecessarily. Then, we adjust the logic based on the saved `current_instance`. The function now correctly handles the situations where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not `None` based on the `make_current` argument.
