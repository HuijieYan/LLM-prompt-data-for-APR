### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` and then making it current if needed. However, there seems to be a bug in the logic where if `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance was not `None` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is `None`, which seems contradictory.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect logic in the condition where `make_current` is `True`.
2. Potential inconsistency in the check for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is `True`. If the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it should actually create a new instance instead of raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition with `make_current` being `True` to check if the current instance is `None`, create a new instance if it is `None`.
2. Ensure consistency in checking for the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()  # Create a new instance if current is not None

```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function, we address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves correctly based on the provided requirements.
