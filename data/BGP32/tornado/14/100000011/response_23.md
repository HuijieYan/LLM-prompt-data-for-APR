### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out that on line 252 of the file, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, so it is unclear why the function raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists".

### Identified Errors:
1. The logic within the `initialize` function seems incorrect, as it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` or not before proceeding, but the error is raised in both cases. This is contradictory and could be the cause of the issue mentioned on GitHub.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is not handling the check for the current instance of the IOLoop correctly. It is trying to initialize the IOLoop but raises an error even when the current instance is `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function where it determines whether to initialize or raise an error based on the current instance of the IOLoop.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the current instance of the IOLoop in a variable `current_instance`. Then we modify the if conditions to check `current_instance` instead of calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` multiple times. This ensures that the function behaves correctly based on the current state of the IOLoop instance.
