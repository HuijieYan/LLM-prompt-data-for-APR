1. Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and then tries to set it as the current instance if it doesn't exist. However, the logic seems to be incorrect as it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance already exists even though it is checking for its absence.

2. Error location:
The issue seems to be with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` as it is expected to be executed when the current IOLoop instance doesn't exist.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition checking for the current IOLoop instance's absence is incorrect. It should not raise a `RuntimeError` if the instance already exists. This logic contradicts the intended functionality.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the condition checking for the current IOLoop instance's absence should be modified. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, it should proceed to set the IOLoop instance as the current using `self.make_current()`.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- I added `is not None` in the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance exists.
- I modified the raise statement to raise a `RuntimeError` only if the current IOLoop already exists.
- This corrected version aligns the logic with the intended functionality and addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
