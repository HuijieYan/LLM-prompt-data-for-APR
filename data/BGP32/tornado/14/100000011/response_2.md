**Analysis:**
The buggy function provided is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`. This method is responsible for setting up the current `IOLoop` instance. The issue raised on GitHub mentions that at line 252, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, but the code still tries to raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

**Errors:**
1. The logic check for `IOLoop.current` being `None` is not consistent with the code execution that follows. If `IOLoop.current` is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` despite the condition later checking for the same condition.
   
**Cause of the Bug:**
The cause of the bug is that the code logic is incorrect. If `IOLoop.current` is `None`, the code should either create a new instance or raise a `RuntimeError`, but not both in different branches of the `if` statement.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the logic within the `initialize` method is consistent and correctly handles the case where `IOLoop.current` is `None`. We should either create a new instance or raise a `RuntimeError`, but not both.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable `current_loop` for readability and consistency.
   
2. We check if `make_current` is `None` and proceed to create a new `IOLoop` instance only if `current_loop` is `None`.
   
3. If `make_current` is `True`, we raise a `RuntimeError` only if `current_loop` already exists, as the GitHub issue suggested.
   
This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure consistent and correct behavior of the `initialize` method.
