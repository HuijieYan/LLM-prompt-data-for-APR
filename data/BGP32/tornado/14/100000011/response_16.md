Potential error locations:
1. Checking if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None twice without considering the make_current argument.
2. Incorrect conditional checks that may not handle the cases properly.

Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None twice without considering the make_current argument. This leads to inconsistent behavior when determining whether the current IOLoop already exists or not.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional checks to properly handle the make_current argument.
2. Ensure that the logic accurately determines whether the current IOLoop instance exists or not based on the make_current argument.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional checks and considering the current IOLoop instance before making decisions based on the make_current argument, the corrected function should now handle the scenario described in the GitHub issue.
