### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file of the Tornado library is checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it should also check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does instead of trying to make it the current instance.

### Identified Issues:
1. The condition `make_current` is `True` is not correctly handled. Instead of checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it should check if it already exists to raise an error.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` argument within the `initialize` function. It incorrectly assumes that if `make_current` is `True`, the current `IOLoop` instance may not exist, which leads to the error being raised inappropriately.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic when `make_current` is `True`. Instead of checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, we need to check if it already exists and then raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version ensures proper handling of the `make_current` argument, preventing the incorrect RuntimeError from being raised when the current `IOLoop` already exists.
