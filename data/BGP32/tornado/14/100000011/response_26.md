### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue Relationship
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. If `make_current` is provided and the current `IOLoop` instance exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised, which seems contradictory to the logic described in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Incorrect condition check when `make_current` is provided.
2. Logic issue within the condition blocks.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter when it is provided. The bug results in raising a `RuntimeError` even when the `current IOLoop` exists, as pointed out in the GitHub issue.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checks and logic handling when `make_current` is provided in the `initialize` function. Specifically, we need to make sure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is no current `IOLoop` instance present.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition checks and storing the current `IOLoop` instance in a variable, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary, addressing the issue raised on GitHub.
