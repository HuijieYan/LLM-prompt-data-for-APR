### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing an `IOLoop` object.
2. The issue complains about the behavior at line 252 within the `initialize` function, where it is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not.
3. The issue questions why a `RuntimeError` is being raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
4. The problem seems to be that the logic in the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, which seems contradictory to the purpose of the function.

### Potential Error Locations
- The conditional statement that raises the `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` might be causing the issue.

### Cause of the Bug
- The buggy function is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raising an error if it does not. However, this behavior conflicts with the purpose of the function to initialize an `IOLoop` object.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Instead of raising a `RuntimeError` if no current instance exists, the function should focus on initializing an `IOLoop` object when needed. It should be designed to handle both cases where a current instance exists or not.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable for efficiency.
- The function conditionally checks if `make_current` is `None`, in which case it only calls `self.make_current()` if no current instance exists.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current instance exists and raises an error or proceeds accordingly.
