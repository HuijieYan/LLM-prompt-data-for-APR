### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing the IOLoop. The issue on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the behavior of the function at line 252. It questions why an error is raised for an existing IOLoop instance even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Identified Error Locations:
1. The condition at `elif make_current:` is checking for an existing IOLoop instance but it should only do so if `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition is incorrectly checking for an existing IOLoop instance regardless of the value of `make_current`. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised even when there shouldn't be an existing IOLoop.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition at `elif make_current:` to only check for an existing IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True`.
2. Ensure that the `make_current()` method is called appropriately to initialize the IOLoop.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition at `elif make_current is True:`, the function now correctly checks for an existing IOLoop instance only when `make_current` is `True`. This resolves the issue of the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.
