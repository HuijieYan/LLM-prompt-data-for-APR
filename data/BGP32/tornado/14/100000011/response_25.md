### Analysis:
The GitHub issue highlights a discrepancy in the behavior of the `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file. The problem occurs at line 252 where the function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and whether to raise an error message. However, the logic seems to be incorrect as the error message is raised even when the `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The conditional check for the current `IOLoop` instance being `None`.
2. The logic for raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic within the `initialize` function. The function is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist and then either make it current or raise an error if it already exists. However, the logic is flawed, leading to the error message being raised even when the `IOLoop` instance is `None`, which is contradictory to the intended behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the conditional logic to properly determine whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not. The error message should only be raised if the instance is not `None` and `make_current` is true.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We store the current `IOLoop` instance in a variable `current_instance` for better readability and improved performance by not calling the function multiple times.
- The conditional checks are modified to ensure that the error message is only raised when the current instance exists and `make_current` is true, aligning with the expected behavior.
