## Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue

1. The buggy function provided is `initialize` from `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The GitHub issue identifies a problem at line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` but a RuntimeError is being raised for "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The cause of the bug appears to be that the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrectly handling the case when `make_current` is not None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. It should not raise an error in this scenario.
4. To fix the bug, the conditional statements in the `initialize` function need to be adjusted to properly determine when to raise an error.

## Fixing the Bug

Based on the analysis, here is a corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- We first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in `current_instance` for easier readability and to avoid calling the method multiple times.
- The conditional statements now check correctly if `make_current` is None or True, and whether the current instance exists or not before making a decision.
- The correct error handling logic is implemented to raise a `RuntimeError` only when appropriate conditions are met.

This corrected version should address the issue raised in the GitHub report.
