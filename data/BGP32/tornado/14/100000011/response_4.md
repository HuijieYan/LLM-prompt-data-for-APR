### Analysis:
1. The function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance based on the provided make_current argument.
2. The issue reported on GitHub raises a concern about line 252 where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` but still encounters a runtime error "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The bug seems to be related to the condition check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. If the current instance is None but the make_current argument is True, it should raise an error; however, the existing code is not handling this case correctly.
4. To fix the bug, the condition checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance needs to be adjusted to handle the case when the make_current argument is True and the current instance is None.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the existing code does not correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is None. Instead of checking for this case and raising an error, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()` leading to the erroneous behavior.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to check for the condition where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is None before calling `self.make_current()`. If that condition is met, we should raise a runtime error indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # get the current instance without creating one
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

In this corrected version, we first get the current IOLoop instance without creating one using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, we adjust the condition checks based on the current_instance value to handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current instance is None. If the conditions are met, we raise a runtime error; otherwise, we proceed with the initialization.
