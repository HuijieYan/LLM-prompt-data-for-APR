### Analyzing the Buggy Function and GitHub Issue:

1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and then either creating a new one or raising a `RuntimeError` if one already exists.
2. The GitHub issue mentions that at line 252, the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call is returning `None`, but the code is still raising a `RuntimeError` for an existing `IOLoop`.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations:
- The conditional checks in the `initialize` function may not be handling the case of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returning `None` correctly.
- It seems like the logic for determining the presence of an existing `IOLoop` instance might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs because the code is raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, which should mean that a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the conditional checks to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.
- Modify the logic to differentiate between the scenarios where there is no current `IOLoop` instance and when there is one.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Summary:
The corrected version of the `initialize` function ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an existing `IOLoop` instance is detected, addressing the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report. By properly checking the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and adjusting the conditional logic, the function now behaves as expected.
