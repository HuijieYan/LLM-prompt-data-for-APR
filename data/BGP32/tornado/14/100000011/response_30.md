### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if it already exists but is in fact `None`. This leads to confusion and a potential incorrect error message as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the condition checking `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which leads to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` but raises an error message assuming it already exists. This leads to confusion as reflected in the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly identify whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not and raise the appropriate error message.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we adjusted the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising the error message. This change ensures that the correct error message is raised based on the actual state of the `IOLoop` instance.
