### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and initializing it if necessary.
2. The issue on GitHub mentions that at `line 252`, the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, which triggers the conditional branch where it should initialize a new `IOLoop`, but instead, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `if` conditions in the function. The code should handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` properly to avoid raising an error when it should actually initialize a new instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic to ensure that the `make_current` function is correctly called when needed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. If `make_current` is specified as `True`, we can directly call `make_current` function.
3. If `make_current` is `None` or `False`, only initialize a new instance if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
4. Avoid raising an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and we need to initialize a new instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        if make_current is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
