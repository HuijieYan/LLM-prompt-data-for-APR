### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file initializes an `IOLoop` object with a `make_current` parameter. The bug seems to occur when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`. If `make_current` is true, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, but the bug causes it to raise the error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, the logic for checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` might be incorrect.
2. The condition for raising a `RuntimeError` based on the value of `make_current` might not be correctly handled.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to raise a `RuntimeError` is not correctly checking if `make_current` is true and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This results in the error being raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is true and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. We should also check the logic for handling the different cases of `make_current` more carefully.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` outside the condition checks for clarity.
- We then correctly check if `make_current` is true and current is `None` to raise a `RuntimeError` only when needed.
- The corrected version ensures that the error is raised only when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is true.
