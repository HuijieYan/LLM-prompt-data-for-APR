The bug in the `initialize` function is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly. The issue stems from the logic flow when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter. The function incorrectly checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, and if that condition is met, it then raises an error. This logic is incorrect because when `make_current=True`, we actually want to ensure that a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raise an error if not. 

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic for the `make_current=True` case in the `initialize` function. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we first check if `make_current is None`, and if so, we follow the previous flow. However, for the case when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, we check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and only then we raise an error. This logic aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the failing test.

By implementing this change, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the different cases based on the value of `make_current`, and the failing test case should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
