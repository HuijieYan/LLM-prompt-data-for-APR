### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` initializes an `IOLoop` object with an option to make it the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tests the behavior when trying to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.
3. The failing test expects that the current `IOLoop` instance remains unchanged after the failed construction attempt with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` without considering the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `initialize` function raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` even if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
- Check if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists before trying to initialize a new one with `make_current=True`.
- Only set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one if there isn't already a current instance.

### Corrected Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing functions here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected function checks if a current instance already exists before attempting to set the new instance with `make_current=True`. If a current instance exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, it sets the new instance as the current one.

The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
