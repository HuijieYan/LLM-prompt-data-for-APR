### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` object based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. The bug occurs when trying to handle the case where `make_current=True`, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly. The expected behavior in this case should be to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't already exist but not raise an error.

### Bug
The bug lies in the logic for handling the `make_current=True` case. The condition for raising an error is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when it's not necessary.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted for the `make_current=True` case. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should simply check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and only call `make_current` if it doesn't.

### Corrected Function
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function will behave as expected according to the defined test case and requirements.
