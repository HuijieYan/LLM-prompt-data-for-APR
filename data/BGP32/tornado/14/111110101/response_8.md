### Explanation:

The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if the parameter `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the bug occurs when trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance again if it already exists (as checked by `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`), which leads to a `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` when `make_current` is set to `True`. If the current instance already exists, it still attempts to set it again, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function. We should only attempt to make the current instance if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is not already set. If the `make_current` argument is None, no action should be taken. If `make_current` is set to `True` and the instance is already set, the function should not attempt to set it again.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function in this way, it should pass the failing test case provided.
