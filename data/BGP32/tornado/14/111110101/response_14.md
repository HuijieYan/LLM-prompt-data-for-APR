### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and behaves differently based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test case `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The failing test indicates that the error occurs when trying to construct a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.
4. The buggy code within the `initialize` function seems to incorrectly handle the situation when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists.

### Bug:
When `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, instead of only raising an error if a current instance does not exist (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`).

### Fix:
Change the condition in the `make_current` branch to only raise an error if a current instance does not exist, and remove the redundant check that current instance is None.

### The corrected code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
