The buggy function `initialize` is checking whether there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. If it finds an existing current `IOLoop`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

The issue lies in the comparison logic in the `initialize` function when checking for the presence of a current `IOLoop`. The current logic is comparing against `None`, which is not the correct way to check for the presence of a current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to compare against the current instance itself instead of `None` when checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:  # Check for the presence of a current instance
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:  # Check for the presence of a current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the comparison logic in the `initialize` function, the function will now properly check for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` only when necessary. This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
