### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another one with `make_current=True` again, which should result in a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is correctly raised when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug occurs because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect in the `initialize` function.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop`, even though it should only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Solution
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition in the `initialize` function to raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for existing IOLoop instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised in the `initialize` function if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
