### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with a specific behavior based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. In this case, a `RuntimeError` is raised incorrectly stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug arises from checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance with `instance=False`, which leads to the incorrect behavior, causing the exception to be raised when it should not.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust how we check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Solution
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to:
1. Modify the check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance to consider the actual running instance.
2. Only raise the `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the `initialize` function will check for the current `IOLoop` instance correctly and raise the `RuntimeError` only when necessary.
