### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it should ensure that there is no current `IOLoop` instance before making the current one. If there is a current instance and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current` is `True`, a new `IOLoop` instance is created and made the current one. If a current instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function where the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. It should first check if there is a current instance before attempting to make the current one. However, in the existing code, the check for the current instance is not done properly. As a result, it raises a `RuntimeError` even when there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Fix
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to properly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before either making the current instance or raising a `RuntimeError`. By adjusting the conditional logic, we can ensure that the correct behavior is enforced.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the case where a new `IOLoop` instance is created and made current only if there was no existing current instance, as expected by the failing test.
