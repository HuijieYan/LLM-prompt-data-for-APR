The buggy code is failing the test `test_force_current` because the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class incorrectly throws a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

The issue lies in the logic that checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. It incorrectly raises an error when `make_current` is `True` even though an instance already exists.

To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `True` but an instance already exists, we should simply return without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case and maintain the expected behavior for all cases.
