To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. 

The bug lies in the logic where the function raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the check for an existing current `IOLoop` is incorrect, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

To fix the bug:
- Check if `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. If it is not None, raise the `RuntimeError`.
- If `make_current` is None or False, the current logic should remain the same.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case provided.
