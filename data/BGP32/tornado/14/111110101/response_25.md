### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class initializes the instance of the class, and its purpose is to set the current `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional `make_current` parameter which, if set to `True`, should ensure that the current `IOLoop` is set.
2. The bug in the current implementation arises from not correctly handling cases where the current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`. It then tries to create a second instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised as the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance already exists.
5. The `IOLoop` class allows for managing the current `IOLoop` instance and setting a new one.

### Solution:
Given the analysis, the bug can be fixed by modifying the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to set a new one. If `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below:

```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # Get the current instance without making it current
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

The corrected version of the function should satisfy all the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
