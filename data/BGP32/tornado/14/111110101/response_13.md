### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is designed to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The issue lies in the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. The current implementation checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error if `make_current` is `True`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another instance with the same setting, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the new instance current.
5. The corrected version of the function should ensure that the behavior aligns with the test expectations.

### Proposed Fix:
1. Modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle making the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new instance current.
3. Only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test by correctly handling the `make_current` parameter and ensuring that the current `IOLoop` instance is handled appropriately.
