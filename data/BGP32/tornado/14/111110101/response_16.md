Based on the buggy function and the failing test, it seems that the bug is occurring because when `make_current=True`, the function is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, the logic is incorrect, as it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not appropriate here.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True`, then check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
2. If a current instance exists and `make_current=True`, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Otherwise, if `make_current=None`, set the current instance to the new `IOLoop`.
4. If `make_current=False`, create a new `IOLoop` without making it the current instance.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the case where `make_current=True` without an existing `IOLoop` instance, and raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test and handle the expected input/output values.
