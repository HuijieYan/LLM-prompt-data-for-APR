## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current loop already. If `make_current` is `None`, it should only set the current `IOLoop` if no current instance exists. A `RuntimeError` is raised if `make_current` is `True` but a current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set it as the current loop. It then tries to initialize another loop with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised since a current loop already exists.
3. The error occurs when the `make_current` argument is being processed incorrectly in the `initialize` function. The check for an existing current loop is not correctly evaluated.
   
## Bug Explanation
- In the current implementation of `initialize` function, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if it does. However, the conditions for checking the existing current loop are incorrect, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised even when there is no current loop.
  
## Solution
1. Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the presence of a current loop before raising a `RuntimeError`.
2. Ensure that the check for the presence of the current loop is done based on the actual existence of a current loop instance.
3. Also, verify that the logic correctly sets the current `IOLoop` based on the `make_current` argument:
   - If `make_current` is `True`, set the current loop if no current instance exists.
   - If `make_current` is `None`, set the current loop only if no current instance exists.
  
Let's correct the function implementation based on the analysis and solution. 

## Corrected Implementation
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
