### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an IOLoop instance is already current before making a new one current. If `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance is already current, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks that the current IOLoop instance is indeed the one just created. It also expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to make a new IOLoop instance current if one is already current.

### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`, but there is already an existing IOLoop instance current. This situation should raise a `RuntimeError`, as indicated in the failing test, but the buggy implementation raises the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance is already current. We should raise the `RuntimeError` in this case.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

```

By making the if condition in the `elif` block check `is not None` instead of `is None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to make a new IOLoop instance current if one is already current. This correction should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
