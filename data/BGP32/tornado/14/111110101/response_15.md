### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current `IOLoop`, unless there is already a current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set the current `IOLoop` instance unless there is already one.
3. The error occurs when the buggy function tries to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.
4. The expected behavior is to set the current `IOLoop` instance without raising an error if `make_current=True` and there is no existing current instance.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the logic where the function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. It raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`, even if there is no current instance.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. If no current instance exists, the code should proceed with setting the current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
