Based on the failing test and the code, the bug occurs when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an existing `IOLoop` instance is already the current one. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists without considering the `make_current` parameter correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance, then raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before making the new one current with `make_current=True`, we ensure that an error is raised as expected in the failing test.

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test and satisfy all the expected input/output values in the failing test cases.
