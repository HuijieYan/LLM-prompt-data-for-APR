Given the analysis of the bug and the failing test case, it seems that the bug occurs when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The buggy function raises a `RuntimeError` in this case instead of handling it properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the current instance. If there is already an instance and `make_current=True`, we should handle this case gracefully without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Handle the case when a current instance already exists
            # Maybe log a warning or take any other required action
            pass
        self.make_current()
```

By adding the logic to handle the case where a current instance already exists and `make_current=True`, we avoid raising a `RuntimeError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the failing test case.

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
