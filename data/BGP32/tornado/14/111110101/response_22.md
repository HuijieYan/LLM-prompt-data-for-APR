### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object and setting it as the current `IOLoop` instance when required.
2. The error message indicates that the code is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to a `RuntimeError`.
3. The buggy function fails in the scenario where `make_current=True` is passed as an argument, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True` when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before creating a new one with `make_current=True`.
2. If there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and `make_current=True`, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. If `make_current` is not provided, check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and set the new instance as the current one if needed.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code remains the same
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the above corrected version, the buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class should now handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test case.
