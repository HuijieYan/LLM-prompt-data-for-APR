### Explanation:

The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize an instance of the class and handle whether it should become the current `IOLoop` instance, based on the `make_current` parameter.

The bug in the current implementation is that it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, which leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised because the check is unsuccessful.

### Bug:
When `make_current` is `True`, the code checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, but it should be checking if there is a current instance instead.

### Solution:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the `elif` block to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance instead of the current incorrect check.

### The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By correcting the condition to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, the bug will be fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test.
