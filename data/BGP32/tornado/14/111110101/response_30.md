### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object, ensuring that it becomes the current `IOLoop` if necessary.
2. The buggy function checks the `make_current` parameter. If it is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method if there is no current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`.
3. The failing test creates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, then verifies that the object is the current `IOLoop`, and finally attempts to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs when the second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` is created because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where there is an existing current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the logic of the `initialize` function when checking if a current `IOLoop` already exists. When `make_current=True`, the function should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`. However, the current check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` before raising the `RuntimeError` causes the issue. This check only verifies if there is no current `IOLoop` without considering the case where there is an existing one, leading to the failure in the test.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where there is already a current `IOLoop`. Specifically, when `make_current=True`, we should check if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance the current one.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
