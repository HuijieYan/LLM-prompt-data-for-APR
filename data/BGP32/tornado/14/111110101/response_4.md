The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is incorrectly checking for the current existence of an `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. The function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, even though the intention is to ensure that the instance becomes the current one.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function for the case when `make_current` is `True`. We should only set the current instance if it is not already set, rather than raising an error if an instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()  # Set the current instance
```

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, the instance is set as the current one only if no instance is already set. This change aligns with the intended behavior as described in the test case.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass successfully as the logic now correctly handles setting the current `IOLoop` instance when needed.
