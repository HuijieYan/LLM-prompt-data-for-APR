The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before calling `make_current()`. This causes the test case `test_force_current` to fail because it expects an error to be raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if a current instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to raise an error if `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `test_force_current` test case should now pass as expected.
