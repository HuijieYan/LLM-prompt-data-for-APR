## Analysis
The buggy `initialize` function is supposed to handle the logic for making the current `IOLoop`. However, the current implementation has a logical error in checking whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug in the current implementation
The bug occurs when the function is called with `make_current=True`. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, but instead of throwing an error if it does exist, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`. This leads to the creation of another current `IOLoop` instance even if one already exists, which is not the expected behavior.

### Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to throw an error if `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We can simplify the logic by directly checking the condition and raising an error if it is not met.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other parts of the class remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

After making these changes, the corrected `initialize` function should now correctly handle the logic for making the current `IOLoop` instance and avoid creating duplicate instances when `make_current=True`.
