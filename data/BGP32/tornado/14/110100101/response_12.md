1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

2. The potential error location is in the conditional statement where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting the current instance.

3. The cause of the bug is that the current `IOLoop` instance is being set without considering if it already exists when `make_current` is `True`. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised erroneously.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to only set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance already set. Otherwise, it should raise a RuntimeError.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

After making this correction, the function should now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance set. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
