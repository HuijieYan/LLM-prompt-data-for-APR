### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` incorrectly and is not setting the current instance properly when `make_current` is `True`. This is causing the test `test_force_current` to fail as it expects the current `IOLoop` instance to be set correctly.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function in `IOLoop` class is not correctly setting the current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`. This causes the test case `test_force_current` to fail as it expects the current instance to be set when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the current instance of `IOLoop` is properly set when `make_current` is `True`. We should also handle the case where `make_current` is `None` to prevent any inconsistent behavior.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should correctly set the current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current` is `True`, and handle the case where `make_current` is `None` appropriately.
