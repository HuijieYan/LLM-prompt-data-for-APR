The issue with the `initialize` function is that when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If there is no current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`, but if there is a current instance, it doesn't make the current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we should make sure that when `make_current` is `True`, the function sets the current `IOLoop` instance regardless of whether there was one already or not.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current` is `True`, the current `IOLoop` instance is always set. This should now pass the failing test.
