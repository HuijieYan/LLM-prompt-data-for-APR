## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True`, or raise an error if there is already a current instance.
2. The buggy function has a logic flaw where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before trying to make the loop current, which leads to incorrect behavior.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case where an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly check if there is already a current instance before trying to make the loop current.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function will properly handle the case when a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`, preventing the creation of a second current instance and raising a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test.
