The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True`. The function is supposed to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists and if not, make the current instance.

However, in the current implementation, when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter, the function checks if a current IOLoop instance does not exist and then makes the current instance. This logic is incorrect because it should only raise an error if a current instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function to only raise an error if a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should now correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it the current instance.
