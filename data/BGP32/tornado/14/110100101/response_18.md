The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic used to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before making the current instance. The `make_current` argument is meant to control whether the new `IOLoop` instance should try to become the current one or not.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. The code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in this case, even though the intention is to only raise an error if there is already a current instance and `make_current=True`.

To fix this issue, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present without raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
# The source code of the corrected initialize function

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # raise error only if there's an existing current instance
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present, as intended.
