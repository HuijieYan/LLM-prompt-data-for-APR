The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. The bug occurs when the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then tries to make it the current instance if `make_current` is `True`. 

The bug arises because the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, instead of creating a new `IOLoop` instance. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality described in the comments.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if there is no current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. This should address the issues in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
