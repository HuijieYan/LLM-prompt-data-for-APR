The buggy function `initialize` is failing to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter. The issue lies in the conditional logic inside the function which is not properly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop`.

The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter, and the function is not properly checking if an `IOLoop` already exists. This leads to unexpected behavior and the RuntimeError being raised in the failing test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make the new `IOLoop` instance current. This should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass.
