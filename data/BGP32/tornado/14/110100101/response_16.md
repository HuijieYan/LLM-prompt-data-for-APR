The buggy function `initialize` has an issue where it doesn't properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. The logic currently checks if `make_current` is `None` and then attempts to make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. However, when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it should only make the current IOLoop if one already exists, otherwise raise a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop already exists.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `initialize` function to check both conditions separately. If `make_current` is `None`, it should check if a current IOLoop instance exists and make it the current one if not. If `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, it should only make the current IOLoop if one already exists and raise an error if not.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
