### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, including setting it as the current instance if `make_current=True`.
2. The bug lies in the comparison of `make_current` with `None`, where the current instance is not set correctly.
3. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then check if the current instance remains the same. The bug causes the current instance not to be set correctly, leading to a `RuntimeError` when trying to set it again.
4. To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the cases when `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False` to ensure the correct behavior.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        
        self.make_current()
```

This fix ensures that the current instance is correctly set based on the value of `make_current`.
