### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test

1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is testing the behavior of the `initialize` function when `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. The purpose of the `initialize` function is to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
4. The failing test expects that if `make_current` is set to `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.
5. The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic that checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Identified potential error location
The bug seems to be in the logic that checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before making a new `IOLoop` instance the current one.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function's logic does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of checking for the existence of a current instance and raising an error if `make_current=True`, it incorrectly proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Check for the existence of a current instance before setting a new one.
3. If `make_current=True` and a current instance exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
