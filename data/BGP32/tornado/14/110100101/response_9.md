### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, including setting it as the current instance if `make_current=True`.
2. The bug in the current implementation lies in the condition check for `make_current`. The code checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current instance. This check leads to an issue when `make_current=True`.

### Bug
- When `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it first checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is none, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, since `make_current` is already set to `True`, this condition should simply proceed to making the current instance without checking again.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
- Modify the condition check for `make_current` to directly call `self.make_current()` when `make_current=True` without checking for the presence of a current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    ...
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
