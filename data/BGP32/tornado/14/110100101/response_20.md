### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is meant to set the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance, causing a RuntimeError to be raised even though `make_current` is True.
3. The test `test_force_current` is designed to check that setting `make_current=True` creates the IOLoop instance as current, and subsequent attempts to create another current instance with `make_current=True` should raise a RuntimeError.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. It incorrectly raises a RuntimeError when `make_current` is True, regardless of whether there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current IOLoop instance and only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True and there is no current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

With the corrected function, the bug should be fixed and the `test_force_current` test should pass successfully.
