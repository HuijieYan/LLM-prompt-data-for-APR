### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`, then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and then calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not None. Finally, it calls `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True.
2. The issue lies in the logic flow of the function. When `make_current=True` is passed to the function, it should always call `self.make_current()`, regardless of whether the current `IOLoop` instance is None or not.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function `initialize` does not call `self.make_current()` when `make_current=True` if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None. This behavior is incorrect as it should always attempt to set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self.make_current()` is called when `make_current=True`, irrespective of the current state of the `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version ensures that `self.make_current()` is always called when `make_current=True`, which resolves the bug in the logic flow of the function.
