The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition checking for the current `IOLoop` instance. The function is supposed to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and either make the current one or raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True` but there is already a current instance.

The bug is caused by the incorrect comparison in the `initialize` function. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should be changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to correctly check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the comparison in the condition within the `initialize` function.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version should now pass the failing test provided.
