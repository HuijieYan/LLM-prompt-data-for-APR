The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make it current. This causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and no current instance exists.

To fix this bug, we can simplify the logic in the `initialize` function by directly setting `self.make_current()` if `make_current=True`, without checking for the existence of a current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version removes the unnecessary check for the existence of a current instance and directly calls `self.make_current()` when `make_current=True`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
