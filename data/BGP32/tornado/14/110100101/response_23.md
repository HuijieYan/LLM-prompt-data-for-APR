The bug in the `initialize` function is that it does not correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. 

The buggy function first checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is `None`, then it checks if there is currently no current `IOLoop`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current=True`, the function should raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop`, but it is currently allowing a second `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` to be created without raising an error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test.
