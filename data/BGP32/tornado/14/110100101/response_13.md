The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop object and handle the `make_current` parameter to ensure only one IOLoop instance is set as the current one. The bug in the function is that it incorrectly checks if a current IOLoop instance exists before setting the current instance, leading to the failure of the test case `test_force_current`.

The cause of the bug lies in the logic of checking for the current IOLoop instance. The current logic first checks if `make_current` is `None`, then checks if there is no current instance before attempting to set the current instance. However, in the test case, we explicitly want to force the creation of a new IOLoop instance and set it as the current one, regardless of whether there is an existing current instance.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current` is `True` and then directly set the current instance without checking for the existence of a current instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        pass  # Do nothing if there is already a current instance
```

By updating the logic in this way, we ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, the current instance is set without any checks. When `make_current` is `None`, we only set the current instance if no current instance already exists. And if `make_current` is `False`, we handle the case where the function explicitly should not make the current instance.

This correction should allow the `test_force_current` test case to pass successfully.
