## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` and then tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it also attempts to make the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should fail with a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:
    
    .. testcode::
    
        import errno
        import functools
        import tornado.ioloop
        import socket
    
        def connection_ready(sock, fd, events):
            while True:
                try:
                    connection, address = sock.accept()
                except socket.error as e:
                    if e.args[0] not in (errno.EWOULDBLOCK, errno.EAGAIN):
                        raise
                    return
                connection.setblocking(0)
                handle_connection(connection, address)
    
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
            sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)
    
            io_loop = tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current()
            callback = functools.partial(connection_ready, sock)
            io_loop.add_handler(sock.fileno(), callback, io_loop.READ)
            io_loop.start()
    
    .. testoutput::
       :hide:
    
    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.
    """

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()  # Always try to make the current IOLoop

```

By modifying the logic to first check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised correctly in the failing test case.
