The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug where it doesn't properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The buggy function is intended to ensure that there is always a current `IOLoop` instance, but the logic for checking and handling this is flawed.

The current bug causes the function to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, as seen in the failing test `test_force_current`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. We should check if there is already a current instance before trying to make the current instance, and if there is one, we should raise an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function will properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, while maintaining the intended functionality of ensuring there is always a current `IOLoop` instance.
