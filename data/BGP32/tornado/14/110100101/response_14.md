The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True`. The issue arises when checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before setting the current `IOLoop`. The bug causes the function to erroneously raise a `RuntimeError` even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `elif make_current:` block to check if there is no current `IOLoop` instance instead of checking if one exists, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test case provided.
