### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks the `make_current` parameter and either makes the current IOLoop instance or raises an error if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.
2. The bug seems to be in the condition where it checks if an instance already exists before making the current instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects to raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` if an instance already exists.
4. The bug can be fixed by changing the logic to first check if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, then raise an error.
5. The fixed version of the function should handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will first check if `make_current` is `True` before checking if an instance already exists. This ensures that the correct error is raised when necessary.
