### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it tries to make the `IOLoop` current if it doesn't already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it is supposed to make the `IOLoop` current.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to initialize another one with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` because a second attempt to make the `IOLoop` current should fail.
3. The bug occurs because the current instance check in the `initialize` function is not working correctly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make a new instance current.

### Updated/corrected code:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By adjusting the condition checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the existing current instance, we ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test.
