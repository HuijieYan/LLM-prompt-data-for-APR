### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether an IOLoop instance already exists before making it the current instance. It does this by calling the `current` method of the `IOLoop` class with `instance=False`. However, in the case where `make_current` is not provided (or is `None`), the buggy function first checks if there is no current IOLoop instance, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()` to make the current IOLoop instance. 

### Identifying the Issue:
The issue arises when the code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and if the `make_current` argument is not provided, it assumes that there is no current IOLoop instance and then calls `self.make_current()`. But the subsequent check for the `make_current` argument condition `elif make_current:` fails because `make_current` is `None`.

### Explanation of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes that the absence of `make_current` means there is no current IOLoop instance. However, when it reaches the `elif make_current:` condition, it tries to handle this case incorrectly and raises an error even though it tried to create a new IOLoop instance. This discrepancy leads to confusion as to whether the IOLoop instance exists or not.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we can modify the condition for checking the absence of `make_current` to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` separately. We should also ensure that the proper sequence of checking for the current instance is maintained without raising unnecessary errors. By addressing these conditional checks, we can resolve the issue.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the conditions are adjusted to handle the case where `make_current` is `None` separately and ensure that the check for the current IOLoop instance is performed correctly before making it the current instance.
