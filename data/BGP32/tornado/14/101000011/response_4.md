### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current or not and based on the condition it either sets the current instance or raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Identified Error:
The issue reported on GitHub focuses on line 252 in `ioloop.py`, where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked if it is `None` and questions the logic behind raising a `RuntimeError` if it is `None`. The error seems to be related to the handling of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current` is `None` and the current instance is also `None`, it tries to set the current instance, but without checking if another `IOLoop` instance is already set as current.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function. It should only set the current instance if it is `None` and no other `IOLoop` instance is currently set as the current one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version now properly checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already set as current before trying to replace it. It resolves the issue reported on GitHub related to the confusion surrounding the logic in handling the current `IOLoop` instance.
