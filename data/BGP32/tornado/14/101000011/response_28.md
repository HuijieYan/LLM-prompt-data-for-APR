### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function.
- If the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it calls the `self.make_current()` function to make the current `IOLoop`.
- The issue mentioned on GitHub questions the logic at line 252 where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, but then raises an error "current IOLoop already exists".

### Error:
The bug in the function lies in the if condition at line 252:
```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
The logic is contradictory because it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` but raises an error stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. This condition can never be true.

### Fix:
- To fix the issue, we need to adjust the logic at line 252 to remove the contradiction. 
- We can modify the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None and then raise an error if `make_current` is true.
- Additionally, we can simplify the code to improve readability.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in a variable for reusability. Then, we adjust the if conditions to address the logic issue and provide a clearer flow of execution.
