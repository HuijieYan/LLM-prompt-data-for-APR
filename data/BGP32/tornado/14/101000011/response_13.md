## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance. The issue mentioned on GitHub highlights a problem with the logic in the function. The function is checking whether the current instance of IOLoop is already existing or not, and based on that, deciding whether to raise a RuntimeError or proceed with initialization.

## Error Location:
The potential error in the buggy `initialize` function is in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which leads to either raising an error or proceeding with initialization.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the logic flow in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is not provided as an argument, it checks if an instance of IOLoop already exists. However, the issue pointed out on GitHub questions the rationale behind raising a RuntimeError when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None. This indicates a flaw in the condition check and exception handling.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check in the `initialize` function. Instead of raising an error when the current instance is None, we should proceed with initialization. Only raise an error if the current instance already exists and `make_current` is set to True.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition for raising a RuntimeError is modified to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when `make_current` is set to True. This change ensures that the error is raised only when an instance already exists and `make_current` is explicitly requested. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and provide a more logical flow for the initialization process.
