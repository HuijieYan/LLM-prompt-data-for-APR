## Analyzing the Bug

In the provided buggy function `initialize`, there seems to be an issue related to the logic of checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists. The function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance based on the provided `make_current` argument. However, the bug occurs when checking the existence of a current IOLoop instance.

The `initialize` function first checks if the `make_current` argument is not provided. If not provided, it calls the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function to check if a current IOLoop instance exists. If it does not exist, it then calls `self.make_current()` to create a new IOLoop instance.

However, the bug appears in the case where `make_current` is provided and not None. In this scenario, the function first checks if a current IOLoop instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does not exist, it correctly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that a current IOLoop already exists. But if an instance does exist, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()` again, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Potential Error Location

The bug in the `initialize` function occurs in the `elif make_current` condition. If `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop instance already exists, it should raise an error without calling `self.make_current()` again.

## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument when a current IOLoop instance already exists. The code incorrectly calls `self.make_current()` even when it should not create a new instance based on the provided conditions.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle cases where `make_current` is provided and an IOLoop instance already exists. We should only raise an error in this situation without trying to create a new instance.

## Corrected Version of the Function

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, the `elif make_current` condition now correctly checks if a current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` without calling `self.make_current()` again, avoiding the redundant creation of an instance.

By implementing this correction, the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
