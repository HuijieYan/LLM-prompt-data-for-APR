## Analysis:
1. The `initialize()` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and then either creates a new one or raises an exception.
2. The bug is related to the condition check where it checks if the `IOLoop.current()` is `None` or not.
3. The bug arises because the condition is inverted. The intention seems to be to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, create a new one. However, the condition is wrongly implemented.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition check to achieve the intended behavior.

## Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Corrected the condition within the `initialize()` function to have the intended logic. Now, it first checks if `make_current` is `None` and if `IOLoop` instance doesn't exist, it creates a new one. If `make_current` is provided and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
