## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class from the file `ioloop.py` has a logical issue related to the current instance of `IOLoop`. The issue raised on GitHub indicates that there is confusion related to the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent raise of `"current IOLoop already exists"`. This suggests that the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect.

## Potential Error Locations
The error likely lies in the conditional checks inside the `initialize` function:
1. The condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is being misinterpreted.
2. The logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists needs to be corrected.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs due to a misunderstanding in the logic flow. When `make_current` is none, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None. If it is None, then `make_current` is called. However, when `make_current` is not none, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does. This transition is not correctly implemented in the buggy function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statements in the `initialize` function. Specifically, when `make_current` is provided as an argument, we should first check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then decide whether to call `make_current` or raise an error.

## Corrected Version

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance has been adjusted. Now, if `make_current` is provided, it first checks if the current instance exists and raises an error if it does. Otherwise, it proceeds to call `make_current`. This modification should address the issue reported on GitHub.
