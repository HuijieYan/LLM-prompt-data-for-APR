### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if `make_current` is provided. If not, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`. If it is `None`, then it calls the `make_current` function to create a new instance of `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is provided and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Identified Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the comparison of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` with `None`. The condition in the `initialize` function is not handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` correctly.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because the logic of the `initialize` function is incorrect. When `make_current` is not provided and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, it should initialize the current instance. However, when `make_current` is provided, it checks if the current instance is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`, which leads to the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. We need to ensure that if `make_current` is provided, it should just call `self.make_current()` without checking if the current instance is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # this is the corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # removed the unnecessary elif condition
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we simplified the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to always call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is provided without checking if the current instance is `None`. This fix should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
