## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks for the presence of the current instance of `IOLoop` using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function. If the current instance is None and `make_current` parameter is not provided, it calls the `make_current()` function to set the current instance. If the `make_current` parameter is provided and set to True, it checks again if the current instance is None before setting the current instance. If the current instance is not None in this case, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

## Error Location:
The error occurs in the section of the `initialize` function where it checks if `make_current` is provided and set to True. If the `make_current` is True, but the current instance is not None, it incorrectly raises the `RuntimeError` "current IOLoop already exists".

## Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` parameter is provided and is True, the function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current instance is None to prevent creating multiple instances of `IOLoop`.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to correct the conditional check when `make_current` is provided and set to True. The `RuntimeError` should only be raised when the current instance is None.

## Corrected Version:
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the bug is fixed by changing `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif make_current` section. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when the current instance is already present.
