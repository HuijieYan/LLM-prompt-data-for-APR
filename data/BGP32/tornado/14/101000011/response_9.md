### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is incorrectly checking the condition for `make_current`. The `if make_current` condition should be `if not make_current` to ensure that the `make_current()` function is called when `make_current` is None.

### Potential error locations:
1. Incorrect condition checking for `make_current`.
2. Possible confusion in logic flow.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the buggy function `initialize()` checks for `make_current` being True, which is not the intended logic. This leads to the incorrect raising of the RuntimeError when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to `if not make_current` to ensure that `make_current()` is called when `make_current` is None.
2. Remove unnecessary checks related to `make_current`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif not make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By making the above corrections to the `initialize()` function, the issue mentioned in the GitHub report should be resolved, and the logic of the function will be more coherent.
