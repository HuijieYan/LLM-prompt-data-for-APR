### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current IOLoop.
2. It checks if the `make_current` parameter is provided, and based on that, whether the current IOLoop already exists. If it does and `make_current` is True, it raises an error.
3. The issue on GitHub questions the logic in line 252 of `ioloop.py` which raises an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None.

### Potential Error Location:
The issue may arise from the condition where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition when checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The logic in the buggy function incorrectly raises an error even when the current IOLoop is not present based on the existing condition.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The condition that checks if the current IOLoop instance is None needs to be corrected to accurately determine if a new IOLoop instance should be created or if an error should be raised.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is not modified, and the error-inducing condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is replaced with `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`. This change ensures that the error is only raised when the current IOLoop instance exists.
