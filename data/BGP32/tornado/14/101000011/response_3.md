Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might not be working as intended.
2. The logic for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raising an error is unclear.

Cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the confusion in the logic of checking the current IOLoop instance. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might be mistakenly triggering the `RuntimeError` even when the current instance exists.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic for checking the current IOLoop instance and ensure that the condition is correctly evaluating the presence of the IOLoop instance.
2. Make the logic clearer to avoid confusion and misinterpretation of the existing code.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition to check if IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the function should address the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the condition for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance is correctly evaluated before raising an error.
