### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking the current instance of `IOLoop` using the `current` method.
2. If `make_current` is None, it checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists by calling `IOLoop.current`.
3. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and raises an error if it does.
4. The GitHub issue questions the logic behind raising an error when `IOLoop.current` returns `None`.

### Potential Error Location:
The bug might be in the condition where it checks if `make_current` is None and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. An issue might arise here if the logic is not as intended.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is incorrectly checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. The issue arises due to how the conditions are structured and how `IOLoop.current` is being used.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs a revised logical flow to accurately determine if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. Proper handling and error checking should be implemented based on the specific conditions.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
1. The condition for `make_current` not being None has been simplified.
2. The condition for checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists has been adjusted to fix the logic and error handling.
3. The error will now be raised only if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is set to a truthy value.
