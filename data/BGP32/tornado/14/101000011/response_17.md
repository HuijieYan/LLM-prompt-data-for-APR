### Analysis:
The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class has a logic issue relating to the `make_current` parameter. The bug occurs when `make_current` argument is provided and it is `True`, where the function then incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` despite the condition being met.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter.
2. Improper comparison with the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is provided and is `True`, the function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if it is indeed `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, this contradicts the purpose of the condition where the intent is to make the current IOLoop instance current, not to raise an error if it already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is provided and is `True`. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should simply make the current IOLoop instance current if it already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # Adjusted logic: Do nothing if IOLoop instance already exists
                pass
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` remains as before when `make_current` is `None`.
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` is added to prevent raising an error if the IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
- The unnecessary `raise RuntimeError` statement is removed.
