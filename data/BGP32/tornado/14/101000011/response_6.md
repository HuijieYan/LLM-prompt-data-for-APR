### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then tries to make it the current instance. However, there is a bug in the logic where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True`.

### Identified Issue:
The issue lies in the condition `elif make_current:` where it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, which is not the correct condition to check for. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise an error immediately because the instance may already exist. The error should only be raised if `make_current` is `None` and the current instance is also `None`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` then raise the `RuntimeError`.
2. Ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before making it the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current == True:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function fixes the bug by ensuring that `make_current` is only checked for raising an error when it is `None` and the current `IOLoop` instance is also `None. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting it as the current instance.
