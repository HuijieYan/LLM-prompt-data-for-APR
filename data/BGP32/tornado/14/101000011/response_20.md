## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. It first checks if a specific `IOLoop` instance should be made current. If not, it checks if the current instance is `None` and then makes the current instance. However, there seems to be a logical error leading to the issue raised in the GitHub thread.

## Error Location:
The error is likely due to the conditions inside the `initialize` function failing to properly handle the case where `make_current` is provided as `True`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, the code should set the current instance immediately without checking if it is `None` because if it is `True`, the current instance should already exist. However, the current implementation checks for `None` even when `make_current` is `True`, leading to the incorrect runtime error.

## Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the condition for `make_current` being `True` should be handled separately without explicitly checking if the current instance is `None`. This will avoid the case where a `RuntimeError` is raised incorrectly.

## Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:  # Update this condition
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `elif make_current:` to `elif make_current is True:`, the function now explicitly handles the case where `make_current` is `True` without unnecessarily checking the current instance. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
