### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method.
- The issue on GitHub points out that when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though it seems contradictory.

### Potential Error Locations:
- The condition checking logic within the `initialize` function is likely causing the bug.
- The logic inside the `initialize` function where it raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` might be incorrect.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the logic that checks the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. If the instance is `None`, the code should not raise an error because it is checking if the instance doesn't exist.
- The current logic in the buggy function is raising an error even when it finds that no current instance exists, which is contradictory.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
- If the current instance is `None`, then the code should proceed with setting the instance, not raise an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Changes Made:
- Updated the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising an error.
- This change ensures that the error is raised only when a current instance already exists, resolving the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
