## Analysis:
The buggy function in the `IOLoop` class is `initialize()`. The issue raised on GitHub is questioning the logic around the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` in the `initialize()` function.

## Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` seems to be causing confusion.
2. The logic that follows based on the condition mentioned above might not be correct.

## Cause of the Bug:
The issue arises from a misunderstanding of the logic implemented in the `initialize()` function. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if there is no current instance of the `IOLoop`. However, the confusion lies in the subsequent logic that follows this condition.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the intention of the code is clear before implementing any changes.
2. Review the logic in the `initialize()` function to make sure it correctly handles the case where the current instance of `IOLoop` is or is not `None`.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize()` function clarifies the logic related to the current instance of `IOLoop` and correctly handles the cases where it is `None` or not.
