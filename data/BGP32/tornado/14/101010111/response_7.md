The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition check for whether an IOLoop already exists. The issue arises because in the initial condition, `make_current` is `True`, so the function checks if an IOLoop already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it returns `None`, indicating that an IOLoop does not exist, the code attempts to make the current IOLoop (calling `self.make_current()`). However, in the `elif` block, the code again checks if an IOLoop is `None`, and if it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` for "current IOLoop already exists", contradicting the earlier logic.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the conditions for checking the existence of an IOLoop and removing the contradiction in the `if-elif` blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
