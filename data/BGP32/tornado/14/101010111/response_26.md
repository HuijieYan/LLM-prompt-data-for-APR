### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance by checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If `make_current` is not provided, it should only create a new `IOLoop` instance if there is no current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should create a new `IOLoop` instance only if there is no current instance; otherwise, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is raising a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though the check for the current instance being `None` seems to pass.

### Bug:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. It incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the check for the current `IOLoop` instance being `None` passes due to a faulty conditional block.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the `initialize` function incorrectly handling the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The condition for checking the existence of a current instance is not properly evaluated when `make_current` is `True`, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the conditional checks in the `initialize` function need to be corrected to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is `True`. Additionally, the logic to make the `IOLoop` instance current should be properly handled based on the provided `make_current` parameter.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Corrected the condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, the bug causing the incorrect `RuntimeError` is resolved.
