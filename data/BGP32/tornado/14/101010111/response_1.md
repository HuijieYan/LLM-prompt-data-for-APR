### Identification of potential error locations:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current()`.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Explanation of the bug:
1. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise an error if the `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The bug arises from the incorrect logic flow in the `initialize` function, where it raises an error when `make_current` is `True` and the `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should only create a new `IOLoop` instance if one does not already exist. It should not raise an error if the instance is already there.

### The corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if an instance already exists
                self.make_current()  # Create a new instance if not already exists
``` 

By updating the `initialize` function in this way, the corrected function will correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, ensuring that it creates a new `IOLoop` instance only if one does not already exist. This correction aligns with the expected behavior and will resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
