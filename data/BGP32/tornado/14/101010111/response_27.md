## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to set the current IOLoop if it is not set already based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current IOLoop unless it is already set, in which case it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. The bug seems to be occurring because the check for the current IOLoop being `None` is not properly handling the condition where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists while `make_current` is set to `True`, causing the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists. We should only set the current IOLoop in that case if it is not already set.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            return  # Already set, no action needed
        self.make_current()
```
