### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is `True` and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, a RuntimeError is raised.
3. The error message indicates that when requesting to force creating a current IOLoop instance (`make_current=True`), the code incorrectly raises an error if an IOLoop instance already exists.
4. The issue seems to be with the condition check for existing IOLoop instance, which should only raise an error if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and an instance already exists.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to revise the condition check for existing IOLoop instance. The error should only be raised when `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and not just because an instance exists. 

### Code Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Change the condition check
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Update the check to see if an instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition check for `make_current=True`, we ensure that the error is only raised if an instance already exists and `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. This change addresses the issue described in the GitHub report and allows the function to work as intended.
