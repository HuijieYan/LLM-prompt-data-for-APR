### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists or not. If it does not exist, it calls `make_current` to set the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. The failing test is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. The test is failing with a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Error Cause:
The bug occurs because the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is incorrectly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. The control flow does not consider that if `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not proceed and raise an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to first check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. Only if there is no existing instance should the code proceed to set the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to check if an `IOLoop` instance is not `None` when `make_current=True`, the corrected version of the function ensures that it only sets the current instance if it does not already exist.
