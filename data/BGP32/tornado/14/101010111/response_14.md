### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking whether the `make_current` parameter is None or not. If it is None, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if so, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is not None, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised when `make_current` is True, but the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing.

3. The code logic seems to be incorrect in checking the condition for raising an error. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the `RuntimeError` is being raised. It should only raise the error when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is not None.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
