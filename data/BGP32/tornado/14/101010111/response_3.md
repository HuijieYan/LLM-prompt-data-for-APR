### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is not provided, it ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is set as the current one by calling `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it also checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if so.
2. The failing test is attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but due to how the condition in the buggy function is structured, it wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` for an existing `IOLoop`.
3. The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists. It should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and no instance exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditions in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly raise a `RuntimeError` only when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
