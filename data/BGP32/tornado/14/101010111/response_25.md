### Analysis
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and then makes the current instance if needed. If `make_current` is provided and evaluates to `True`, it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises an error if it's not `None`.
   
2. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but it throws a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

3. In the failing scenario, `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` which causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly. The expected behavior is to only raise the error if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

4. To fix this bug, we should modify the logic of the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check the value of `make_current` before raising the error.
2. Update the logic to only raise the error if `make_current` is explicitly `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Modify this condition
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change to not None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above changes, the corrected function should now correctly handle the case when attempting to force the creation of a current `IOLoop` instance when one already exists, passing the failing test and addressing the GitHub issue.
