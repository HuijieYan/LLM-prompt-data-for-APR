The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is incorrectly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before making the current instance. The issue lies in the logic where it is raising an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, indicating that there is no current instance.

### Explanation of the Bug
The bug occurs because the logic in the buggy function is inconsistent. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should be setting the current IOLoop instance. However, the check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None` should not trigger an error in this case. It should only raise an error if an instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle setting the current IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. We should only raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists and we are trying to create a new one.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `elif make_current` block has been changed to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` to correctly check if an instance already exists before setting the current instance.
- The logic now aligns with the expected behavior of creating a new IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, and raising an error only if an instance already exists.
