Based on the provided information, we can see that the buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is incorrectly checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current `IOLoop` already exists. The erroneous logic in the buggy function causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised when it shouldn't.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. The buggy function's logic checks if `make_current` is `True` and then proceeds to check if the current `IOLoop` is `None`. If it's not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` incorrectly.
2. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which contradicts the condition checking within the buggy function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic within the `initialize` function. Specifically, when `make_current` is set to `True`, we should only create a new `IOLoop` if the current instance is `None`. Otherwise, we should proceed without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # ignore this function implementation

    def make_current(self):
        # ignore this function implementation

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
                pass
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised, we ensure that the `initialize` function adheres to the expected behavior and passes the failing test case.
