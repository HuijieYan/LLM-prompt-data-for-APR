### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object by setting it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is not provided, it should only set the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the current IOLoop already exists, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. The bug is caused by incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop is `None` before setting itself as the current IOLoop when `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop already exists and `make_current` is `True.

### Fixing the bug:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly check if the current IOLoop exists when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the function only raises a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop object is already set as the current one. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
