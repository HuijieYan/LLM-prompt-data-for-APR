### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop object with a specific configuration. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop object already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. However, this logic seems to be flipped.
2. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` even though the IOLoop already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the IOLoop already exists is reversed. When `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise an error if the IOLoop already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to switch the condition for checking if the IOLoop already exists to match the expected behavior.

### Updated Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixing the condition here
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now checks if the IOLoop object already exists correctly based on the provided `make_current` parameter. This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
