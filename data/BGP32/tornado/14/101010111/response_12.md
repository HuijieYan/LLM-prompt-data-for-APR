### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None` and then calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`.
2. In the failing test, the input parameter `make_current` is provided as `True`. The implementation first checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which it is not in this case. So, it directly goes to the `elif` block and raises a `RuntimeError` even though the existing `IOLoop` instance is expected behavior.
3. The error message indicates that the issue lies in the check for `None` causing the RuntimeError even when the `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The code mistakenly raises an error if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance, even though this scenario is valid.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic that checks for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead of raising an error immediately, we should only call `self.make_current()` if needed.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current=True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance. This change should fix the bug and ensure that the failing test passes as expected.
