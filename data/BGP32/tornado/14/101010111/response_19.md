## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to True but there is already a current IOLoop instance, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.
3. The issue is that the logic in the `initialize` function is flawed - it should only raise an error if `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional statement that checks if the current IOLoop instance exists.

## Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
