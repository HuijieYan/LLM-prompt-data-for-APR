The bug in the `initialize` function arises from a conditional check that incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when it shouldn't. The bug stems from incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` parameter.

**Potential Error Location**:
- The conditional check for `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function.

**Cause of the Bug**:
- In the buggy code, when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The expected behavior should be to raise the error only when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.
- This issue was likely noticed by a user contributing to the project, leading to the GitHub issue being raised.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
- To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` correctly.

**Correction**:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustment to the condition checking for `True` and `False` cases of `make_current`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when needed. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
