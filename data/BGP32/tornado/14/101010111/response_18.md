## Bug Explanation

The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is due to the incorrect logic when checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The bug causes the RuntimeError to be raised even if the `IOLoop` instance does not exist.

Here is the breakdown of the bug:
- In the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code first checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None`, and if it is not `None`, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this behavior is incorrect as it should only raise an error when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- The issue stems from the conditional statements that are checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The logic should be modified to properly handle the case when the `IOLoop` instance does not exist and only raise an error when it already exists. 

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` is not set. The fix involves modifying the conditional statements to properly check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raise a RuntimeError only when it already exists.

## Corrected Version

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditional statement in the `initialize` function to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising a RuntimeError, the bug should be fixed. This correction aligns the logic with the expected behavior based on the described bug and the failing test case.
