## Analyzing the bug and its origins:

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. When the `initialize` method is called with `make_current=True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing. 
2. The bug occurs because even if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, it still attempts to create a new one and raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that "current IOLoop already exists".

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing needs to be modified. Instead of checking if it is `None`, we should check if it is `not None` to correctly handle the case where an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance is None
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance is NOT None
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will correctly handle the scenario where there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and avoid raising a `RuntimeError` inappropriately.
