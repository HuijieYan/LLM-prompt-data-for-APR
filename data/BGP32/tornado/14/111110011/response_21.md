### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`.
   - The class has methods `current` and `make_current` which are used within the buggy function.
   
2. **Error Location**:
   - The bug is likely within the conditional statements of the `initialize` function where it checks the current status of the `IOLoop` instance.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs because when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. 
   - If it does not exist, the function still raises `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`, which is contradictory.

4. **Fix Strategy**:
   - In the case where `make_current=True`, the initialization function should not raise the `RuntimeError`, as it is expected that the current `IOLoop` instance might not exist at that point.
   - We should adjust the conditional logic to avoid raising the error when `make_current` is passed as `True`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- The check for `make_current=True` has been modified to only raise the error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- This modification should resolve the issue raised in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
