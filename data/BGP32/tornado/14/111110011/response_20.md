### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance including setting it as the current IOLoop if necessary.
2. The error occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance present.
3. The bug is triggered by the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` which incorrectly checks if there is no existing IOLoop instance and then tries to make the current IOLoop. This logic is incorrect because even if there is no existing instance, the function should not be trying to set it as current if `make_current=True` as it would lead to the RuntimeError being raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to handle the case when `make_current=True` separately from the case when `make_current=None`.
5. By updating the condition check in the `initialize` function, we can ensure that the current logic is correctly implemented.

### Correction:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current == True:  # Change the condition check
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the issue with the buggy function should be resolved and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
