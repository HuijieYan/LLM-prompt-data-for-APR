### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize an instance of `IOLoop`.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The original logic in the buggy function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The bug is due to the incorrect handling of the logic for creating a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. The method should only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.
5. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks to properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By introducing the `current_instance` variable to store the current `IOLoop` instance, we can correctly check for its existence and handle the creation of a new instance based on the `make_current` parameter. This revised logic ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
