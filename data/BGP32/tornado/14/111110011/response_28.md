### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance based on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is an existing current IOLoop instance and if not, it sets the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current instance only if there is no existing current instance, otherwise raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. A failing test `test_force_current` is provided to test the behavior of setting the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Error:
The error occurs because the current IOLoop instance is already existing when trying to set a new one with `make_current=True`, which should result in a `RuntimeError`. However, the buggy function is not checking this condition correctly, leading to the incorrect behavior.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the condition in the `initialize()` function to correctly check if a current instance already exists before setting a new one when `make_current=True`. If an existing current instance is found, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize()` function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # previous class definitions

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is `not None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when an existing current instance is found.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case.
