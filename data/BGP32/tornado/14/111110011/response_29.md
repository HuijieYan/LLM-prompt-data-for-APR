### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function checks the value of the `make_current` argument, and if it is not provided, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If not, it sets itself as the current instance.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present, causing an erroneous `RuntimeError`.
4. The issue identified is that even if `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise an error if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, as it is supposed to set itself as the current.
5. To fix the bug, we should remove the check for an existing current instance when `make_current=True` and simply set the instance as the current.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By removing the redundant check for an existing current instance when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the `IOLoop` instance is always set as the current instance without raising an error unnecessarily.
