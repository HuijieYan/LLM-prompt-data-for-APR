### Explanation:
The issue here arises from the condition check in the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The code is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if it is, it tries to make it the current instance by calling `self.make_current()`. However, in the next condition block, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it again checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is not `None` at this point, it raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists".

The problem is that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it should not be checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, but rather it should directly try to make the current instance the new `IOLoop`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to make sure that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code skips the check for `None` and directly proceeds to making the current `IOLoop` instance the new one. This will prevent the `RuntimeError` from being raised when it should not.

### Corrected Version:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # existing class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Correct logic here
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and avoid unnecessarily checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
