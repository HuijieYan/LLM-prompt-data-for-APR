### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue where it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None even if `make_current=True` is passed as an argument.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then asserts that it should be the current instance, but the bug in the `initialize` function causes an error to be raised incorrectly.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being triggered when trying to initialize a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` even though the current instance is already present.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. In the `initialize` function, if `make_current=True`, check if there is already a current instance, and if so, raise an error indicating that it already exists. This will prevent creating a new current instance when one is already present.
2. Update the condition to raise an error only if `make_current=True` and there is an existing current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing code

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will now correctly check if a current instance exists before attempting to make the new instance current when `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test.
