### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
   
2. **Bug Location**: The bug seems to be in the logic related to checking the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The buggy function first checks if `make_current` is `None`. If so, it checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists. If not, it tries to make the current instance, which might result in multiple instances trying to be current.
   - When `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if a current instance exists and if so, raises an error stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which seems contradictory.
   - The failing test expects that when `make_current=True`, the current `IOLoop` instance should be set, but the buggy function does not handle this scenario appropriately.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Ensure that when `make_current=True`, the current instance is set correctly without raising an error if it already exists.
   - Modify the logic within the `initialize` function to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and provide appropriate feedback.
   
### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Do not raise an error if a current instance already exists
            # Simply set the current instance without changing it
            return
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic as shown above, we ensure that when `make_current=True`, the current instance is set correctly without raising an error if it already exists.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test provided.
