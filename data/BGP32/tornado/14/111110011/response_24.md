### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize a new instance of `IOLoop`. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`. In this case, it first checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists, and if not, it calls the `make_current` method to set the new instance as the current one. However, the bug arises when it checks again if there is already a current instance and raises a `RuntimeError` even though the current instance is already set.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the redundant check for the existing current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current=True`. The first check is valid to ensure there is no existing instance. However, the second check causes the bug, where it raises an error even when the instance is correctly set as the current one.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we can remove the second check for the current instance when `make_current=True`. This way, after confirming the absence of the current instance, we directly call `make_current` and set the new instance as current without performing the redundant check.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Fixed: Check for not None
            self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the fixed function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` without mistakenly raising an error when the current `IOLoop` instance exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
