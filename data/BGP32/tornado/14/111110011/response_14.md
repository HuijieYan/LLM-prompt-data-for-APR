### Error analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. It then proceeds to either make the current instance or raise an error if it already exists.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The test expects that the initial `IOLoop` instance should be set as the current one, and subsequent attempts to create new `IOLoop` instances with `make_current=True` should fail.
- The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists when trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`, which triggers the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug cause:
- The bug is caused by the logic inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function first checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If the current instance is `None`, it proceeds to call `self.make_current()`, which sets the current instance. However, on the next check, if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even though it should proceed to set the current instance.

### Bug fix strategy:
To fix this bug, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. We need to ensure that if a current instance exists, the function should not raise an error but simply return without setting a new current instance.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Updated condition to check for existing current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the function behaves correctly when `make_current=True` is passed. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
