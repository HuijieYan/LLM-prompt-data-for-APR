### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set up the current IOLoop instance. It checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance, and based on the `make_current` parameter, either sets the current IOLoop or raises an error if it's already set and `make_current=True`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then verifies that the current IOLoop is correctly set and cannot be set again.
3. The error occurs when the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class incorrectly raises an error when trying to set the current instance while it is already set.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop instance is already set and `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to check if the current instance is already set before trying to potentially set it again.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is already set, raise an error indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. Adjust the logic to properly handle both cases when setting the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function in the IOLoop class
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the corresponding failing test `test_force_current` should pass without raising the RuntimeError.
