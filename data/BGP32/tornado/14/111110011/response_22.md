### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with a specified flag `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if that is the case.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another instance with the same flag set to `True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The failing test error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised even though the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance returns `None`. This behavior is incorrect as the error should only be raised if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance when trying to make the current instance.
4. The buggy function logic incorrectly raises `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` even if there is no existing current `IOLoop` instance. This issue might be related to the implementation of `IOLoop.current()` and `IOLoop.make_current()` methods.
5. To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise `RuntimeError` if there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Modify the conditional statements to correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. Update the logic flow to ensure that the RuntimeError is raised only when necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the necessary modification to the conditional statement in the `initialize` function as shown above, the issue reported in the GitHub bug will be resolved, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
