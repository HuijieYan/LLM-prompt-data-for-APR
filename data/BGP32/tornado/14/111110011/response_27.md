### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` before calling `self.make_current()`. However, it then has a redundant check inside the `elif` block where it again checks if the current instance is `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test is trying to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and expects the second call with `make_current=True` to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test fails because the redundant check in the `initialize` function does not allow the intended behavior when `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant check and allow the behavior to raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
# This is the corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            if make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function as shown above, we remove the redundant checks and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised correctly when `make_current=True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
