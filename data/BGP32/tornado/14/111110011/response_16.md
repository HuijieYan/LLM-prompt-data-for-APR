### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` argument is `None`, then it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and if it is `None`, it sets the current instance using `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and raises an error if it is not `None`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, then it attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test expects the second attempt to create an instance with `make_current=True` to throw a `RuntimeError`, indicating that a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, the buggy function incorrectly raises the error even when a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, leading to the test failure and error message shown.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic within the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that the error is only raised if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`. This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and pass the failing test.
