### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` is passed as an argument and there is already an existing current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError` because there is already a current instance.
3. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None.
4. The GitHub issue points out the discrepancy in the behavior of line 252 of `ioloop.py`.
5. The bug is in the condition `if make_current:` where even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it still raises an error. The bug is caused by the incorrect implementation of the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the condition `if make_current:` to correctly check if `make_current` is True before checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Fix the condition here
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for an existing instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current=True` and there is an existing current instance.
