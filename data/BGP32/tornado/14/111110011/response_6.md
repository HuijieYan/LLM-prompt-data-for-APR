### Analysis:
1. Bug Location: 
   - The bug is located in the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.

2. Cause of the Bug:
   - The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, then it proceeds to either make it the current instance or raise an error. However, the logic is flawed as it incorrectly raises an error even if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` while `make_current=True`. This leads to the `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists when it does not.

3. Fixing Strategy:
   - To fix the bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize` function. Specifically, we should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance, we should go ahead and make the current instance. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the correction in the `initialize` function as shown above, the logic now correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current` and only raises an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current=True`. This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
