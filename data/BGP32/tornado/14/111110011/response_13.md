### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` flag is set, but there is an issue with how it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The bug is located in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before making itself the current instance.
3. The bug occurs because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is not done correctly, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised even if no current instance exists. This is evident from the failing test where the second attempt to create an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` fails.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function as shown above, we first store the result of `IOLoop.current()` in a variable `existing_instance` and then check if it is not None before raising the `RuntimeError`. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` instance is already present.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By applying this fix, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test without raising the `RuntimeError`.
