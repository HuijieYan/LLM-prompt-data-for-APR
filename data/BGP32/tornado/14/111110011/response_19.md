### Explanation of the Bug:

The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument to `initialize`, triggering the section of code that checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. However, the logic for this check is incorrect.

1. When `make_current=True` is passed:
   - The code checks if there is no current instance of `IOLoop` (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`).
   - If there is no current instance, it is supposed to make the current instance the new instance. However, if there is an existing instance, it should raise an error.
   - In the buggy code, the error is being raised when there is no current instance, which is incorrect. It should only happen if there is already a current instance.

### Suggested Fix:

The bug can be fixed by correcting the logic in the `initialize` function to raise an error only if there is an existing current instance of `IOLoop` when `make_current=True` is passed.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change from "is None" to "is not None"
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the code should now correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` is passed and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, preventing the error from being raised in cases where it should not.
