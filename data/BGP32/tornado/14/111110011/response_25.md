### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. If `make_current` is None, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, in which case it calls the `make_current` method.
3. If `make_current` is True, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if not, it sets the current `IOLoop`.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects it to be the current instance, then attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` expecting it to raise a RuntimeError since a second `make_current=True` construction cannot succeed.
5. The error message is obtained during the second attempt to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, where it expects the RuntimeError to be raised since the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` method checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance. It raises a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to raise a RuntimeError only if `make_current` is True and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it should set the current `IOLoop` based on the value of `make_current`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
