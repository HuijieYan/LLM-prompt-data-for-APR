### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, checking if it should be set as the current instance or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue is related to the logic inside the `initialize` function where the error is raised erroneously when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists, but the error is raised incorrectly due to the logic bug in the `initialize` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if no explicit value for make_current provided
    if make_current is None:
        # Check if there is no current instance, then make the current instance
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        # Check if make_current is True and a current instance exists, then raise an error
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        # If make_current is True and no current instance exists, then make the current instance
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the logic in the `initialize` function as provided above, the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
