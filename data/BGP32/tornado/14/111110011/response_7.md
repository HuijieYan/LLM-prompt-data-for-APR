### Error Analysis:
1. The initialize function in the `IOLoop` class checks for the current `IOLoop` instance by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If this check returns None, the function proceeds to make the current instance using `self.make_current()`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in the `IOLoopTest` class creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set it as the current instance. It then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True`, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test indicates that the first creation of the `IOLoop` instance is not being recognized as the current instance, leading to the `RuntimeError` in the subsequent creation attempt.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `IOLoop` instance created with `make_current=True` in the failing test is not correctly setting itself as the current instance. Therefore, when the second instance creation is attempted, it incorrectly sees no current instance and raises the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when an `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, it correctly sets itself as the current instance, allowing subsequent calls to `make_current=True` to raise the `RuntimeError` as expected.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if make_current is None or set to True
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        # If there is no current IOLoop instance, make this instance the current one
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        # If make_current is set to True but there is already a current instance, raise RuntimeError
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By modifying the logic within the `initialize` function to check both cases where `make_current is None` or `True`, and ensuring that the `IOLoop` instance correctly becomes the current instance when needed, we can fix the bug.

This corrected version should address the issue reported in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
