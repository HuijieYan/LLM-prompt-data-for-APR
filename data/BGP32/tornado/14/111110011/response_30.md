**Analysis:**
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for checking the current `IOLoop` instance and either making it the current instance or raising an error.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- The error message indicates that the check for the current `IOLoop` instance is causing the RuntimeError to be raised erroneously.

**Bug Cause:**
- The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in the `initialize` function's `elif` block. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and then it raises an error if it does. This logic is flawed because it should only raise the error if no current instance exists.
- The bug is related to discrepancy between the intended behavior (no current instance) and the actual behavior (current instance exists). This is causing the test to fail and the error to be raised.

**Fix Strategy:**
- To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition in the `elif` block of the `initialize` function. It should raise the error only if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This will align the logic with the expected behavior.

**Corrected Version:**
```python
# corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `initialize` function, the error in the failing test should be addressed, and the corrected function should now behave correctly.
