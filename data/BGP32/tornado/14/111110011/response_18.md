1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance with an optional parameter `make_current`. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is an existing current IOLoop instance before making itself the current instance. If the `make_current` parameter is provided and set to `True`, it again checks for an existing current IOLoop instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists.

2. Potential error locations within the buggy function:
The error is likely occurring when checking for an existing current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

3. Explanation of the bug:
The bug arises because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrect when checking for an existing current IOLoop instance. This condition should check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` rather than if it is `None`, as the existence of a current IOLoop instance is indicated when it's not `None`. Thus, the `RuntimeError` is being incorrectly raised when it shouldn't be.

4. Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the `initialize` function to check if a current IOLoop instance already exists, and adjust the logic accordingly.

5. Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the function now properly checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance, leading to the correct handling of the `make_current` parameter and preventing the erroneous `RuntimeError`.
