### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` checks if the `make_current` argument is None, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it calls the `make_current()` method. If `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is None, it raises a RuntimeError. This logic is causing the failure in the test case.
   
2. The test case `test_force_current()` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to become the current `IOLoop` instance. However, the buggy function logic does not handle this scenario correctly.

3. The error message indicates that the bug occurs at line 253 of `tornado/ioloop.py` where a RuntimeError is raised because the current `IOLoop` instance is None but the buggy logic expects it to be present when `make_current=True`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize()` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is None.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize()` function checks whether `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance is not None before raising a RuntimeError. This ensures that the behavior aligns with the expectations of the `test_force_current()` test case.

By making this change, the error raised due to the current incorrect logic should be resolved, and the test case should pass successfully.
