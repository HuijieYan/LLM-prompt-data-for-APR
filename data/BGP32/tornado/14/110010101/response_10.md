1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing.

2. Potential error locations:
The bug seems to be in the logic where the function checks if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the condition `if make_current:`, which correctly checks if `make_current` is `True`. However, in the subsequent block, the function tries to raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This logic is incorrect as it should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition within the `elif` block to only check for the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Check the value of make_current first
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise error only if make_current is True and there is already a current IOLoop
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
