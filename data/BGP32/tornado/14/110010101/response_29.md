### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class processes the `make_current` parameter to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The error message indicates that the error occurs when trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance when one is already present.
3. The current behavior of the buggy function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, tries to set the current instance based on the value of `make_current`. However, it does not handle the case where a current instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to handle the case where a current instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`. We can raise an error in this case.
5. We should modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance is already present when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix
Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None`, we ensure that an error is raised if a current `IOLoop` instance is already present when trying to force setting it as the current instance.

Now, the corrected function will properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
