## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and then either sets the current instance or raises an error.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. In this case, the function incorrectly raises an error when it should not.
3. The buggy function tries to enforce that only one current `IOLoop` instance exists at a time. However, in this specific case, the check is preventing the expected behavior from occurring.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to allow setting the current `IOLoop` instance even if a current instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

## Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        # Remove the check for existing current IOLoop instance
        self.make_current()
```

By removing the check for the existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`, the corrected function will always set the current instance regardless of any existing instances. This fix will address the bug described in the failing test.
