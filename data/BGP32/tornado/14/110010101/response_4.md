### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists.
4. The bug occurs because the condition to check if a current `IOLoop` exists is incorrect, leading to the exception being raised incorrectly.
5. The bug can be fixed by changing the condition to check if a current `IOLoop` exists more efficiently.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition checking for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By checking if the current instance is not `None` and is not the same as `self`, we ensure that the exception is only raised if a different instance is already set as the current `IOLoop`.
