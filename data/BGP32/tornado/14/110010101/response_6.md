### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is None before making the current `IOLoop`, but it is raising an error if `make_current` is True and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. 
2. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when the current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The intent seems to be to make the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and it does not exist. However, the condition to raise an error is not appropriate.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to only raise an error if `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Otherwise, it should proceed to make the current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Check if `make_current` is True and if an `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. If `make_current` is True and no `IOLoop` instance exists, proceed to make the current `IOLoop`.
3. If `make_current` is None, only make the current `IOLoop` if no instance already exists.
4. Ensure that the logic handles all cases correctly.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods and attributes
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will correctly raise an error if `make_current` is True and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, as expected.
