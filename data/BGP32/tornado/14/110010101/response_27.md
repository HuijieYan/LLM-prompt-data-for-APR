1. **Issues with the buggy function:**
    - The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists before making the current instance. However, the check for an existing instance is inconsistent and leads to the error message "current IOLoop already exists".
  
2. **Explanation of the bug:**
    - The `initialize` function checks for an existing `IOLoop` instance with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks for an existing instance before making the current instance. This inconsistency causes the error when `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

3. **Proposed strategy for fixing the bug:**
    - Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check for an existing instance based on the value of `make_current` parameter.
    - If `make_current` is `True`, raise an error if an instance already exists. Otherwise, make the current instance.
  
4. **Corrected version of the function:**
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By using the provided corrected version of the function, the error message "current IOLoop already exists" should be resolved, and the function will behave as expected.
