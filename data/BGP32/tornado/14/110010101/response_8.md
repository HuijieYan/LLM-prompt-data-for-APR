The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` is intended to initialize an instance of `IOLoop` with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`. The bug occurs when attempting to set the `make_current` option to `True`, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.

### Error:
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function first checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there isn't, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is no current instance and `make_current` is `True`, we should simply make the instance the current one.

### Corrected Version:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):    
    # Corrected function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the corrected version of the function should now properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance.
