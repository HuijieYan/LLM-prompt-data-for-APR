### Analysis
1. **Bug Description**: The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it needs to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before making itself the current one. However, the current implementation always tries to set itself as the current instance, leading to the error message indicating that a current `IOLoop` already exists.
   
2. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `initialize` function where it should be checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to set itself as the current instance.

3. **Bug Cause**: The buggy function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: 
    - Modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before deciding to make itself the current instance when `make_current` is `True`.
    - If a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, do not raise an error but handle it accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not self:
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the function will now check if a current `IOLoop` instance is already set before trying to set itself as the current instance when `make_current` is `True`. It will only set current if there is no current `IOLoop` instance or if the current instance is not itself.
