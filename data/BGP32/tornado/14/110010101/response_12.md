1. **Analysis**:
   - The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
   - The function is supposed to handle the initialization of an IO loop, with an option to make the current IO loop. 
   - The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` claiming that the current IO loop already exists.
   - The expected behavior is that when `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current IO loop if none exists, and if one already exists, it should not raise an error.

2. **Identified Error**:
   - The bug lies in the conditions for `make_current`. It checks if the current IO loop instance is `None`, which may lead to the incorrect error message.

3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The bug occurs because the current IO loop instance is checked for existence with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which may return `None` even if a current instance exists due to the argument `instance=False`.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**:
   - Update the check for the current IO loop instance to ensure that it correctly identifies if a current instance exists or not.

5. **Corrected Version**:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=True)  # Check for current instance correctly
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:  # Check if a current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
