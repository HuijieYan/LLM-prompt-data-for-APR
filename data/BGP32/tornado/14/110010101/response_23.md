### Explanation
The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, but it is not properly handling the case where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

In the failing test, when `make_current=True`, the function is correctly checking if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, instead of allowing the function to set itself as the current `IOLoop` if there is no current instance, it is raising an error when there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. This leads to the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function so that when `make_current=True`, it sets the current `IOLoop` instance only if there is no current instance already. If there is already a current instance, it should not raise an error.

### The corrected version of the initialize function

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the function will only set itself as the current `IOLoop` instance if there is no current instance when `make_current=True`. This will prevent the `RuntimeError` from occurring.
