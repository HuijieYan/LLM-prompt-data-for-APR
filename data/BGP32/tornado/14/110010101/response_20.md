### Analysis
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method inside the `IOLoop` class. It is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is True.
2. The error occurs when `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None, which means a current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The bug is caused by not checking if a current `IOLoop` already exists before trying to set it again in the `initialize` method.
4. To fix the bug, we should first check if a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is True. If it exists, we should not set it again and instead raise an error.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other class methods
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By adding the `if IOLoop.current() is not None` condition in the `elif make_current` block, we can prevent the function from setting the current `IOLoop` if it already exists. This should fix the bug and prevent the `RuntimeError` from occurring.
