### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`.
2. The bug occurs when trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance when one is already set.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect condition when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to set a new one.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should modify the condition that checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. If there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, we should not set a new one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None: 
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected condition to check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
