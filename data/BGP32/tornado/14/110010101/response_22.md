### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is `True`, and raise an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists.
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when trying to make the current `IOLoop` even though it already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` already exists is incorrect, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to correctly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to set it.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to set it, the issue of raising a RuntimeError when the current instance already exists is resolved.
