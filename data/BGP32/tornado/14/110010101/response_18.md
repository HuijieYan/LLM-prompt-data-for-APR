### Analysis
1. The buggy function, `initialize`, is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, the function is incorrectly checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and raising an error if it does.
3. The function should only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, not if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check in the `elif` block of the function.
5. To fix the bug, we need to remove the condition that checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Suggested Fix
1. Modify the `elif` block to only check if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.
2. Remove the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
