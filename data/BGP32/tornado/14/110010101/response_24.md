### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't exist and the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.
2. The failing test is indicating that an error is raised saying "current IOLoop already exists", suggesting that the current `IOLoop` instance is already set when it shouldn't be.
3. The bug occurs because the condition in the `initialize` function is incorrect. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, which is the opposite of what is intended.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition based on the logic we want to achieve.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug fix strategy involves changing the condition used to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
