1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is set to True, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating "current IOLoop already exists".

2. The potential error location is in the condition `if make_current:` where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition `if make_current:` should actually be checking if `make_current` is `True` and if a current instance of `IOLoop` does not exist, rather than the other way around. The current implementation checks for the wrong condition.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition `if make_current:` to check `if make_current is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to ensure that the `IOLoop` is only made current if it doesn't already exist.

5. Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is True:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

This corrected version should fix the bug in the function.
