### Analysis
1. **Buggy Function Explanation**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should make the current instance the current one, unless there is already a current `IOLoop`. If there is an existing current instance and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. **Error Location**: The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True`, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the function attempts to make the current instance the current one, resulting in the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

3. **Bug Cause**: The cause of the bug is that the logic to check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` as per the expected behavior. However, the current implementation tries to change the current instance, causing the error.
   
4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug**: To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
