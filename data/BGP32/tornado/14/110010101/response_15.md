1. **Analysis:**
   - The buggy function is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
   - The purpose of the `initialize` function is to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
   - The error message indicates that if `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.
  
2. **Identified Bug:**
   - The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.

3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - In the current implementation of the function, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, it should raise a `RuntimeError`, but instead it attempts to make the current loop without raising the error explicitly.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - To fix the bug, we need to explicitly raise the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

5. **Corrected Version of the Function:**

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
