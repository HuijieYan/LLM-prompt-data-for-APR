### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is specified.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.

### Bug Explanation
When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is none, it successfully sets itself as the current instance. However, if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise an error but instead raises the error message `"current IOLoop already exists"`. This happens because the conditional branch for the check is incorrect.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, the conditional branch for checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists should be modified. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, it should raise an error. The corrected condition should be `if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
