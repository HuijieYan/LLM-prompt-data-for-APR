## Analysis

### Buggy Function
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance. It takes an optional parameter `make_current`, which should be a boolean indicating whether the current IOLoop instance should be set as the current one.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` saying "current IOLoop already exists."

### Error Message
The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" in the failing test for the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Expected Output
When `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, the expected behavior should be to set the current IOLoop instance as the current one, without raising an error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is no current IOLoop instance. If there is already a current IOLoop instance and `make_current=True`, we should simply set it as the current instance.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if existing_instance is not None:
            existing_instance.make_current()
        else:
            self.make_current()
```
