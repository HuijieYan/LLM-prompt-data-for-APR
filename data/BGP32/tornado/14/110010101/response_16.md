The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True and raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. However, there is a bug in the logic of checking for the current instance, which causes the error message to be raised even when there is no current instance.

### Bug Explanation:
Currently, the bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks whether there is a current `IOLoop` instance by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. The expected behavior of the `current` method is to return the current `IOLoop` instance or None if there isn't one. However, the bug arises from the incorrect usage of the `instance` parameter in `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, leading to the error being raised erroneously.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the function to correctly check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is True. This can be achieved by modifying the logic to correctly handle the case where there is no current instance. We can accomplish this by first checking if there is a current instance, and only then making it current.

### Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class implementation details here...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the usage of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `IOLoop.current(instance=True)`, we ensure that the function correctly checks for the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test case specified.
