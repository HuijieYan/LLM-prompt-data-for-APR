## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is attempting to set the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`. However, it checks if there is already a current instance before making itself current.
2. In the failing test, the error message states that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
3. The cause of the bug lies in the logic check for an existing current instance of `IOLoop`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that it only tries to become the current instance if there is no current instance present.
   

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Update the `initialize` function to only set the current instance if there is no current instance already present.
2. Remove the check for an existing current instance when `make_current=True`.
3. Simplify the logic to avoid unnecessary checks and ensure correct behavior.



## The corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the function will correctly handle setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`.
