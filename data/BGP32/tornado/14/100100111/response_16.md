### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for ensuring there is only one current IOLoop object available. It checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and calls `make_current` if not, otherwise raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new current IOLoop object with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another one which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug occurs when the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked, and if it is None, an attempt is made to call `self.make_current()` and then raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. The issue seems to stem from a confusion regarding whether the current IOLoop instance should be `None` or not.
5. The buggy function needs to be modified to handle the case where the current IOLoop instance is already created and to avoid raising a `RuntimeError` in that scenario.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when the current IOLoop instance already exists. We should only call `make_current()` if `make_current` parameter is True and there is no current IOLoop instance. If there is already a current instance when `make_current` is True, it should not raise an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the corrected `initialize` function should now correctly handle the scenario where the current IOLoop object already exists when `make_current` is True. The function will only create a new instance if there is no current instance or if `make_current` is explicitly set to True.
