### 1. Analyze the buggy function and test code, the expected input/output values, the GitHub issue:
- The buggy function `initialize` checks if the current IOLoop instance exists and then potentially calls `make_current()` to set it as the current IOLoop instance.
- The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, checks if it is the current instance, tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` (which should fail with a `RuntimeError`), and then checks if the initial instance is still the current one.
- The GitHub issue questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### 2. Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
- The condition where `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### 3. Explain the cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the `initialize` function mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, implying that no current IOLoop instance exists.

### 4. Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
- The `initialize` function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.
- If `make_current` is `None` or `False`, then `make_current()` should be called to set the instance. 

### 5. Provide a corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to check if `current_instance is not None` when `make_current` is `True`, the corrected function will now only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is an existing current IOLoop instance when attempting to set it again as the current instance.
