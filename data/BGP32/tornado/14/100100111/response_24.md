Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. Missing a check for the existing instance of the current IOLoop before attempting to make it the current instance.
2. Incorrect logic for handling the `make_current` argument, causing the RuntimeError to be raised even when the IOLoop instance is not yet created.

Cause of the bug:
The buggy function fails due to incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument. The issue arises because it fails to check the existing instance of the current IOLoop properly before attempting to make it the current instance. As a result, the `RuntimeError` is raised, indicating that the current IOLoop already exists, even though this might not be the case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function checks if the current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make it the current instance. Additionally, the logic for handling the `make_current` argument needs to be revised to prevent raising the `RuntimeError` unnecessarily.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the function's logic to properly check for the existing instance of the current IOLoop before attempting to make it the current instance, the fix ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary and passes the failing test case provided.
