### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` has conditional statements checking the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug seems to be related to the logic of handling the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, ensures that the instance is current, then attempts to create another `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The function does not correctly throw an error when trying to create another `IOLoop` instance when one already exists.
4. To fix the bug, when `make_current=True` is specified, the function should check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

### Bug cause:
- The bug arises from not correctly handling the case when `make_current=True` is specified, and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- The current implementation only raises an error if `make_current=True`, but no `IOLoop` instance exists. However, it should also check if an `IOLoop` instance exists when attempting to make the current instance.

### Proposed fix:
- Modify the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True` is specified and raise a `RuntimeError` in that case.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By implementing this corrected version of the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case `test_force_current` should pass as expected.
