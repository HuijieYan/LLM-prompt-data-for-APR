### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` class, specifically the case where `make_current` is provided.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic within the `initialize` function when `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` highlights the issue where a RuntimeError is raised when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` despite the current loop already existing.
4. The expected behavior is that if an IOLoop instance already exists, attempting to create another one with `make_current=True` should raise an error.
5. The GitHub issue points out the specific point of confusion about the behavior of the code at line 252.

### Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the conditional statement where `make_current` is True if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None. 

### Cause of the Bug:
- In the buggy function, the code incorrectly allows the creation of multiple IOLoop instances even when an instance already exists and `make_current=True`.
- The bug occurs because the function should not allow the creation of a new IOLoop instance when an instance already exists unless `make_current` is explicitly set to `None`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To resolve the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to only create a new IOLoop instance if `make_current` is explicitly set to `None` or no instance currently exists.
- If `make_current` is set to `True` and an instance already exists, we should raise a RuntimeError to prevent the creation of a new instance.


### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the corrected `initialize` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case. It ensures that only one IOLoop instance is created when `make_current=True`, and any additional attempts will result in a RuntimeError.
