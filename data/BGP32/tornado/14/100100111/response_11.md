### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize an IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` attempts to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then verify that the instance is the current IOLoop and that a RuntimeError is raised when trying to create another current IOLoop instance.
3. The bug occurs when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when there is already an existing current IOLoop instance. The function does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance before proceeding with creating a new one.
5. Let's provide a corrected version of the `initialize` function to address this issue.

### Bug in the Buggy Function
The bug in the original `initialize` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current=True` parameter. When `make_current` is `True` and an existing current IOLoop instance is present, it incorrectly raises a RuntimeError even though it should proceed without any action.

### Correction Strategy
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we should adjust the conditional checks to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an existing current IOLoop instance is already present. We need to allow the function to proceed without raising a RuntimeError in this scenario.

### Corrected Function
```python
# The corrected function to replace the buggy one
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop already exists
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the corrected `initialize` function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case by allowing the creation of a new IOLoop instance without raising a RuntimeError when a current instance already exists.
