### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance with the current instance check. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. If `make_current` is `None` or `False`, it should just set the instance.
2. The bug seems to be with the handling of the `make_current` parameter when it is `True`.

### Error Location:
The error is in the block when `make_current` is `True`. It should check if the current instance exists before trying to create it again.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The function behaves unexpectedly by raising a `RuntimeError` even when it shouldn't.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check when `make_current` is `True` to only create the current instance if it does not already exist. If the current instance exists, then we should raise the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the error is only raised when the current IOLoop instance already exists.
