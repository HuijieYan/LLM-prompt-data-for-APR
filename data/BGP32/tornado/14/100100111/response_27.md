### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the file `ioloop.py` is responsible for initializing the IOLoop object with an option to force it to be the current IOLoop instance.
2. The issue arises when trying to initialize a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` when the current instance already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if the `make_current` parameter behaves correctly and throws a `RuntimeError` if trying to create a new current instance.
4. The bug causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even if the current IOLoop already exists.
  
### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is provided and needs to create a new current instance while one already exists, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even though the current loop exists due to missing a proper condition check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement when `make_current` is provided:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True`.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance does not exist, then create the new current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this adjustment to the conditional check, the function should now correctly handle creating the current IOLoop instance based on the provided `make_current` parameter.
