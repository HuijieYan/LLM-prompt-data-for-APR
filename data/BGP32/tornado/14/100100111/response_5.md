### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` has an issue that triggers a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, in the failing test `test_force_current`, the test logic expects this `RuntimeError` to be raised when a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`.

### Error locations
1. The condition check for `make_current` being `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already existing is not properly handled.

### Cause of the bug
The buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This behavior does not align with the expectations of the failing test, which requires the `RuntimeError` to be raised only when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `initialize` function to raise a `RuntimeError` only when a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True` and the current instance already exists.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the condition check in the `elif` block to ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised if `IOLoop.current()` is not `None`, we address the issue and update the logic to match the expectations of the failing test.
