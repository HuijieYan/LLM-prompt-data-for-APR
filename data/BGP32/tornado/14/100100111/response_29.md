### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file has a logical error in the condition checking. The function is supposed to ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, then the current `IOLoop` instance should not already exist; otherwise, it should create the current `IOLoop` instance.

The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with the same parameter, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as specified in the test.

The issue on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the logic at line 252 of the `ioloop.py` file, which seems to be the line related to the `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` condition.

### Error Location:
The logical error in the `initialize` function lies in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` where it should ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is not already present before proceeding.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly handle the case where `make_current=True` is specified. It fails to correctly check whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before proceeding.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is not already present before creating a new one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `else` block to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` and raising a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, we fix the bug and ensure that only one current `IOLoop` instance can exist when `make_current=True`.
