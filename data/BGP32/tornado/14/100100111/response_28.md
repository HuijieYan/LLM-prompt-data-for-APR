### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function has an issue where it is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. The conditional checks for `make_current` being `None` or `True` but doesn't handle the situation where it is `False`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to ensure that constructing a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug occurs due to the incomplete conditional checks in the `initialize` function. When a new `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True`, it should only succeed if no current `IOLoop` instance already exists. Otherwise, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional checks to handle all possible cases of `make_current` being `None`, `True`, or `False`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_io_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_io_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adding a check for `make_current` being `False` and optimizing the use of the `current_io_loop` variable, the function can now correctly handle the initialization of a new `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test case provided.
