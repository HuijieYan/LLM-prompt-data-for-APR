### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is responsible for initializing an IOLoop instance with an optional `make_current` flag, which determines whether the newly created instance should be set as the current IOLoop instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if the `make_current` flag is properly handled. It constructs an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to construct another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug seems to occur because the logic to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and the logic to handle the `make_current` flag are not properly synchronized in the buggy function.

### Potential error locations:
1. The check for an existing current IOLoop instance.
2. Handling the `make_current` flag logic.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`, but there is no existing current IOLoop instance. This check is unnecessary because the purpose of setting `make_current=True` is to make the newly constructed instance the current IOLoop instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic to only check for an existing current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is not specified.
2. When `make_current=True`, always set the newly created instance as the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as above, the corrected version ensures the expected behavior based on the provided failing test and resolves the GitHub issue related to the unnecessary `RuntimeError` being raised.
