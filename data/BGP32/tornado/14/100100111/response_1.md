### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `ioloop.py` file is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object by setting it as the current instance if it doesn't exist. If `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if the `IOLoop` object is successfully constructed with `make_current=True` and then raises an error when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.

3. The bug occurs because the condition where `make_current=True` is being satisfied even if the current instance already exists, leading to the incorrect behavior of not raising an error when it should.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the section of the function where `make_current=True` is handled.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug arises from the fact that when `make_current=True`, it should only make the current instance if one doesn't exist. However, the current implementation does not check if a current instance already exists before trying to make it current, leading to the issue where multiple instances are erroneously allowed.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for `make_current=True` to check if a current instance already exists before making it current. If a current instance already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError`. 

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current() 
```

Applying the fix above should resolve the bug and enable the corrected function to satisfy the expected input/output values and pass the failing test.
