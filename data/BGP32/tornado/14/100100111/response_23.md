### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance and make it the current instance if `make_current` is specified as `True`. The bug occurs when a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, and it raises a `RuntimeError` even though the current `IOLoop` instance is already `None`.

### Error Locations
1. The logic within the `elif make_current` block is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

### Cause of the Bug
When `make_current=True` is specified in the test case, the buggy function's logic incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if the `IOLoop.current()` is `None` (no current `IOLoop` instance), leading to the test failure and mismatch in the expected output.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should adjust the logic within the `elif make_current` block to only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and the new instance is created with `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the logic ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance and a new instance is being created with `make_current=True`. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test case pass.
