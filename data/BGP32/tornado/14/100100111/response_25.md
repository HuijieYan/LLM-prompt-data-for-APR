### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` checks the current instance of `IOLoop` and calls `make_current` if it is not already set. However, there seems to be an issue where it raises a `RuntimeError` incorrectly when `make_current` is set to `True`. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` checks this behavior and expects the `RuntimeError` to be raised under certain conditions.

### Identify Potential Error
The potential error in the `initialize` function is likely with the logic branching when `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug
- The buggy function's `initialize` method, when `make_current` is `True`, incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` expects the `RuntimeError` to be raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function.
- Consider only raising the `RuntimeError` if the `IOLoop.current` instance is not `None` and `make_current` is set to `True`.
- Ensure that the `make_current` method is called regardless of the current instance status when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above change, the corrected `initialize` function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and satisfy the expected input/output criteria.
