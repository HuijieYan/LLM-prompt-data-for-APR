### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is expected to initialize the IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter. The issue reported on GitHub points to a problem where the function raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which seems contradictory. 
2. The potential error location in the function is the comparison and handling of the `make_current` parameter.
3. The cause of the bug is that the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which contradicts the expected behavior. This causes the failing test case where the second construction attempt with `make_current=True` raises an error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic handling `make_current` and ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when `make_current` is `True` and IOLoop already exists. Otherwise, it should handle the initialization without an error.
5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition for raising `RuntimeError` to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the error is only raised when an IOLoop instance already exists.
