### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to handle the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is checking the behavior of creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and ensuring that an exception is raised when trying to create another one.
3. The bug occurs due to the logic in the `initialize` function not correctly handling the situation when `make_current=True` after an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The issue on GitHub questions the behavior of the function when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` but still raises an error.
  
### Error:
The bug in the `initialize` function causes it to raise a `RuntimeError` even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the failing test.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None` but `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- In the `elif make_current:` block, we check if `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` is not `None` before raising an error. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an `IOLoop` instance actually exists.
- This adjustment addresses the bug and ensures that the failing test `test_force_current` will pass as expected.
