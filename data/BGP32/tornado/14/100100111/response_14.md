### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if `make_current` is None and if `IOLoop.current()` is None, then calling `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is True, there is a redundant check for `IOLoop.current()` being None.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is checking if a new `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, and then trying to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug is caused by the redundant check for `IOLoop.current()` being None when `make_current` is True. This check results in raising a `RuntimeError` even if `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant check for `IOLoop.current()` being None when `make_current` is True.

### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if `IOLoop.current()` is not None when `make_current` is True, we can fix the bug. This modification ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current `IOLoop` already exists.
