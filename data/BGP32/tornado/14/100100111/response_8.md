Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. In the `if make_current is None` block:
   - The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` will always evaluate to True, as the function `IOLoop.current()` will always return None due to the instance parameter being set to False. This condition is incorrect and will lead to incorrect behavior.
   
2. In the `elif make_current` block:
   - The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is also incorrect, as it will always be True, leading to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by incorrect conditions in the `initialize` function. The conditions checking for the current `IOLoop` instance are flawed because of the way the `IOLoop.current()` function is called.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` as it is not needed for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. Use a different approach to determine if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current() is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By modifying the condition checks and directly calling `IOLoop.current()` without specifying the `instance` parameter, we ensure the correct behavior of the `initialize` function as per the expected functionality and test cases.
