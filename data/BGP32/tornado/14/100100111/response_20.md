Potential error locations in the buggy function:
1. When `make_current` is not None and is True, the function checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If it does, a `RuntimeError` is raised claiming that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

Explanation of the bug:
- In the failing test `test_force_current`, the initial `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`. This sets the current `IOLoop`.
- In the test, a second `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` due to the implementation in the buggy function.
- However, the current implementation of the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if an existing `IOLoop` instance is found when `make_current=True` is used.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic of the function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. This will align the function with the expected behavior outlined in the failing test case.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_io_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_io_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By incorporating the above changes in the function, it should now pass the failing test case and align with the expected behavior.
