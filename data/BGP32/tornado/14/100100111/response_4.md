### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance.
2. The test function `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` checks the behavior when trying to construct a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The buggy function is causing an unexpected behavior when a second call to initialize the IOLoop with `make_current=True` is made.
4. The expected behavior is to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current IOLoop instance already exists.
5. The current implementation fails to handle this case properly.

### Error Location:
The issue lies in the logic that checks for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and the subsequent actions.
There is a missing check to see if `make_current` flag is set to `True` before raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is in the conditional logic of the `initialize` function. It does not properly check if `make_current` is `True` before raising a `RuntimeError`. As a result, the `RuntimeError` is raised even when the `make_current` flag is not set to `True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# A corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the correction to check if `make_current` is `True` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected outcome in the test case provided.
