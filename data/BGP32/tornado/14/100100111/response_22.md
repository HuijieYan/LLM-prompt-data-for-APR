### Analysis
1. The buggy function, `initialize`, is designed to set the current IOLoop instance if it does not already exist. It checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current instance is `None`, then it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` when the current instance already exists.
2. The failing test, `test_force_current`, tests the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and ensures that `IOLoop` instance cannot be created if one already exists.
3. The bug occurs in the `initialize` function because it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if the current instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, the condition to raise `RuntimeError` should be changed so that it only raises an error when the current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the buggy function `initialize` to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None`.
2. Update the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter correctly based on the expected behavior.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Bug-fixed version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the modifications above, the buggy function should now behave as expected and pass the failing test case provided.
