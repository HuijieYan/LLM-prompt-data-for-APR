The bug in the `initialize` function is that it incorrectly checks for the condition to raise a `RuntimeError`. The `initialize` function should raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. However, in the buggy implementation, it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and no current `IOLoop` instance exists.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to properly validate the existing `IOLoop` instance before raising a `RuntimeError`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` block, we ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This fix should make the buggy function behave correctly and pass the failing test case.
