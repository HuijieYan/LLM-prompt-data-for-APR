## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance, setting it as the current instance if needed.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The buggy function fails the test `test_force_current` as it does not correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` is passed, it correctly sets the current `IOLoop` instance and appropriately handles the case where there is already a current instance.

## Bug Explanation
1. In the failing test `test_force_current`, when `make_current=True` is passed to the `IOLoop` constructor, it expects a new `IOLoop` instance to be created and set as the current instance.
2. The current bug in the `initialize` function fails to correctly handle this scenario. It does not set the `IOLoop` instance as the current one when `make_current=True` is passed. This results in the test failing with an unexpected `RuntimeError`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, it correctly sets the `IOLoop` instance as the current one. We need to update the logic to handle this case properly.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # other functions in the class remain the same

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the scenario when `make_current=True` is passed and ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is set appropriately.
