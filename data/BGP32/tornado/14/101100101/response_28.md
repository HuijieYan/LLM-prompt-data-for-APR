## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic error. It checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` parameter is `None`, but it fails to handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. The `test_force_current` test case expects that when `make_current` is `True`, a new `IOLoop` instance is created and set as the current instance, raising an error if there is already a current instance.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should create a new `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance, but the existing implementation does not handle this case.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We should create a new `IOLoop` instance and set it as the current instance if there is no current instance already. If there is already a current instance and `make_current` is `True`, we should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the test case.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
