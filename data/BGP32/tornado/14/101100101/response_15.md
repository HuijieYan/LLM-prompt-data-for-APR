### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. Currently, it is not properly checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to set itself as the current instance. This results in the test function `test_force_current` failing when it tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

### Bug explanation
1. The `initialize` function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance, the function should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The function should only set itself as the current `IOLoop` instance if there is no existing one and `make_current` is either `None` or `True`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to:
1. Check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.
2. Only set itself as the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is either `None` or `True` and there is no existing current instance.

### Corrected function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and prevent the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance if there is already a current one.
