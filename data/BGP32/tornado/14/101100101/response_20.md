The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It doesn't prevent the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance when one already exists, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one when `make_current` is `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will prevent the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance if one already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided.
