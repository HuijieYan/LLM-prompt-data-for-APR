### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object. The issue arises when trying to enforce the `make_current` parameter, causing the test `test_force_current` to fail. The bug occurs in the logic that checks the current status of the `IOLoop` object before initializing a new one.

### Bug Explanation
The bug lies in the conditional logic within the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the function should raise an error if an `IOLoop` object already exists. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to the test failure.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `initialize` function properly handles the case where an `IOLoop` object is already in existence when `make_current=True`. We can fix this by checking if an `IOLoop` object already exists before attempting to create a new one.

### Corrected Code
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
      
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

# The corrected version of the function has been included above.
```  

By making the suggested correction in the `initialize` function, the issue should be resolved, and the failing test case should pass with the corrected logic.
