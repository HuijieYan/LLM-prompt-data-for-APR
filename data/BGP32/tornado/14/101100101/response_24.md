The bug in the `initialize` function is that when `make_current` is provided as `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an existing `IOLoop` instance is already set as current. However, the current implementation only checks for the existence of an `IOLoop` instance without checking if it is already set as current.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to check if the existing `IOLoop` instance is already set as current using the `IOLoop.current()` method.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None:
                if current_instance is not self:
                    raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function checks if an existing `IOLoop` instance is already set as the current instance when `make_current` is provided as `True` and raises a `RuntimeError` if needed.
