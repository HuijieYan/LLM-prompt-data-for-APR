The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance by setting the current instance if it is not already set. However, the bug in the function lies in the logic for checking the current instance before making it current or raising an error.

### Cause of the Bug:
1. In the conditional checks, both branches will execute `self.make_current()` if the current instance is None, leading to the current instance being set in both branches.
2. In the `elif` branch, if `make_current` is True, it does not correctly handle the case where the current instance already exists, which results in setting the instance again without raising an error.

### Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, I will modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where the current instance already exists and follow the expected logic.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle setting the current instance based on the provided `make_current` parameter.
