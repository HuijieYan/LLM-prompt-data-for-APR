### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object, including making it the current IOLoop if necessary.
- The bug occurs when trying to create a new IOLoop object with `make_current=True` while there is already an existing current IOLoop object.
- The `initialize` function should check if there is already a current IOLoop object before making a new one.
- The current implementation does not handle the case where a new IOLoop object is created with `make_current=True` when there is already a current IOLoop object, leading to the RuntimeError exception being incorrectly raised.

### Bug:
The bug is in the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current=True`, it first checks if there is no current IOLoop object, and then proceeds to make the current one. However, it does not consider the case where there is already a current IOLoop object, leading to the RuntimeError exception being incorrectly raised.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current IOLoop object before making a new one when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where a new IOLoop object is created with `make_current=True` when there is already a current IOLoop object.
