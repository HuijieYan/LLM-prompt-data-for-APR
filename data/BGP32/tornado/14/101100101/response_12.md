### Explanation of the bug
The buggy function `initialize` is not correctly handling the case where `make_current` is set to `True`. In the failing test `test_force_current`, when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, the function should check if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, set the current IOLoop to the one being initialized. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` function is not checking for the `make_current` value correctly, leading to the RuntimeError not being raised when it should.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`. Specifically, we need to ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, and an IOLoop instance already exists, a RuntimeError is raised. Otherwise, if an instance does not yet exist, the current IOLoop should be set to the newly initialized one.

### Corrected version of the function

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function is corrected to ensure that the current IOLoop instance is properly managed.
