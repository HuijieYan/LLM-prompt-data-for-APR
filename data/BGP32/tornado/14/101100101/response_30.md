## Bug Description
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a logic error in handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if it exists. However, if the instance already exists, it tries to call `self.make_current()` again, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter. When `make_current` is `True`, we should directly call `self.make_current()` without checking if an instance already exists. This will ensure that the `make_current` operation is performed correctly.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function in this way, the logic around the `make_current` parameter is corrected to ensure that the `make_current()` operation behaves as expected. The corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
