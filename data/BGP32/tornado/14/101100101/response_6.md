## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is meant to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs when trying to initialize with `make_current=True` after already having a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The bug is caused by the check for a current `IOLoop` instance in the `initialize` function not correctly handling the scenario where `make_current=True` is passed.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to check whether a current `IOLoop` instance is already set before setting a new one when `make_current=True` is specified.

## Solution
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` is used, especially when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_ioloop is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_ioloop:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.

Now, the provided failing test for the `test_force_current` function should pass with the corrected `initialize` function.
