## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
2. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and calls `make_current` if it is.
3. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and raises an error if it is not.

## Bug Explanation
1. The bug occurs in the logic handling the `make_current` parameter.
2. In the failing test, the `test_force_current` function explicitly sets `make_current` to `True` when creating an `IOLoop` instance.
3. However, the buggy function `initialize` does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` since it also checks for `None`.
4. This causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when `make_current` is `True` in the failing test case.

## Fix
1. Update the `initialize` function to directly check if `make_current` is `True` and handle it accordingly.
2. Remove the check for `None` when `make_current` is `True` to prevent the RuntimeError from being raised when it should not.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above changes, the corrected `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case.
