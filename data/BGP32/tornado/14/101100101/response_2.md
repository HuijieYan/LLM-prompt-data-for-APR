### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`. It fails to check whether an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current instance.

### Bug cause
1. The `initialize` function does not correctly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`. It raises a `RuntimeError` even though no instance exists.
2. The function does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an instance of IOLoop is already the current instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the buggy function, the following changes can be made:
1. Check if an existing instance of IOLoop is already current before trying to make the current instance.
2. If an instance of IOLoop is already current and `make_current` is `True`, skip making the instance current.

### Corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and an instance of IOLoop is already current. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
