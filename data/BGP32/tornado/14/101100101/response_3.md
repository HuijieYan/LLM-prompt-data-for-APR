The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic that checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one. The bug causes the RuntimeError to be raised even when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument.

The bug occurs because the condition `if make_current is None:` should be changed to `if make_current is not None:` to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` is passed.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function by changing the condition as mentioned above.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is not None:
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the function should pass the failing test case provided.
