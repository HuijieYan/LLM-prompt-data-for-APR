### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` has a condition where if `make_current` is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()`.
- The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True` is passed to `IOLoop`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` already exists.
- However, the buggy function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists, causing the test to fail.

### Bug
The bug in the current implementation is that it does not properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. It should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected in the failing test.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function such that it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists, and it should pass the failing test.
