## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to create a new IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance if no current instance exists. However, there is a bug in the logic where it checks for the current instance's existence. The bug is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail when trying to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.

## Bug Explanation
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to create a new IOLoop instance and set it as the current instance if `make_current` is set to `True`.
2. The bug occurs in the conditional check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If no instance currently exists, it should proceed to make the current instance the new IOLoop. However, the logic is incorrect and does not handle the scenario where a new IOLoop needs to be created.
3. When the failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, the bug prevents the new instance from being created as it incorrectly assumes an existing instance is already present.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the creation of a new IOLoop instance when needed. We should check if the current instance exists and only raise an exception if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`. Otherwise, the new instance should be made the current IOLoop.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic to correctly handle the creation of a new IOLoop instance, the corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test.
