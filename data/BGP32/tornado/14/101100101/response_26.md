## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it calls the `make_current` method.
2. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if it's `True`. If it is, and there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. However, the issue lies in the initialization logic. It should create a new `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance.
4. The failing test case `test_force_current` aims to verify that a second `make_current=True` construction cannot succeed.

## Bug Explanation
The bug in the `initialize` function is that it doesn't create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. This results in the failing test case because it expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the buggy function, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, we need to create a new instance. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case and behave as expected.
