## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. 
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the `make_current` parameter, as it should ensure that there is only one current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that attempting to create a second current `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `initialize` function correctly handles the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.

## Bug Explanation
1. The bug in the `initialize` function arises from not correctly handling the case where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The bug occurs because the function does not properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to set a new one.
3. In the failing test `test_force_current`, the second attempt to create a current `IOLoop` instance is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` since only one instance is allowed. However, due to the bug, this check is not being correctly performed.

## Fix Strategy
1. We need to modify the `initialize` function to accurately check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to set a new one.
2. If `make_current=True` is provided, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
3. Additionally, the function should check if a current instance exists when `make_current` is not provided and create one if it does not.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By making the suggested changes in the `initialize` function, the corrected version should fix the bug and pass the failing test.
