### Analysis:
The bug in the `initialize` function is related to the logic flow when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The error message clearly indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to initialize the IOLoop since the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for an existing current IOLoop instance is incorrect.
2. The conditional statements inside the function are not handling the `make_current` parameter appropriately.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and the current IOLoop instance already exists. The function attempts to create a new IOLoop instance even though one is already present.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
The buggy code should be modified to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one. If an instance already exists, it should not attempt to create another one and throw an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version, the function first checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is set to `True` and a current instance is found, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This approach ensures that a new IOLoop instance is only created when one does not already exist.
