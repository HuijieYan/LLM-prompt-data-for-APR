## Analysis:
The error message states that a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when the `initialize` function is called with `make_current=True`. This indicates that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluating to false, leading to the exception being raised.

## Bug Location:
The issue is with the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which should be checking if the current IOLoop instance exists, but the condition is causing the opposite behavior.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checking for the absence of an IOLoop instance, but it should be checking for the presence of an instance. This leads to the wrong behavior in deciding whether to raise the `RuntimeError` or not.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition so that it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists. This can be achieved by changing the condition from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`.

## Updated/Copied & Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction to the conditional statement, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test without raising a `RuntimeError`.
