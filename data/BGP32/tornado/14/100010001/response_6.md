### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set up the current IOLoop instance during initialization.
- The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised with the message "current IOLoop already exists".

### Error Location:
- The issue is with the conditional check for `make_current` being `True` when the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the current IOLoop instance already exists. In this case, the function attempts to set up the IOLoop again, leading to a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- We should modify the conditions inside the `initialize` function to only create a new IOLoop instance if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance does not already exist.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed the condition to directly capture the make_current = True case
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- If `make_current` is `None`, it will check if the current IOLoop instance exists and update it if needed.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it will check if an IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, it will raise a `RuntimeError`, otherwise, it will proceed to make the current IOLoop.
