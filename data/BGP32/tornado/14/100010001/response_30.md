The buggy function `initialize` is causing the error message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance is already present. This error occurs because the function is not correctly checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists before either creating a new one or raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function first checks for the current IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. If `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` as expected. This ensures that the function behaves correctly and passes the failing test.
