## Analysis:
- The error message indicates that the test is failing because a RuntimeError is being raised when a current IOLoop already exists.
- The bug is likely related to the logic in the `initialize` function, specifically in the `make_current` condition handling.

## Bug:
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. 
- The `initialize` function does not handle this case properly, resulting in a RuntimeError being raised.

## Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if the current IOLoop exists before attempting to make it current.
- If `make_current` is true and the current IOLoop already exists, we should simply return without raising the RuntimeError.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            return  # Current IOLoop already exists, do nothing
        self.make_current()
```
