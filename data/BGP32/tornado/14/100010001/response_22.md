The buggy function `initialize` is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". The cause of this bug is that the function is checking whether an IOLoop instance already exists, but it is not handling the scenario where an IOLoop instance was explicitly created with `make_current=True`. In this case, the check for an existing IOLoop instance is causing the function to incorrectly raise an error.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic within the `initialize` function to handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance is explicitly created with `make_current=True`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, the function will now correctly raise an error only when an IOLoop instance exists and `make_current` is explicitly set to `True.
