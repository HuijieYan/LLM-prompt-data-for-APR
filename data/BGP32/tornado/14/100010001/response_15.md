### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the `initialize` method is raising a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists." This error occurs specifically in the `test_force_current` method when attempting to force the creation of a current `IOLoop`. This suggests that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the function is not handling this case appropriately.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Handling of the `make_current` argument when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument when checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists. The logic should prevent the new `IOLoop` instance from being created if there is already a current instance existing. However, the current implementation is not handling this situation correctly, which leads to the `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that:
1. If a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is True, an error should be raised.
2. If `make_current` is None and there is already a current instance, the `make_current()` method should not be called.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists based on the `make_current` argument.
