## Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function is throwing a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". This error occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current()` already exists, which should not be the case according to the function logic.

## Location of Error:
The error is occurring at the line where `RuntimeError` is being raised, specifically when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. The code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` before raising the `RuntimeError`, which is not the intended behavior when `make_current` is `True`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition check when `make_current` is `True`. We should raise the `RuntimeError` only when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.

## Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # fix the condition check for make_current=True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition check in the function, the bug should be resolved and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
