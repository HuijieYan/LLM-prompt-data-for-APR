### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is being called with `make_current=True` in the failing test, which results in the error message indicating that the current IOLoop already exists.
2. The `initialize` method checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if `make_current` is `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`.
3. The error message indicates that the current IOLoop already exists when attempting to force it as the current instance.
4. The bug is likely due to the `make_current` flag being passed as `True` without checking if an existing instance is already the current IOLoop.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised to only do so if an existing IOLoop instance is currently created and registered as the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if self in IOLoop._current_instance_stack:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, we check if the current `self` instance is in the `_current_instance_stack` to determine if an existing IOLoop instance is already set as the current instance, preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised erroneously.
