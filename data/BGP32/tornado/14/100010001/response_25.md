The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is causing a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True` is passed. The error message indicates that the issue is with checking if the current IOLoop already exists.

### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function receives a parameter `make_current`, which is used to determine whether to make the current IOLoop instance.
- The bug occurs when `make_current=True`, and the function tries to create a new IOLoop instance when one already exists.

### Bug Cause:
- The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, it should not create a new IOLoop instance if one already exists.

### Bug Fix:
To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance.

This change ensures that if `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` will be raised to indicate that the current IOLoop instance is already present.
