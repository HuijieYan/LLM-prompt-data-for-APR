### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the function `initialize` is trying to force the creation of a new current `IOLoop` even though there is already one in existence. This is causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

### Error Location:
The error occurs when the condition `if make_current:` is met and the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to first check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to force the creation of a new one using the `make_current` method. If an `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current` is `True`, then we should not raise an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if not IOLoop.initialized():
            self.make_current()
``` 

By checking if an `IOLoop` is already initialized before creating a new one with `make_current`, we ensure the integrity of the process and the prevention of the `RuntimeError` that was previously occurring.
