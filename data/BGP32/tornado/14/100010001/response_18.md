## Analyzing the buggy function and error message:
- The `initialize` function checks if a current IOLoop instance exists and acts accordingly based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The error message shows that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` because it detects an existing current IOLoop instance. However, the test expects the function to initialize a new IOLoop even if one already exists.

## Potential error locations:
- The issue might be in the conditional check under `elif make_current:`. It raises an error when it should proceed to initialize a new IOLoop instance.

## Cause of the bug:
- The bug causes the `initialize` function to throw a `RuntimeError` when it detects an existing IOLoop instance, preventing the creation of a new IOLoop. This behavior conflicts with the test expectations.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to change the behavior of the function when `make_current` is `True`. Instead of raising an error if a current IOLoop exists, the function should proceed to initialize a new IOLoop instance.

## Corrected version of the initialize function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()  # Always create a new IOLoop instance when make_current is True
``` 

By modifying the `initialize` function as shown above, the function will proceed to initialize a new IOLoop instance even if one already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
