### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `ioloop.py` file is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists or not before making it the current instance. The error message indicates that the function is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but a current `IOLoop` instance is already present.

### Bug Identification:
The bug in the function lies in the logic where it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. When `make_current=True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. This is incorrect as the intention is to forcefully set the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the function to incorrectly identify an already existing `IOLoop` instance as an error, even though the intention was to directly set the current instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to remove the check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`. Instead, when `make_current=True`, we will directly set the current `IOLoop` instance without checking for its presence.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the problematic check for a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` has been removed. Now the function will directly set the current `IOLoop` instance without any additional checks when `make_current=True`. This change will fix the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
