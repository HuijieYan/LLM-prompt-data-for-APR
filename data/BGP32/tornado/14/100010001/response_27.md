### Analysis:
The error message indicates that the bug is related to the condition check for `make_current=True`. The error occurs when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None and the function still tries to make the loop current, which leads to the RuntimeError.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely located in the `initialize` function in the `tornado.ioloop.py` file, specifically in the block where `make_current=True` is checked.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is True, the function checks if the current IOLoop already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it does exist, a RuntimeError is raised, but the function still attempts to make the current loop even when it already exists.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, we need to update the logic for when `make_current=True`. If the current IOLoop already exists, the function should not attempt to make it current again.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the adjustment above, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test.
