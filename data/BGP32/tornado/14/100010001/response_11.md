### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class within the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance.
2. The error occurs when `make_current` is specified as `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is raised when trying to initialize a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when an instance already exists.
4. To fix this, we need to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before trying to force the creation of a new one.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`. If an instance is already present, we should not try to create a new one and instead handle this scenario gracefully without raising an error. 

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            return  # IOLoop instance already exists, do nothing
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes to the `initialize` function, the corrected version will check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one. If an instance is found when `make_current=True`, it will skip the creation of a new instance and continue without raising an error.
