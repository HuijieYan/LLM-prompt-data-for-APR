### Analysis:
The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is being raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, as it detects that a current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Bug Location:
The bug is likely within the `else` block of the `initialize` function. Specifically, the condition `elif make_current:` is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even if a current `IOLoop` does not exist.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because the `elif make_current:` condition checks whether `make_current` is `True`, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. This is contrary to the intended functionality where setting `make_current=True` should create a new `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should change the condition `elif make_current:` to `if make_current:`. This way, when `make_current=True`, a new `IOLoop` instance will always be created.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the suggested change, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, and not raise a `RuntimeError` when no other `IOLoop` instance exists.
