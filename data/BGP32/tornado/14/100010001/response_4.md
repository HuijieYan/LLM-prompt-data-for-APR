### Analysis:
1. The error message is indicating that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised.
2. The error is occurring in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The bug is in the logic implemented in the `initialize` function, which incorrectly raises an error when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. If an IOLoop instance already exists, do not raise an error because `make_current` is True and the current instance is expected.
3. Only raise an error if `make_current` is True and no IOLoop instance exists.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            return  # Do nothing if IOLoop instance already exists and make_current is True
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle the case when an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is True without raising an error.
