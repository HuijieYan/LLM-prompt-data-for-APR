### Analysis:
The function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is intended to initialize an `IOLoop` object with an option to make it the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when a current `IOLoop` already exists, contradicting the expectation.

### Identified Bug:
The bug lies in the logic of checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance. The function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance. This inconsistency leads to the failing test.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. The fix should ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function properly checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current` and raises a `RuntimeError` only when there is an existing instance.
