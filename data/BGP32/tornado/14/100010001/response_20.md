### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize the IOLoop object with an optional parameter `make_current`. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if an IOLoop object is already current and if not, it calls `self.make_current()` method. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if an IOLoop object is already current and raises an error if it is. However, the bug occurs when the provided `make_current` parameter is `True` and the current IOLoop already exists.

### Error Location:
The error occurs in the `initialize` function when the `make_current` parameter is `True` and an IOLoop object is already current, resulting in the `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if an IOLoop object is current before trying to make it current. If `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop object is already current, the function should raise an error, but instead, it tries to set the current IOLoop causing the error.

### Fix Strategy:
The strategy to fix this bug involves checking if `make_current` is `True` first and then checking if an IOLoop object is already current. If both conditions are met, then raise a `RuntimeError`. If `make_current` is `False` or not specified or if there is no current IOLoop object, proceed with setting the current IOLoop object.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and current_instance is None:
        self.make_current()
```
