## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` is not handling the logic correctly for checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance. The error message indicates that the current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

## Identified issue:
The logic in the `initialize` function is checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance incorrectly. It should only raise an error when `make_current=True` and the IOLoop instance already exists.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the error checking condition is checking for the existence of the IOLoop instance in both the `if make_current is None` and `elif make_current` conditions without differentiating between the two.

## Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, adjust the conditional logic to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and the IOLoop instance already exists. An error should not be raised when `make_current` is `None` or `False`.

## Corrected version of the function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now correctly handle the logic for creating a new IOLoop instance or raising an error if the instance already exists when `make_current=True`. This change should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
