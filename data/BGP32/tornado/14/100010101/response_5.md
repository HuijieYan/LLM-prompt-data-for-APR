### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object based on the `make_current` parameter. However, the bug occurs in the condition where `make_current` is `True`. It is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None` before setting the current IOLoop, leading to a RuntimeError if an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect check for an existing IOLoop instance. The function is raising a RuntimeError even when `make_current` is `True` and should set the current IOLoop instance.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we should remove the unnecessary check for an existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True` because the purpose of the `make_current` parameter is to explicitly set the current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

# the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
