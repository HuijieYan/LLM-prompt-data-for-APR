### Analysis
- The buggy function has a conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `True` and then raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
- The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is indeed being raised, suggesting that `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`.
- The expected behavior is for the function to create an `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` does not exist.
- The bug seems to be occurring because the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` call within the if condition is returning `None` even when it should not.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Check the implementation of `IOLoop.current` to understand why it might be returning `None`.
- Ensure that the logic for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is correct.
- Adjust the conditional statements to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition in the `elif` statement has been updated to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`. This change ensures that the correct behavior is followed when creating or checking for existing `IOLoop` instances.
