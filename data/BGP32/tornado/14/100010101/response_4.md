### Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. The error message indicates that the current instance is already existing, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current` is set to `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. We should check if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` in that case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
