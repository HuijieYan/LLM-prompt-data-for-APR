### Analysis
- The function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object and set it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is `True`.
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop existing, leading to a `RuntimeError`.
- The bug is caused by not checking whether a current IOLoop already exists before trying to make the IOLoop object current.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check if there is already a current IOLoop before attempting to make the IOLoop object current when `make_current` is `True`. If a current IOLoop exists, we should not try to make the IOLoop object current again.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)  # Get the current IOLoop
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
