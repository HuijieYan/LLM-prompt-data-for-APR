### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` takes a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean.
- The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, and the current `IOLoop` already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
- The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` already exists, the function should not try to create a new `IOLoop`.
- The issue seems to be with the logic to check if an `IOLoop` already exists before initializing a new one.

### Bug
The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` already exists. In this case, the function incorrectly tries to create a new `IOLoop`, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to check if an `IOLoop` already exists before attempting to initialize a new one. If an `IOLoop` already exists and `make_current` is `True`, we should not raise an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return  # Do not create a new IOLoop if one already exists
        self.make_current()
```
