### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current IOLoop instance exists and either create a new one or raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.
- The error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` indicates that the condition to raise an error is not working correctly.
- The expected behavior for this test case is to raise an error when `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

### Bug
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. The condition to raise the error is incorrect.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition for raising an error. We should raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an instance of IOLoop already exists.

### Code Correction
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the conditional check in the `initialize` function as mentioned above, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected function should now pass the failing test case.
