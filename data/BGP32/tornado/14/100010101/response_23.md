### Analysis
- The `initialize` function is designed to set up the current IOLoop, but the current implementation is causing a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is set to `True`.
- The bug is occurring because the function first checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and then if `make_current` is `True`, it throws an error if the current IOLoop is already set.
- The expected behavior should be to set the current IOLoop if it is `None`, regardless of the value of `make_current`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Remove the condition that checks if the current IOLoop is already set before setting it.
- Simply set the current IOLoop if it is `None`.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```
