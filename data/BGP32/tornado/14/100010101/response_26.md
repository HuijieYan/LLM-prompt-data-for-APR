### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` checks if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new IOLoop instance. 
- The error occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`, indicating that the caller wants the IOLoop to be the current one, but an existing current IOLoop is already present.
- The `initialize` method should only raise an error if `make_current` is` True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Bug in the Code
- The bug is in the `initialize` method logic. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if there is already a current IOLoop instance before creating a new one. If an existing current IOLoop instance is found, it should raise an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- Update the conditional check for `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current` is `True` and an existing current IOLoop instance is already present.
- The function should raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After applying the bug fix, the `initialize` method will correctly handle the scenario where `make_current` is `True` and an existing current IOLoop instance is present.
