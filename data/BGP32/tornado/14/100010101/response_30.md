1. Analyzing the buggy function, we can see that the issue lies in the logic where it checks for the current IOLoop instance. The error message indicates that when `make_current=True`, the function is raising a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.

2. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current=True`, the function should only check if the IOLoop instance already exists, not raise an error if it does. Instead, it should set the instance to the current IOLoop.

3. The bug occurs because the logic in the function is incorrect. It is raising an error when it should not and not setting the current IOLoop instance when it should.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the function to first check if the IOLoop instance exists. If it does, then set it as the current IOLoop. If it does not exist, then create a new IOLoop instance.

5. Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            self.current = current_instance
```
