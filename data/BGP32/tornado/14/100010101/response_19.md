### Analysis and Explanation
- The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an instance by checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
- The error message indicates that when trying to force the current `IOLoop` instance to exist, it is detecting that an instance already exists, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
- The expected behavior is that if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.
- The bug occurs because the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not properly performed in the case where `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, we check if an instance already exists. If it does, then raise a `RuntimeError`.
- We should modify the logic to handle the case properly where `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected function, the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is properly handled when `make_current` is `True`. Now, it will successfully raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
