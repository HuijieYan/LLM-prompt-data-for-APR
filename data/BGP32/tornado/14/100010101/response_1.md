### Analysis:
The buggy function is intended to initialize an IOLoop instance with the option to force it as the current IOLoop. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and the `IOLoop.current()` is not `None`, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised even if the current IOLoop does not exist.

### Bug:
When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, which should not trigger an error. This incorrect condition leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised when it is not justified.

### Fix:
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the conditional check for setting the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is `True`, we should only set the current IOLoop if it does not already exist. The corrected version of the function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
