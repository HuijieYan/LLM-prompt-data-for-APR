### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if so, it is raising a `RuntimeError`. However, the bug occurs when the function is trying to create a new instance of the `IOLoop` class, and it erroneously detects that a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when it shouldn't.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect way the condition is checked when `make_current` is `True`. The function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is an existing `IOLoop` instance and `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the current implementation raises an error if there is no existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to check if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. If there is, then we raise the `RuntimeError`, otherwise, we make the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if there is an existing IOLoop instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test case and correctly handle the creation of a new `IOLoop` instance.
