### Analysis
The buggy function has a conditional check that throws a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when it shouldn't.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect conditional check logic for when `make_current` is `True`. The function raises an error even if the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is not the intended behavior.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for the case where `make_current` is `True`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` does not exist.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix, the function should handle the cases correctly and pass the failing test.
