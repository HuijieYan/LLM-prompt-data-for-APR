## Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` has a logic error where it incorrectly checks for the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`. The intention seems to be to raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks the current IOLoop status when `make_current` is `True. It raises an error even if no IOLoop instance exists.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to only raise an error if `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists. Otherwise, it should create a new IOLoop instance.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    else:
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the case of `make_current` being `True`. This should fix the bug and pass the failing test case.
