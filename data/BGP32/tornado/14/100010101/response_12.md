### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and create a new one if needed. However, the bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug
The bug occurs because when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should create a new `IOLoop` instance only if the current instance does not already exist. However, the current logic checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, which is incorrect. This logic should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists instead.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `if make_current:` branch to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and only raise an error if it does. We should remove the unnecessary check for `None` in this case.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
