### Analysis
- The buggy function `initialize` has a logical error in the condition check for `make_current`.
- The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance is already existing.
- The expected behavior is to make the IOLoop instance current only if no current instance exists when `make_current` is True.

### Bug cause
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current` is True, it should only try to make the IOLoop current if no current instance exists. However, the current logic is raising an error if `make_current` is True regardless of the existence of a current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition check when `make_current` is True:
1. Check if `make_current` is True.
2. Check if there is no current IOLoop instance.
3. Make the IOLoop current only if both conditions are satisfied.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this simple fix, the corrected version should now pass the failing test case.
