### Analysis
- The function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option of making it the current IOLoop.
- The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError`.
- The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, the function should not continue to make the current IOLoop again.

### Bug
The bug is in the condition where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Fix
Initialize the IOLoop instance only if `make_current` is `True` and there is currently no existing IOLoop instance.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the check for the current IOLoop instance before attempting to make the IOLoop the current instance, we ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised if necessary.
