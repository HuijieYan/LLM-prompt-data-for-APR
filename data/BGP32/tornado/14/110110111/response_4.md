## Correction

To correct the buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class, we need to modify the logic to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`. If an instance already exists, we should not raise an error and instead just set the current `IOLoop` to the existing instance. The corrected function should check the condition at the beginning when `make_current=True` and handle it appropriately.

```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            IOLoop.current().make_current()
```

The correction involves removing the explicit error raising when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. Instead, we directly make the existing IOLoop current in such a scenario. This modification aligns with the behavior of the class and ensures that the function behaves as expected.

By making this change, the corrected function should pass the failing test `test_force_current`, and the expected behavior in all cases should be satisfied, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
