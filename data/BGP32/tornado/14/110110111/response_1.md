To address the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to update the conditional checks for the `make_current` parameter. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to a `RuntimeError`.

By looking at the function and the failing test, it is evident that the logic of checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists is flawed. The current implementation incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to set a new current instance with `make_current=True` if there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, we have updated the condition for `elif make_current:`. It now checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not None instead of being None, ensuring that we only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance when attempting to make the current one.

This correction will address the issue identified in the failing test, allowing the function to pass the test successfully and function as expected without raising unwanted errors when setting the current `IOLoop`.

By applying this change, the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class will now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly, guaranteeing that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
