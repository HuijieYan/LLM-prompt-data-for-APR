To correct the buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class, we need to ensure that the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is correctly handled and the `make_current` attribute is set accordingly.

### Analysis:
1. **Bug Location**:
   - The bug occurs in the `initialize()` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditions related to setting or checking the current instance of `IOLoop`.

2. **Bug Cause**:
   - The buggy logic in the `initialize()` function incorrectly handles the case where `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
   - If `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists, the function wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of handling the situation more gracefully.

3. **Suggested Fix Strategy**:
   - We need to modify the logic in the `initialize()` function to correctly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`.
   - The function should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Correction:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if make_current and current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version:
- We first store the current `IOLoop` instance in the `current_instance` variable.
- Then, we adjust the condition for checking whether a current instance exists when `make_current=True`.
- If `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, we raise a `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, we proceed to make the current instance.
- This fix ensures that the behavior aligns with the expected flow of the `initialize()` function.

By applying this corrected logic, the `initialize()` function should now handle the scenarios of setting the current `IOLoop` instance correctly.

This correction should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and enable the `test_force_current` test case to pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
