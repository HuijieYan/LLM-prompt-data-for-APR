### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` might be incorrect when checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
2. The logic for handling the `make_current` parameter might not be correctly implemented.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug arises when trying to make an `IOLoop` instance current while there is already an existing current `IOLoop`.

The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The buggy function `initialize` checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current. If an instance is already current and `make_current` is `True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is contradictory. The issue arises due to the incorrect conditional check in the `initialize` function.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `initialize` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter based on whether there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. It should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is an attempt to make an `IOLoop` instance current while another one is already current.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("IOLoop instance is already current")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None and not current_instance:
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- First, we check if `make_current` is `True`. If it is and there is already a current instance, we raise a `RuntimeError`.
- Then, if `make_current` is `None` and there is no current instance, we make the current instance.
- The `initialize` function will now properly handle the scenario where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and avoid raising the error incorrectly.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to incorrectly detecting an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
