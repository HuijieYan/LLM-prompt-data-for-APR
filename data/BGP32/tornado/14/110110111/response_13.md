### Bug Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance, based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True`, but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, leading to the erroneous `RuntimeError` being raised.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` confirms this issue by expecting the `RuntimeError` to be raised when attempting to set a new current `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug is caused by the inconsistency in checking for an existing `current` instance before making the new instance current.
5. The GitHub issue highlights this inconsistency and questions why the error is raised given the condition that `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. The function should check whether an existing `current` instance exists before attempting to make a new one.
2. If `make_current=True` and there is no current instance, the new instance should be made current. Otherwise, the `RuntimeError` should be raised.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None or make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            elif make_current:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

By updating the logic to consider the case if `make_current` is not `True`, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary and the current `IOLoop` instance is correctly set.
