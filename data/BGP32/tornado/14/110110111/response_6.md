To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to consider the logic that checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists before calling `make_current()`. The current logic in the buggy function is causing a runtime error when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function takes a parameter `make_current` which is a boolean indicating whether the current `IOLoop` should be made the current one.
- The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
- The expected behavior should be to only check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` when `make_current` is `True`, and then proceed to make it the current one.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the failing test case `test_force_current` to pass without any `RuntimeError` exceptions being raised.
