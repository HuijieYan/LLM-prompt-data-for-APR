The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a bug that incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even when the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is returning `None`. The issue arises because it treats the condition to check for the current existence of an `IOLoop` instance incorrectly. 

### Error Analysis:
1. The function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class expects a parameter `make_current`, which is supposed to be a boolean indicating whether the current `IOLoop` should be made the current one.
2. The buggy part is in the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which is followed by a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current `IOLoop` already exists and raise an error if it does, but it fails because it mistakenly raises the error even when it is `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the inaccurate logic in checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. It assumes the instance is not `None` if the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is False.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be revised. It should only raise an error if the instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. This means the condition should be inverted, and the error should only be raised when there is an instance and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if existing_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if existing_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error only when necessary. This updated logic will address the bug and make the function behave as expected in the failing test scenario.
