## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` is a part of the `IOLoop` class within the `tornado` library.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `True` and if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If both conditions are met, it raises a `RuntimeError` which is expected.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current=True`, attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance, checks if it is the current instance, and then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. The bug occurs in the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.
5. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in handling the current `IOLoop` instance check.

## Fix Strategy:
Modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where an existing current `IOLoop` instance is present and `make_current=True`.

## The corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the issue should be resolved. This corrected function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and behave as expected.
