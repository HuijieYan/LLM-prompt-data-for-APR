The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current instance of the `IOLoop` object. The bug arises when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, indicating that the current `IOLoop` instance should be made current.

### Error Analysis:
Upon analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the issue can be identified. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is none, it proceeds to make the `IOLoop` current. However, if there is already an existing current `IOLoop`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that "current IOLoop already exists".

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the condition check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is incorrectly handled. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the initial check incorrectly raises an error if there is already an existing `IOLoop` instance. This behavior contradicts the intended functionality.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check in the `initialize` function. Instead of checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance and raising an error if found, we should proceed with making the `IOLoop` current irrespective of the current state. This way, it aligns with the expected behavior and the input parameter `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the `initialize` function will correctly set the `IOLoop` object as the current instance when `make_current=True`, without raising an error even if there is an existing current instance. This modification addresses the bug, follows the expected behavior, and should resolve the failing test case.
