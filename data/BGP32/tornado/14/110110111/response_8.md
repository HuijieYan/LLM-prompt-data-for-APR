### Correction:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

### Explanation:
1. The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The bug arises from the incorrect check for the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.
   
2. In the buggy function, when `make_current` is `True`, the code checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, and if not, raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. This check is incorrect as it should raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`.

3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to test the scenario where the current `IOLoop` instance is already set (`make_current=True`), and then another attempt is made to set the current `IOLoop` instance to trigger an error because it already exists. The bug is exposed by the incorrect check in the `initialize` function, leading to the `RuntimeError`.

4. To fix the bug, the correction ensures that if `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`. If it is not `None`, then it raises a `RuntimeError` correctly indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function above addresses the issue and should now allow the test `test_force_current` to pass successfully without raising the `RuntimeError`.
