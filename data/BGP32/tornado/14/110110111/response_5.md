## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop object. It has a parameter `make_current` that controls whether the current IOLoop should be set to the new IOLoop instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop object with `make_current` set to `True` and expects the current IOLoop to be set to the newly created object. However, due to the bug in the `initialize` function, an error is raised when trying to set the current IOLoop because the check for an existing current IOLoop is incorrect.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the logic related to handling the `make_current` parameter. The bug leads to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly, causing the test `test_force_current` to fail.

Here is a breakdown of the bug:
- The function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, it sets the new IOLoop instance as the current one.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, but if it is not `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of proceeding.

The bug occurs in the logic where, if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, it incorrectly raises an error instead of handling the situation appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. We should set the current IOLoop instance only if it is `None` or if `make_current` is `True`. If `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists, we should not raise an error.

## Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None:  # Modified condition
            return  # Do nothing if current IOLoop exists
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above changes to the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class, the bug should be fixed and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass as expected.
