To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to adjust the logic related to checking if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The current implementation is mistakenly raising an error even when the current instance is `None`.

Here are the steps to correct the bug:

1. In the `initialize` function, we need to modify the conditional check for raising the `RuntimeError` to correctly handle the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.
2. Adjust the logic to properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make the current instance.

Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these adjustments, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the scenario where a current `IOLoop` instance is None.

This correction addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to the unexpected behavior in line 252 of `ioloop.py`.
