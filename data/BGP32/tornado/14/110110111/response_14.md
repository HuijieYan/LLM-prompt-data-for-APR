## Correction:

To correct the buggy function, we need to modify the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. We will fix it by adjusting the logic to correctly handle the current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version:
- We first retrieve the current instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if it exists.
- If `make_current` is `None`, we check if there is no current instance, then we make the current instance.
- If `make_current` is `True`, we check if the current instance exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError`, indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists. If not, we proceed to make the current instance.

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected based on the outlined cases and pass the failing test scenario.
