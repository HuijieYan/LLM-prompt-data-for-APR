## Analysis:

### 1. Buggy Function and Class:
The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module. This function is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance with an option to make it the current instance.

### 2. Potential Error Locations:
The error seems to be occurring in the conditional statements that check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### 3. Bug Explanation:
- **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function has conditional logic to handle the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if not, it calls `self.make_current()`. If a current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
  
- **Test**: The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should make it the current instance. It then attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` again, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

- **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised even though the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

- **Expected Input/Output Values**:
  - Input: `make_current=True`
  - Expected Output: 
    - First `IOLoop` creation should be successful and become the current instance.
    - Second `IOLoop` creation attempt should raise a `RuntimeError`.

- **GitHub Issue**: The GitHub issue questions why a `RuntimeError` is raised when the current `IOLoop` instance is detected as not `None`.

### 4. Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We need to ensure that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary, based on the presence of a current instance.

### 5. Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None and current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current and current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the `make_current` parameter and the presence of the current `IOLoop` instance. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in GitHub.
