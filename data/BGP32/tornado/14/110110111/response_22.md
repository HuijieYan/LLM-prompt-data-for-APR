Based on the analysis of the buggy function, test code, error message, and GitHub issue provided, here is the detailed explanation of the bug and the corrected version of the function:

### Bug Explanation:
- The `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance with an option to make it the current one.
- The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The bug logic checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists in current context. If it doesn't exist, it sets the current instance as the new one, otherwise, it raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
- However, the bug logic fails to consider the scenario where `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`, indicating that the intention is to set the current instance even if one already exists. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when it should not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` method:
- Adjust the logic to accommodate the case where `make_current` is explicitly `True`. In this case, force the current instance to be set as the new `IOLoop` instance, even if an instance already exists.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing class and code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current and current_instance:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current and not current_instance:
            self._run_callback(self._make_install_callbacks)
        elif not make_current and not current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop does not exist")
```

By incorporating the logic for the additional case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance exists, the bug can be resolved. This correction allows the forced setting of the new `IOLoop` instance when required.

Make sure to test the corrected version against all relevant scenarios to ensure its correctness.
