To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to adjust the conditional checks to ensure that the error is raised only when it's appropriate.

### Analysis:
- The `initialize` function is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The failing test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised if a current instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
- The current bug arises from the fact that the `initialize` function checks if `make_current=True`, then checks if a current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, and raises an error if another instance is already present. However, the error should only be raised if a current instance exists and `make_current=True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Adjust the conditional checks to raise the error only if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
# The corrected initialize function of the IOLoop class
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed the condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment in the `initialize` function, the error will be raised only when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current=True`. This correction should resolve the issue and make the failing test pass as expected.
