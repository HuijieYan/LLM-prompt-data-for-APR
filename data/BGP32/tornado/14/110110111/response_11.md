Based on the provided information, the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly, leading to test failures.

### Bug Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a conditional check for the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` is raised incorrectly.
   
2. **Test Code**: The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then asserts that the new instance becomes the current one. It also checks if a second attempt to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
3. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised due to the current `IOLoop` instance already existing, which contradicts the expected behavior.
   
4. **Expected Input/Output Values**: For the failing test, when creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, it should become the current instance. Subsequent attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should result in a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we should modify the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. We need to adjust the conditional checks to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected outcome.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the adjustments as shown above, the corrected `initialize` function now properly handles the case where `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes successfully.
