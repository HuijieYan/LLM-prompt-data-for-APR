### Analysis:
1. **Buggy function and Class Relationship**:
   - The buggy function `initialize` is defined within the `IOLoop` class.
  
2. **Bug Location**:
   - The bug is located in the `initialize` function where it checks if an `IOLoop` instance is already current, and if `make_current` is set to `True`, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if no instance is currently active.
  
3. **Cause of the Bug**:
   - The cause of the bug is due to incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The logic should only check if an instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` and not raise an error when no instance is active.

4. **Bug Fix Strategy**:
   - Update the logic to only raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance is already current when `make_current` is `True`.
  
### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```  

This corrected version of the `initialize` function ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when trying to make an `IOLoop` instance current and one is already active. It fixes the incorrect logic present in the original version.
