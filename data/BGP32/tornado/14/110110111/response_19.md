## Analysis

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if it does when `make_current` is set to `True`. However, the issue arises when the condition checks for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` regardless of the `make_current` value, leading to the error being raised even when the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then further attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should result in an error since only one current `IOLoop` instance can exist at a time.

The error message indicates that the program execution raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists", which is an incorrect behavior.

## Bug Explanation

The bug occurs due to incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. It checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance regardless of the value of `make_current`, leading to raising an error even when `make_current=True`.

The failing test attempts to create two `IOLoop` instances with `make_current=True`, expecting the second one to fail due to the presence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance. However, the buggy logic incorrectly raises the error regardless of the existence of the current instance.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, the `initialize` function should only raise an error when `make_current=True` and an existing current instance is found. The logic should be adjusted to check for the existence of a current instance based on the `make_current` parameter value.

## Corrected Version

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")

    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks for the presence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance only when `make_current=True`. This change ensures that the error is raised only when necessary, resolving the issue identified in the failing test.
