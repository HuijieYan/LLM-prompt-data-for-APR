### Correction:

Based on the analysis, the issue occurs because the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class does not handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists correctly. 

The suggested correction is to modify the `initialize` method to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make the current instance when `make_current=True`. If the current instance already exists, the method should raise a `RuntimeError` as expected.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version checks for the presence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` is specified and a current instance is already present, aligning with the expected behavior.

After applying this correction, the `test_force_current` test function should pass without any errors.
