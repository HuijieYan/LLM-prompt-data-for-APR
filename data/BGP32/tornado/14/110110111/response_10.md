## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object with the option to make it the current IOLoop instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` which causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.
3. When the test calls the `IOLoop(make_current=True)`, it expects the `IOLoop` instance to become the current IOLoop, but the current implementation raises an error incorrectly in that scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised to only check if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

## Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current: 
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fix: Check if current IOLoop instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None`, we ensure that the error is only raised when an existing current instance is intended to be made the current one again.

This fix will allow the `IOLoop(make_current=True)` call to successfully make the instance the current IOLoop without errors.
