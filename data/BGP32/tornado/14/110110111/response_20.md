Based on the information provided, here is the analysis, explanation of the bug, and a corrected version of the function:

### Analysis:
1. **Buggy Function**: The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a bug related to handling the `make_current` parameter.
   
2. **Buggy Class**: The `IOLoop` class is designed for managing I/O events using `epoll`, `kqueue`, or `select` mechanisms.
   
3. **Failing Test**: The failing test `test_force_current` checks the behavior when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and validates that a RuntimeError is raised if there is already a current instance.
   
4. **Error Message**: The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised due to the current IOLoop already existing in the `initialize` function.
   
5. **Expected I/O Values**: The expected behavior is to raise a RuntimeError when attempting to make a new IOLoop current when one already exists.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises because the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter does not handle the case where the current IOLoop already exists correctly. When `make_current=True` is passed, it attempts to make the IOLoop current even if there is an existing instance, leading to the RuntimeError.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to only set the IOLoop as the current one if it doesn't already exist. If `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance is present, raise a RuntimeError.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current IOLoop is not None when `make_current=True`, the corrected function will behave as expected and pass the failing test case.

This corrected version resolves the bug by ensuring that a new IOLoop instance will only become the current one if there isn't an existing current instance, as per the expected behavior.
