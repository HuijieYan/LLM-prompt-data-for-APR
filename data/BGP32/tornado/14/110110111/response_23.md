## Correction:

Based on the analysis provided, the issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The current implementation checks if `make_current` is `True` and then proceeds to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. If it is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is incorrect.

To correct this issue, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` method to handle the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Previous class definition...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None:
                # If there is a current instance and make_current is True, do not set as current again
                return
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` method now behaves as follows:
- If `make_current` is `None`, it will only set the current instance if no current instance exists.
- If `make_current` is `True`, it will set the current instance only if there is no current instance. If there is a current instance, it will not attempt to set it again.

This corrected version should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the mentioned GitHub issue.
