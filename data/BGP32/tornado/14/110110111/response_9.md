The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to ensure that only one instance of the current `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. The issue arises when a second attempt is made to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` while an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Cause of the bug:
1. The current logic in the buggy function checks if an `IOLoop` instance exists (or not) when `make_current` is set to `True`, but it raises an error "current IOLoop already exists" even if there is no existing `IOLoop` instance.
2. This behavior contradicts the intended purpose, leading to the failing test case and the corresponding error message.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance doesn't exist when `make_current=True`. We should only raise an error if there is an existing `IOLoop` instance in this scenario.

### Corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before deciding to raise an error or set the current instance. This change should address the bug and allow the failing test case to pass successfully.
