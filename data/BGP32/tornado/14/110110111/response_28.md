### Correction:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
1. In the original buggy function, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` was checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`. But the intention was to check if the current instance is not `None`.
   
2. Due to this logic error, the function was incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is actually an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
   
3. The failing test `test_force_current` provides the expected input parameter for `make_current` as `True`. Therefore, the corrected condition in the `initialize` function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`.
   
4. By correcting the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, the function will now behave as expected and raise an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

With the correction applied as shown above, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
