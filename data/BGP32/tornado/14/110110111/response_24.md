## Fixing the buggy function

### Analyzing the bug
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance and manage the current IOLoop state based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and validating that subsequent construction attempts with `make_current=True` should fail.
3. The error message indicates that even if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, the code raises a `RuntimeError` for an existing IOLoop instance.

### Bug identification
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function around the current handling logic, specifically in the scenario where `make_current` is True. The code incorrectly raises an error for an existing IOLoop instance when it should only raise the error if there is no current instance.

### Bug cause
1. The buggy code does not properly check if there is already a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is True.
2. Therefore, it raises an error even if `IOLoop.current()` returns `None`.

### Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic to only raise the `RuntimeError` if there is an existing IOLoop instance and `make_current` is set to True.

### Updated and corrected `initialize` function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is already a current IOLoop instance and `make_current` is set to `True`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and provide the expected behavior.
