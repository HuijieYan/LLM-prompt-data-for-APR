### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is None and then tries to set the current IOLoop instance through `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is True, it again checks for the current instance and raises an error if one already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to initialize another instance with the same flag, which should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, due to the buggy function logic, the error is not being raised correctly.
4. The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. Even if `make_current` is True and there is no existing current instance, the function should still raise an error if `make_current=True` is set again.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks ensuring that the error is only raised if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current instance.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition check to only raise an error when `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current instance, we ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected functionality as described in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
