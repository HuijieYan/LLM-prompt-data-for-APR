### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The bug occurs when checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` in the `initialize` function.
3. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly when `make_current` is set to `True`, even if there is no current `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the condition when checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` with respect to the `make_current` argument.
5. The correction involves checking if `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, then raise the `RuntimeError`. Otherwise, make the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By using this corrected version, the bug should be fixed and the provided test function `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
