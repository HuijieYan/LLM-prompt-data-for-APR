### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if not, then it calls `self.make_current()`. This logic is intended to make the current `IOLoop` instance among multiple threads.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects that a second attempt to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The GitHub issue indicates confusion about the logic in line 252 of `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is used to check if the current instance is `None`, leading to a question about why the "already exists" error is raised.
4. The issue seems to suggest that there might be a misunderstanding about how the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` method works in relation to the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the confusion in the logic of checking the current instance of `IOLoop`. The specific issue is with the `if make_current is None:` block where it incorrectly assumes that `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None` determines whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug:
- Change the logic in the `initialize` function to always check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns a non-`None` value to determine if the current `IOLoop` instance exists.
- Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current=None` case by always making the loop current if there is no current instance.
- Update the code to raise a `RuntimeError` only when a new `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```

With the above correction, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the logic for making the `IOLoop` instance current and raising a `RuntimeError` when needed. The corrected code should pass the failing test and address the confusion raised in the GitHub issue.
