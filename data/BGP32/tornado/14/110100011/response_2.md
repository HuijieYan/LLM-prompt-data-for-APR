### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` or `True` and then calls the `IOLoop.current()` function to determine if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If the `make_current` parameter is `True` and there is no current instance, it tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance.

The failing test `test_force_current` tests the scenario where `make_current=True` is passed to the `IOLoop` constructor and verifies that it raises a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.

The GitHub issue highlights the confusion regarding the behavior on line 252 in the `IOLoop` class where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is used to check if there is a current instance, and then it checks for its presence again with the message "already exists".

### Issues:
1. The logic in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class seems to be redundant and can lead to confusion.
2. The source of the bug seems to be the unnecessary double-check of the current instance existence on lines 5 and 9 in the `IOLoop` class.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the unnecessary check for a current instance of `IOLoop` on lines 5 and 9 in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. This redundant check can lead to the `RuntimeError` being raised even when there is no current instance present when `make_current=True` is passed.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary check for the current instance and simplify the logic in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. We only need to check if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance present. If there is no current instance and `make_current=True`, then we make the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By simplifying the logic and removing the redundant checks, we can ensure that the `initialize` function behaves as expected and passes the failing test case.
