### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object and ensure that only one IOLoop instance can be set as the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, and it checks if an IOLoop already exists. If the IOLoop does not exist, it should raise an error, but it is not using the proper condition to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Bugs:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` in the `initialize` function does not correctly check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition used to check if an IOLoop instance already exists. The condition is checking if the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, which leads to the incorrect flow of raising an error when it should not.

### Fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is already set as the current instance or not. We can use the `current` class method directly to determine if an instance is set as the current one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class code
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not self:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By using `if IOLoop.current() is not self:` in the condition, the corrected version ensures that the `initialize` function correctly checks if the current IOLoop instance is already set before deciding whether to raise an error or make the current instance. This correction addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should make the test case `test_force_current` pass successfully.
