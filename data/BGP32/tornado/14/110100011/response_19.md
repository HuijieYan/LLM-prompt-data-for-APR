### Analysis:
- The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class.
- The `initialize` method is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether to make the current instance.
- The issue reported on GitHub questions the logic in line 252 of the `initialize` method and why it raises an error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
- The failing test `test_force_current` is checking the behavior of creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and ensuring that a RuntimeError is raised if a current instance already exists.

### Error:
- The error occurs in the logic where it checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and decides whether to make the current instance.
- The issue with the current implementation is that when `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, it raises an error. This conflicts with the expected behavior in the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` method to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. If `make_current=True` and no current instance exists, then make the current instance.
- Ensure that the behavior aligns with the failing test scenario where attempting to create a new current `IOLoop` instance should raise an error only if a current instance is already present.

### Corrected version of the `initialize` method:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` method should now behave as expected and pass the failing test scenario described.
