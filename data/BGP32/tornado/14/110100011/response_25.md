### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance and determines whether it should become the current `IOLoop`.
2. The issue reported on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the logic of the `initialize()` function where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` when `make_current=True`.
3. The bug occurs because the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is checked twice in different branches of the `if-elif` block, leading to incorrect behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize()` function to ensure that it correctly checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and handles the `make_current` parameter appropriately.

### Bug fix strategy:
1. Remove the duplicate check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.
2. Check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance only once and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly.

### Corrected version of the `initialize()` function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After applying the above corrections, the `initialize()` function should now correctly handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance and the setting of the current `IOLoop` as expected. This should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_force_current()` passes successfully.
