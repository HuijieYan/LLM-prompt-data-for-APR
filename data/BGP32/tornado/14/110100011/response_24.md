### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance and setting it as the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug occurs when trying to initialize a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised even when there is no current `IOLoop` already existing.
4. The bug is related to the condition check in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly assumes that the absence of a current `IOLoop` means one already exists.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function's handling of the `make_current=True` case. The logic first checks if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, it tries to make the current `IOLoop`. However, when `make_current=True`, it incorrectly assumes that there is already a current instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if there isn't. This assumption is incorrect and leads to the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `initialize` function to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when there is already a current instance present. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
