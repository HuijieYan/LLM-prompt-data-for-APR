### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None` and if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it tries to make the current instance using `self.make_current()`.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current instance but then incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even though the intention is to set the current instance.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` explicitly checks for this behavior where setting `make_current=True` should not raise an error if there is no current instance.
5. The GitHub issue highlights the confusion around line 252 where it checks for the current instance.


### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current instance if it doesn't exist, but instead, it raises a `RuntimeError` if no current instance is found.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function:
1. When `make_current` is `None`, it should only set the current instance if there is no existing current instance.
2. When `make_current` is `True`, it should unconditionally set the current instance without raising an error if none exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Change the condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument without raising unnecessary errors. This will allow the failing test `test_force_current` to pass as expected.
