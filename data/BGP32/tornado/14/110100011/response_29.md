### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks for the current instance of `IOLoop` and sets it as the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is not specified. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it throws a `RuntimeError` if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then validates that the current instance is indeed equal to the newly created instance. It also tests that a `RuntimeError` is raised if another `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`.

3. The GitHub issue points out the confusion in line 252 of `ioloop.py` where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is checked for `None`, but then raises an error saying "current IOLoop already exists".

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The check for `None` in line 252 may be causing the confusion and the incorrect handling of the logic.
2. The logic flow in the `initialize` function might not be correctly managing the `make_current` parameter and the existing current instance.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it should only raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. However, the existing logic in the function does not handle this condition correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to properly check for the existence of a current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. Handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately to ensure that a new `IOLoop` instance is only set as the current instance if necessary.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the logic in the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the existing current instance of `IOLoop`, resolving the issue raised on GitHub and passing the failing test.
