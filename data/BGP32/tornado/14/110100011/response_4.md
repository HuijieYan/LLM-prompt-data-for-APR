### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks whether `make_current` is `None` or not, and then tries to make the current IOLoop instance based on that condition.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if the current instance matches the created instance. It also expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when one already exists.
4. The GitHub issue suggests that there is a confusion in the code logic at line 252 regarding the condition check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This confusion is leading to the incorrect error message being raised.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current instance of IOLoop and then tries to make the current one. However, when `make_current` is `True`, it again checks if there is no current instance and raises a `RuntimeError`. This inconsistency in the logic is causing the bug.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, we don't raise a `RuntimeError` if there is no current instance since the purpose is to make the current instance in that case. We can simplify the logic to handle both cases more consistently.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other class code...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Updated Test Function:
After applying the above fix, the `test_force_current` function should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.

By correcting the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug related to line 252 in `ioloop.py` and the issue described in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
