### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance and determine whether it should be made the current instance.
- The issue reported on GitHub questions the logic on line 252 of `ioloop.py` where it checks if the current instance is None before raising a `RuntimeError`.
- The test `test_force_current` checks if the `make_current` argument works correctly and raises an error when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The condition that checks if the current instance is `None` before raising a `RuntimeError`.
2. The logic for handling `make_current` argument.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class lies in the condition that checks if the current instance is `None`. The logic assumes that if `make_current` is set to `True` and the current instance is `None`, it should raise an error. This contradicts the expected behavior because if `make_current` is `True`, a new instance should be made the current instance regardless of the current state.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the condition on line 252 should be removed, and the logic for handling the `make_current` argument should be simplified to always make the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=False):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the `make_current` argument and ensure that a new instance becomes the current instance when `make_current=True` is set.
