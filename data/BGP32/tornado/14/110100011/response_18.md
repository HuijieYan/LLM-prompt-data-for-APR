### Analysis:
The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance and optionally make it the current IOLoop. The bug occurs when the `make_current` argument is set to `True`, as the code is incorrectly checking if a current IOLoop instance exists, which is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised when it shouldn't.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the `initialize` function:
  - If `make_current` is `None` and there is no current IOLoop instance, it should make the current IOLoop.
  - If `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError` only when there is already a current instance, and not when there is no current instance.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current IOLoop instance, but the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in this case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. If there is no current instance available, it should proceed to make the current IOLoop.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction in the `initialize` function, it should now work correctly based on the intended logic and pass the failing test case.
