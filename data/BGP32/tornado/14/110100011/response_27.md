### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is True. If `make_current` is None, it should set the current instance only if there is no current instance already.
- The issue seems to be related to the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None before setting the current instance.
- The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another one, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised because the current instance is already set.

### Error location:
- The bug is likely in the conditional check inside the `initialize` function that handles the case when `make_current` is None.
- The issue may arise from the logic for checking if there is already a current instance before calling `make_current`.

### Cause of the bug:
- The bug occurs because the code is not properly handling the case when `make_current` is None and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- The logic in the function should not call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is None and there is already a current instance, as indicated in the failing test.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- Update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is None and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`.
- Only call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True and there is no current instance or if `make_current` is None and there is no current instance.

### Corrected version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is True:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above changes, the `initialize` function should now properly handle the cases where `make_current` is None or True, and correctly manage the setting of the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
