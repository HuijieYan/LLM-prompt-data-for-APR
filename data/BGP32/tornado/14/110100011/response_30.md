### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make itself the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
- The failing test `test_force_current` checks whether creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` correctly makes it the current instance, and whether a second attempt to create a new current instance raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.
- The GitHub issue points out a discrepancy in the logic of the `initialize` function on line 252 of `ioloop.py` when handling the case where `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Error Locations:
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not handled correctly in the `initialize` function.

### Cause of the Bug:
- The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the code tries to raise a `RuntimeError` without actually setting the current instance. This leads to inconsistent behavior and the failure of the test case.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- The fix should ensure that when `make_current` is `True`, and there is no current instance available, the new instance should be set as the current instance. If there is already a current instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the logic will correctly handle the case where there is no current instance available and when `make_current=True`. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
