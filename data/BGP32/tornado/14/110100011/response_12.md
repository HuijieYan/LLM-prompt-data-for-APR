### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing a new `IOLoop` instance and potentially making it the current `IOLoop`.
2. The bug in the `initialize` function arises from incorrectly checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when attempting to make the new instance the current one.
3. The issue on GitHub highlights the confusion around the logic at line 252 (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`). It questions why the error "current IOLoop already exists" is raised if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is indeed `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` using the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`. This condition should check that the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before attempting to make the new instance the current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before making the new instance the current one.
We should modify the condition at line #4 to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists (`is not None`) instead of checking if it is `None`. Additionally, we can simplify the condition at line #5 by removing the instance=False parameter, as the default behavior of `IOLoop.current()` already returns the instance directly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
