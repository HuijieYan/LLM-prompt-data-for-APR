### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the file `tornado/ioloop.py`.
- The function `initialize` is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance and making it the current instance if specified.
- The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Error Location:
- The `initialize` function has a logic issue in checking for the presence of a current instance to determine if the new instance should become current.
- The bug lies in the conditional check when `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
- When `make_current=True`, the `initialize` function checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If the current instance is `None`, it should not raise an error since the intention is to make the new instance current.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- Modify the conditional check when `make_current=True` to only call `self.make_current()` without raising an error if the current instance is `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above correction, the updated `initialize` function will pass the failing test case and address the issue reported on GitHub.
