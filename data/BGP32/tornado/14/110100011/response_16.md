### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop instance, making it the current one if no current instance exists or based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The bug occurs in the comparison logic within the `initialize` function, where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` in both cases. This comparison is incorrect and leads to the RuntimeError being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug causes the `initialize` function to incorrectly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The comparison for `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` being `None` is not appropriate, leading to the incorrect behavior of raising a RuntimeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the comparison logic in the `initialize` function. Specifically, we need to check if the current instance exists based on the `make_current` argument and only raise a RuntimeError if a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` Function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After applying this correction to the `initialize` function, it should now correctly handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument and not raise a RuntimeError incorrectly.
