### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and making it the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if there is already a current instance.
4. The GitHub issue highlights confusion regarding the logic in `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and the subsequent `RuntimeError` raising.

### Error Location:
The potential error location is the logic in the `initialize` function where `make_current` is checked and the appropriate action is taken based on the current state of `IOLoop`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises because the logic in the `initialize` function is not properly handling the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, leading to a premature `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, we first check if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If so, raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. This fix aligns with the expectations of the failing test and resolves the confusion mentioned in the GitHub issue.
