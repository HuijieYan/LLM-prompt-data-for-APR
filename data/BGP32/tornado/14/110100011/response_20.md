### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and whether to make the current instance. 
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` results in an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 (`if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) and why it raises an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is already `None`.
4. The issue stems from the fact that the condition to check for an existing `IOLoop` instance is not being handled correctly. The logic should be adjusted to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the existing `IOLoop` instance check. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` should only raise an error when `make_current=True`, indicating the intention to make the existing instance the current one.

### Proposed Fix:
Adjust the conditions in the `initialize` function to raise an error only when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check for existing instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making the above correction in the `initialize` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, and the failing test should pass successfully without raising an error.
