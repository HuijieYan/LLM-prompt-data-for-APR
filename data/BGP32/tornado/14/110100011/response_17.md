### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for ensuring that the current `IOLoop` instance is set correctly based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The potential error locations are:
   - Incorrect usage of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if a current instance exists.
   - Incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic in the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised even if an instance is not currently present.
4. To fix the bug, we need to revise the logic in the `initialize` function to properly check for the existence of a current instance based on the `make_current` argument.

### Correction:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic as shown above, we ensure that the `make_current` behavior is correctly handled, and the `initialize` function will now properly set the current `IOLoop` instance as intended. This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass.
