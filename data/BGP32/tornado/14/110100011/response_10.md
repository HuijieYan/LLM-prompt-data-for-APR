### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` object with a consideration for making the current loop if required.
2. The bug seems to be related to incorrectly checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raising a `RuntimeError` if it already exists when `make_current=True`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect. It is assuming that if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, there is no current instance, which is incorrect. This is leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when `make_current=True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition check for the existence of the current loop instance and correctly determine whether to make the current loop or not based on the `make_current` parameter.
5. The corrected version is provided below:

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_loop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
