### Analysis:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is `True`.
- The issue reported on GitHub questions why does the function raise a `RuntimeError` when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. It suggests that the logic of the function is flawed.
- The failing test `test_force_current` verifies the behavior of the `initialize` function when `make_current` is `True`. It expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance if one already exists.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. In the `initialize` function, the logic to check whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not before setting it as current.
2. The condition where a `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current` is `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises from the fact that the code does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True`, and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. It should not raise a `RuntimeError` in this scenario but should set the `IOLoop` instance as the current one.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current instance is `None`.
2. Only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. Ensure that the `IOLoop.current` method behaves as expected to track the current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By updating the `initialize` function with the corrected logic above, the bug where a `RuntimeError` is incorrectly raised in the presence of `None` current instance will be fixed. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
