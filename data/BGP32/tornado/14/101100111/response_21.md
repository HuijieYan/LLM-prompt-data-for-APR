## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to set the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is a current instance and sets it using `make_current` method. If `make_current` is True, it raises an error if a current instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects it to become the current instance. It then checks if trying to create another instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug occurs because the condition to check if a current instance already exists is incorrect. The function should raise an error only if `make_current` is True and a current instance already exists. The current logic raises an error in both cases, leading to the test failure as the expected behavior is not met.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition for raising a `RuntimeError` to only execute when `make_current` is True and a current instance already exists.

## Bug Fix
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Fix: Only raise Error if current IOLoop already exists
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `else` block of the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug is fixed. Now, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised if `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance of the IOLoop.
