## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` or `True` and then calls the `make_current` method accordingly.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` but `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly in this scenario.
3. The issue seems to arise from a misunderstanding of the logic in the buggy function, where the `make_current` parameter should only trigger the RuntimeError if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is already set as current.

## Updated Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function to check for `current_instance` before raising a `RuntimeError`, the corrected version addresses the issue where the RuntimeError was being incorrectly raised. This fix ensures that the RuntimeError is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance is already set as current.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
