## Correction:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block from `is None` to `is not None`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` existing. This correction aligns with the expected behavior described in the failing test case and should resolve the issue stated on GitHub.
