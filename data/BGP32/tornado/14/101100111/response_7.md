### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists using the `current` function. If an instance does not exist, it makes the current instance. The bug arises when `make_current` is set to `True` and another instance is attempted to be created, causing the RuntimeError.
2. The issue seems to be with the logic of checking for an existing instance and raising an error when `make_current` is True.
   
### Potential Error Locations:
1. Incorrect logic in checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Improper handling of `make_current` flag.
   
### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises due to a logical error in handling the `make_current` flag. The initialization of the `IOLoop` instance is checked based on the current state of the `current` function. When `make_current` is set to `True`, it attempts to create a new instance even if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, resulting in the RuntimeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `initialize` method to only set the current instance if one does not already exist when `make_current` is None.
2. Raise a RuntimeError only when an instance already exists and `make_current` is set to True.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After implementing this corrected version, the buggy function should now properly handle the `make_current` flag and pass the failing test provided.
