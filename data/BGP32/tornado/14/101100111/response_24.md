## Analysis
1. The function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an IOLoop instance already exists using the `IOLoop.current()` method. If no instance exists, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current IOLoop instance.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True`. In this case, the function checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and then raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. However, the `make_current` parameter should force the creation of a new IOLoop instance, regardless of the current state.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects the initial IOLoop creation with `make_current=True` to succeed, even if there is an existing instance.
4. To fix the bug and pass the failing test, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that a new IOLoop instance is created when `make_current=True` is specified.
   
## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the current logic in the `initialize` function incorrectly checks for the existence of an IOLoop instance and raises an error when `make_current=True`. This check should be bypassed when `make_current=True` is explicitly stated.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to always create a new IOLoop instance when `make_current=True` is provided as a parameter. This change will align the behavior with the expectations in the failing test.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing methods current() and make_current() are assumed to be correctly implemented
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
        elif IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the function will create a new IOLoop instance whenever `make_current=True` is specified, and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes as expected.
