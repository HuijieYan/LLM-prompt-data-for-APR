### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current `IOLoop` instance by calling `make_current` method if no instance exists. If a new instance is requested while an instance already exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. The bug in the existing code lies in the condition checking logic for `make_current`. The condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is incorrect.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and asserts that this creation is successful. Then, it tries to create another instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and adjust the logic accordingly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the condition where it checks for the current `IOLoop` instance existence. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is incorrect as it should indicate whether an instance exists (`if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):`). Due to this condition being incorrect, the `RuntimeError` is incorrectly raised when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True`.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Change the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):` to correctly check if an instance already exists.
2. Adjust the logic flow accordingly to address both scenarios where an instance exists or not.
3. Ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True` if an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the initialize method
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By applying the corrections as mentioned above, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle creating new instances and checking for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should pass the failing test case and resolve the issue raised on GitHub.
