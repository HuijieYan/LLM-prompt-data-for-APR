## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if not, it makes the current instance.
2. The bug is related to correctly handling the `make_current` parameter. The logic in the `initialize` function needs to be fixed to ensure that the current `IOLoop` instance is set correctly.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, checks if the current instance is set correctly, and then verifies that an error is raised when attempting to create a second current instance.
4. The bug seems to be related to how the `make_current` parameter is handled when creating the `IOLoop` instance. The logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance needs to be adjusted based on the `make_current` parameter value.

## Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class checks if the current instance is `None` and raises an error if `make_current` is `True`, even if no `IOLoop` instance exists. This leads to an incorrect error being raised when attempting to create a new current instance.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter. Specifically, if `make_current` is `True` but no current instance exists, it should set the current instance instead of raising an error. Additionally, if a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise an error to prevent creating a new current instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current instance exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if the current instance exists and adjusting the logic accordingly, the bug should be fixed and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass.

This fix addresses the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
