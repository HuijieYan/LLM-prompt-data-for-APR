### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking the `make_current` parameter and the current instance of `IOLoop` using the `current` method.
2. The bug seems to be related to handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance.
4. The bug is likely in the logic where the `RuntimeError` is not raised correctly when there's already a current `IOLoop` instance.

### Identified Bug:
The bug is in the `if-elif` block in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, the `RuntimeError` should be raised immediately. However, the code is missing this check.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, a `RuntimeError` is raised without attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore the body

    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore the body

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` block, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when a current instance already exists.
