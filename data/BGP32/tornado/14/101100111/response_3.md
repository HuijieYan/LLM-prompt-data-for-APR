### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is provided. If not provided, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and then calls `self.make_current()` to set the current instance.
2. The bug likely occurs when `make_current` is True. In this case, it raises a `RuntimeError` if the current instance is not None. However, the correct behavior should be to raise the error if the current instance is not None when `make_current` is True.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current` to True when initializing an `IOLoop` instance, expects it to become the current instance, and then checks if attempting to create another current instance with `make_current` set to True correctly raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True if the current instance is not None.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the initialization logic of the `IOLoop` class when setting the current instance. When `make_current` is True, it should raise a `RuntimeError` only if the current instance is not already set. However, the existing conditional check is incorrect, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised when it should not.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, adjust the conditional check within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True. The `RuntimeError` should only be raised if the current instance exists and `make_current` is True.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test should pass as expected.
