## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the creation of the current IOLoop instance. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if the current instance is `None` and then tries to set it as the current instance. If `make_current` is provided, it checks if the current instance is already set and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is designed to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and verify that subsequent attempts to create another one with the same parameter fail.
3. The failing issue on GitHub points out a potential inconsistency in the logic of the function related to the initialization of the current instance.

## Bug Explanation
- In the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is provided as `True`, it first checks if the current instance is `None`. If it is, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if another instance is already set as the current one. However, the logic is inverted, causing a potential issue.
- The failing test expects that the `RuntimeError` is raised when the `make_current=True` parameter is used to create a new `IOLoop` instance. Since the current behavior is incorrect, the test fails.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
- To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if the current instance is not `None` to ensure that an instance is already set before trying to make the current instance. If no instance is set, then a `RuntimeError` should be raised.
- The corrected logic will align with the expectations of the failing test and the reported issue on GitHub.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore the implementation
    
    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore the implementation
        
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the logic in the `initialize` function, the issue described in the failing test and on GitHub can be addressed. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and avoid raising the `RuntimeError` in cases where it should not.
