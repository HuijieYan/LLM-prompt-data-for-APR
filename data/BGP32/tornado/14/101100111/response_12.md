### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True` again and expects a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug in the `initialize` function is that it should raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists, but it mistakenly raises the error if `make_current` is `None`.
4. The bug occurs because the conditional check for `None` is wrongly used in the `initialize` function.

### Bug Explanation:
In the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is `None`, it improperly calls `self.make_current()` which makes an instance current.
- When `make_current` is `True`, it checks again if an instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though `make_current` was set to `True`.

This bug causes the `initialize` function to raise a `RuntimeError` incorrectly, leading to the failing test.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenarios where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or an instance of `IOLoop` already exists.
2. Ensure that the error is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the `initialize` function should now function correctly according to the expected behavior and pass the failing test.
