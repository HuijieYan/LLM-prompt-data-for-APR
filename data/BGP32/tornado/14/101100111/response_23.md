### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True` while a current instance already exists.
2. The `initialize` function relies on the `current` method and `make_current` method from the same class `IOLoop`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to ensure that creating an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` fails if there is already a current instance present.
4. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if `make_current` is `True` but no current instance exists due to a flawed logic in the conditional statements.

### Bug cause:
The bug in the `initialize` function is caused by the condition checking for `make_current=True`, which does not correctly handle the case where no current `IOLoop` instance exists. The issue arises from not accounting for existing instances properly, leading to the incorrect raising of `RuntimeError`.

### Fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to accurately handle situations where `make_current=True` and there is no current `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, the condition that raises a `RuntimeError` should be adjusted to correctly check for the presence of a current instance.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Implementation goes here

    def make_current(self):
        # Implementation goes here

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function now accounts for the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance correctly. Now, the fixed function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
