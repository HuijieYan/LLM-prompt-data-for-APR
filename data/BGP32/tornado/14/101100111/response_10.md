## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if `make_current` is None and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, then it calls `self.make_current()`. However, there is a logic error in the elif condition where it also checks if `make_current` is True.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True` is passed to `IOLoop` constructor, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect logic in how the `make_current` parameter is handled, leading to the `RuntimeError` not being raised when expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised correctly when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and an existing `IOLoop` instance already exists. Due to the incorrect condition check in the elif block, the `RuntimeError` is not raised as expected.

## Fix Strategy
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.
2. Ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if an instance already exists.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is raised correctly when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if an instance already exists.
