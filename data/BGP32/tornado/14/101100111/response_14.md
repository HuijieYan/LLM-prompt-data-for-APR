### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle initialization logic based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None`, then it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to check if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and if so, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks again if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and if not, raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, asserts that it is the current IOLoop, tries to create a new `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`, and then checks if the original instance is still the current one.
4. The bug occurs due to incorrect checking of the existing current IOLoop instance before creating a new one, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. In the case where `make_current` is `True`, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` only if there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.

### Proposed Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct flow is followed based on the value of the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, it should create a new current IOLoop instance if one doesn't already exist. If `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` only if there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, we can ensure that the correct behavior is followed when initializing the IOLoop instances. This fixed version should now pass the failing test and correctly handle the initialization of the current IOLoop instances.
