## Analysis
1. The buggy `initialize` function is checking if `make_current` is `None` and then calls `self.make_current()` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not `None`.
2. In the failing test, `IOLoop(make_current=True)` is creating an `IOLoop` instance and setting it as the current instance, then a second call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)` is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` since the current instance already exists.

## Bug Explanation
The bug is in the logic where if `make_current` is `True`, it should not create a new instance if `IOLoop.current()` is not `None`. However, the current logic does not correctly handle this scenario and allows multiple instances to be created, leading to the failing test.

## Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists. We need to ensure that only one instance can be the current instance at a time.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the initialize function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will now correctly handle the case of multiple instances creation when `make_current` is `True`. The issue in the failing test should be resolved with this fix.
