## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the `IOLoop` instance, setting it as the current instance. However, there are issues with the logic that handles the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, but a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. In this case, the code should raise a `RuntimeError`, but currently, it does not handle this scenario correctly.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current=True` when creating an `IOLoop` instance. It then tries to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised. However, due to the bug, the `RuntimeError` is not raised as expected.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised appropriately.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. In the `initialize` function, when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, the code should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Update the logic to handle this scenario, ensuring that the `IOLoop` instance is not replaced if it already exists when `make_current=True`.
3. Modify the condition to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the fix, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` as expected. This fix resolves the bug and ensures the failing test `test_force_current` passes with the correct behavior.
