The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter. The logic inside the function is intended to check if an instance of `IOLoop` is already current. However, the condition check for `make_current` being `True` or `None` is not correctly implemented.

The `initialize` function should ensure that if `make_current` is `True`, then the current `IOLoop` instance is initialized correctly. If `make_current` is `None`, then it should also initialize a current instance only if one does not already exist.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the two cases - `make_current` is `True` or `None`.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function now correctly checks if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to make it current based on the `make_current` parameter. This modification should address the issue and pass the failing test case provided.
