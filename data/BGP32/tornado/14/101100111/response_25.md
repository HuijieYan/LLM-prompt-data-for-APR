### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is using the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` function to check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists. Based on the condition, if `make_current` is not provided, and there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it calls `self.make_current()` to set the current instance.
2. In the failing test `test_force_current`, it first creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, and then tries to create another instance with the same parameter. The test expects an error to be raised because only one current instance is allowed.

### Error
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the logic flow when `make_current` is provided as `True`. The condition should check if a current instance already exists before invoking `self.make_current()` or raising an error.

### Bug Cause
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. It checks for the existence of a current instance after trying to make the current instance, which leads to the error being incorrectly raised.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic inside the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted. Check for the existence of a current instance first and then decide whether to make the current instance or raise an error based on that.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Implement the current function
    
    def make_current(self):
        # Implement the make_current function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version of the `initialize` function, it will first check for the presence of a current instance and only attempt to make the current instance if no instance currently exists. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance, it will raise an error as expected in the failing test.
