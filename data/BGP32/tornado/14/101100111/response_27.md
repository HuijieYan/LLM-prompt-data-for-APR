### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether an instance of `IOLoop` is already current and raises an error if `make_current` parameter is true and an instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that creating a new instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance is already current, and the existing instance should remain current.
3. The bug arises from the incorrect condition in the `initialize` function where the check for an existing current instance is not functioning as expected due to the `make_current` parameter handling.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition checks in the `initialize` function to properly handle whether an instance is already current or not.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. The condition for raising an error if an instance is already current (`if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) is incorrect and should be modified. 

### Fix Strategy:
1. Update the condition to check if a current instance exists properly.
2. Handle the `make_current` parameter based on the condition checks to ensure the correct behavior.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
            else:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Now, with the corrected version of the `initialize` function, it should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values mentioned in the analysis.
