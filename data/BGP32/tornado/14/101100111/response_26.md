### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has a conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, calls the `make_current` function from the same class. If `make_current` is not `None`, it then checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance is already present, and if not, raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. In the failing test `test_force_current`, an `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, and then the current `IOLoop` instance is compared to the newly created one. A `RuntimeError` is expected to be raised when trying to create another `IOLoop` instance with` make_current=True`.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function if `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. As per the test case, it is expected that a `RuntimeError` should be raised in this scenario. However, the conditional check in the `initialize` function does not correctly handle this case leading to the issue reported in the GitHub post.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current` is explicitly set to `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Ensure that if `make_current` is `True` and an instance of `IOLoop` already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised immediately without trying to set the current instance again.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional checks in the `initialize` function, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test case should now pass as expected.
