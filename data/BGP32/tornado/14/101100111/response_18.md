### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function checks the state of the current IOLoop using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is `None`, it should either proceed with making the current IOLoop or raise an error based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect condition in the `if` branch, where it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Explanation
When the test case calls `IOLoop(make_current=True)`, the buggy `initialize` function is called. In the function, when `make_current=True`, it checks if the current IOLoop is `None` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If it is `None`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` since a new IOLoop cannot be initiated when one already exists. However, due to the incorrect condition check, it fails to raise the `RuntimeError` in this scenario, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Suggested Fix
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop already exists. We need to check for both scenarios separately and raise the `RuntimeError` when necessary.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With the corrected version above, the `initialize` function checks for the existing IOLoop correctly when `make_current=True` and raises the `RuntimeError` as expected. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and pass the failing test case.
