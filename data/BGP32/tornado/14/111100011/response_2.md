### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` function within the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado` library.
2. The function initializes the IOLoop instance and potentially sets it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` is not None.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument. The logic is incorrect as it checks if there is no current instance before raising an error, but it should be checking if there is a current instance instead.
4. The bug is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly when `make_current=True`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, the condition checking for an existing current instance should be reversed. It should raise an error if there is already a current instance when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Condition updated
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Error message updated
        self.make_current()
```

By fixing the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of a current instance, the bug should be resolved. This corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub related to line 252 in `ioloop.py` within the `tornado` library.
