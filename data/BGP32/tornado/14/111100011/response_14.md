## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and whether to make the new instance the current one based on the `make_current` parameter.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, raising a `RuntimeError` incorrectly.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` validates that attempting to construct a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should only succeed if there is no current instance, otherwise, it should raise `RuntimeError`.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused because of incorrect checks in the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current` is `True`, it should only raise an error if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
- However, the current implementation also raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, which is incorrect.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised in the `initialize` function:
- The `RuntimeError` should only be raised if `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. The fixed code should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
