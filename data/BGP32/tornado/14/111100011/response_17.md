## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the current `IOLoop` instance. It checks if a current instance exists and then either makes itself the current instance or raises an error if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.
2. The issue seems to stem from the logic in the `initialize` function where it raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, even though the preceding condition already attempted to make itself the current instance.
3. The test function `test_force_current` verifies this scenario by attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` after one has already been made current, expecting a `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists.

## Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Check if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists before trying to make the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is `True` and a current instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError` immediately.
3. If `make_current` is `False`, do not attempt to make the current instance.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test scenario.
