### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the current IOLoop instance based on the provided `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug in the code is that even if `make_current` is set to `False`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance is None and then proceeds to make it current if it is None, which is incorrect.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` constructs a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to construct another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` again, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the conditions in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter.


### Correction:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition in the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter, the bug can be fixed and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
