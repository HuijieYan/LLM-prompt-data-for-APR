### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current IOLoop instance. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which specifies whether the current instance should be forcefully set.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub suggests that there might be a problem with the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current instance is `None` and then raises an error if `make_current` is set to `True`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` confirms that the error is indeed triggered when trying to force the current instance when one already exists, but the check seems incorrect.
4. The bug seems to be related to the conditional checks inside the `initialize` function.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the `initialize` function:
  - If `make_current` is `None` and the current instance is `None`, then it sets the current IOLoop instance.
  - If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance is `None`, and if it is not `None`, then it raises a `RuntimeError`.
- The bug occurs when the condition is checked as `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and `make_current` is `True`. The logic should only raise an error if the current instance is not `None` and `make_current` is `True`. Current logic raises an error if the current instance is `None` and `make_current` is `True`, which is incorrect.

### Fix Strategy:
- Modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to raise an error only if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance is not `None`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly raise an error only if `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop instance exists. This change should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and make the failing test pass.
