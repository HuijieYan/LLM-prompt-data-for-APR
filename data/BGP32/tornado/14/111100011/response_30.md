### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop.
2. The issue arises in the case where `make_current=True` is passed as an argument to `initialize`, but the current IOLoop instance is already existing.
3. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it raises an error when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, which is contradictory.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Fix:
Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly check if `make_current=True` and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance before raising an error.

This fix should address the issue raised in the GitHub report and allow the test case `test_force_current` to pass successfully.
