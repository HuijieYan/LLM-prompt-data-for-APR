### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks the `make_current` argument to decide whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and makes the current one if not. If `make_current` is provided as `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance and raises an error if so.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` correctly sets it as the current instance and ensures that a second attempt to create a current instance fails.
3. The GitHub issue suggests that there might be a discrepancy between checking if the current instance is `None` and then raising an error indicating that the current instance already exists.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function because it does not properly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. In this case, it should raise an error immediately, but currently, it tries to check for the current instance again before raising the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to directly raise an error if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance. This will avoid redundant checks and ensure that the error is raised as expected.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By directly checking the `current_instance` variable and raising an error if it is not `None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the correct behavior is enforced. This corrected version should pass the failing test `test_force_current` and address the issue reported on GitHub.
