### Analysis:
1. The `initialize()` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is `None`. If it is `None`, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` as well. If it is, it calls the `make_current()` function. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if the current instance is `None` and raises an error if it is not.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` instantiates an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`. It then checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the newly created instance, and it also checks if attempting to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Error location:
The issue occurs because in the `initialize()` function, the check for `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is missing a negation when entering the `elif` block with `make_current` set to `True`. This leads to an incorrect check for an already existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug cause:
The bug causes the `RuntimeError` to be incorrectly raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, even if there is no existing current instance.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to add a negation in the `elif` block to ensure that the correct condition is checked before raising the `RuntimeError`. This will prevent the error from being raised when it is not appropriate.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Added a negation check here
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected the condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the above correction, the bug in the `initialize()` function should be fixed and the `test_force_current` test should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
