### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and tries to make the current instance if `make_current` is not provided or is set to `True`. If `make_current=True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The GitHub issue points out the confusion regarding the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py` where it checks `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` before raising an "already exists" error. The logic seems contradictory.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that if `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError` immediately without calling `self.make_current()`. Also, the logic for handling `make_current=None` should be clarified.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. In the `initialize` function, if `make_current` is set to `True`, first check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is, raise a `RuntimeError` immediately. If not, then proceed with making the current instance.
2. If `make_current=None`, simply make the current instance if no current instance exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function with the corrected logic, the bug should be fixed, and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
