### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current instance of the `IOLoop`. It checks if a current instance already exists and handles the logic accordingly.
2. The bug seems to be in the conditional check when `make_current` is `True`. The logic checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` does not exist and then raises a `RuntimeError` even if it doesn't exist.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic is inverted in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should be checking if the current instance is `None` before raising an error.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` exists.

### Proposed Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the logic when `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` exists.

This correction should resolve the bug reported in the GitHub issue by addressing the inverted conditional check.
