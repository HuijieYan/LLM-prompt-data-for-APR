### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The issue seems to be related to the logic used to determine whether to set the current instance or raise an error.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create two instances with `make_current=True`, expecting the second one to raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 in `ioloop.py` where it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before deciding to raise an error.
   
### Cause of the bug:
The issue seems to be caused by the logic in the `initialize` function where it incorrectly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before deciding whether to set the current instance or raise an error. In the failing test, the second attempt to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise an error, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `make_current` flag is `True`, and if the current instance is not `None`, then raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. If the `make_current` flag is `True`, set the current instance.
3. If `make_current` is `None`, only set the current instance if it is not already set.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By correcting the logic as described above, the issue raised in GitHub should be resolved and the failing test should pass successfully.
