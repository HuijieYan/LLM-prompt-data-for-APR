### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then tries to make it current based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if the `make_current=True` construction of `IOLoop` raises a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
3. The GitHub issue questions the logic in line 252 of `initialize` function where `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` and then it raises an error.
4. The issue seems to be caused by a logic inconsistency in handling the `make_current` parameter and verifying the current instance.

### Bug cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it raises a `RuntimeError` when the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, instead of when it actually exists.

### Suggested fix strategy:
- Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` instance is or is not `None`.
- Ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance already exists and `make_current=True` is specified.

### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop` existing.
