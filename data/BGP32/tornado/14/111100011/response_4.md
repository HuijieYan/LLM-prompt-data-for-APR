### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for checking the current instance of the `IOLoop` and making it the current one if necessary.
2. The issue arises from the logic in the `initialize` function where it checks if the current instance is `None` and then proceeds to make it the current one, but it also raises an error if `make_current` is `True` regardless of the current instance status.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is designed to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then try to create another one with the same property, expecting an error to be raised.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and the current instance is not `None`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function where it raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current=True`, even if the current instance is `None`. This behavior is incorrect and contradicts the logic of expecting a current instance to exist and raising an error only in that case.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we should update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If the current instance is `None`, then proceed to make the current instance without raising an error.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function with the corrected logic as shown above, the bug will be fixed and the failing test `test_force_current` should pass successfully.
