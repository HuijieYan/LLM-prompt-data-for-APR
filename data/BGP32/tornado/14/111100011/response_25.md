### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance with a control option `make_current`.
2. The buggy function checks if `make_current` is `None` or `True`, and based on that, it either makes the current IOLoop instance or raises an error if it already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another one, expecting an error to be raised.
4. The GitHub issue raises a question about line 252 of `ioloop.py` where it seems inconsistent why it raises an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition check in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `None`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and makes the current instance. However, even if it is `None`, it proceeds to set the current instance without checking if there is a current instance already present, leading to the inconsistent behavior.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None`, `True`, or `False`. Additionally, we should ensure that an error is only raised if there is already a current IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the conditions inside the `initialize` function and correctly checking for the presence of a current IOLoop instance, we ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected logic. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
