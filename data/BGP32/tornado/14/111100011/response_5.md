### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if `make_current` is `None`. If it is, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and then makes the current instance. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if one does.
  
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and checks that it is the current instance. It then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True` expecting a `RuntimeError`.

3. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 of `ioloop.py` where it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None` and then raises an error for "already exists".

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function inappropriately raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` even if no current instance of `IOLoop` exists, which is inconsistent with the intended behavior.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` and a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. This will align the behavior with the expected logic.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function initialize
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixed condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError` in the function, we ensure that the error is only raised when a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists when attempting to make the current instance.
