### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks for the current `IOLoop` instance and attempts to make the current instance if no instance is present.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then attempts to create another instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
3. The GitHub issue points out that on line 252, the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns None, but the code raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
   
### Bug:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function tries to check for the current `IOLoop` instance. If the current instance is `None` and `make_current` is specified as `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as the new instance should not try to become the current one. However, the logic is incorrect and does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` and `make_current` is specified as `True` appropriately. We need to ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if there is already an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

After applying the corrected logic above, the `initialize` function should now handle the scenario correctly and pass the failing test `test_force_current`.
