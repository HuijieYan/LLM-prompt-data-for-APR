### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. This function checks if `make_current` is None, then it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and makes the current `IOLoop`.
3. The issue reported on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the logic where it raises an error when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, which contradicts the condition, leading to confusion for users.
4. The bug can be fixed by updating the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is None.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
Update the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is None by removing the unnecessary check against `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By using this corrected version, the bug will be fixed and the provided failing test `test_force_current` should now pass successfully.
