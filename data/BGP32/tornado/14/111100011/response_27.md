### Analyzing the buggy function and related details:

1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
   
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, it sets the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current=True`, it checks if the current instance is not `None` and raises an error if it is not. Then it sets the current `IOLoop` instance.

3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries it again, expecting an error because the current instance is already set.

4. The GitHub issue suggests that there might be an inconsistency in the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and the subsequent error message "already exists".

### Potential error locations within the buggy function:
- Incorrect logic in handling the `make_current` argument.
- Possible inconsistency in the behavior of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and error handling.

### Cause of the bug:
The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. The condition where `make_current=True` checks if the current instance is `None` directly and raises an error if it is not, which contradicts the behavior suggested by the GitHub issue.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic related to setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument is correct and aligned with the expected behavior.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional statements in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the `make_current` argument is correctly handled in setting the current `IOLoop` instance. This corrected version should address the bug and make the failing test pass.
