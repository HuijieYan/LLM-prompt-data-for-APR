### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance and making it the current IOLoop if necessary.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current IOLoop is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method to make the current IOLoop.
3. If `make_current` is not `None`, it checks if there is already a current IOLoop. If not, it sets the IOLoop as the current one. If there is already a current IOLoop, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, expects that the IOLoop becomes the current one, and then tries to create another current IOLoop instance, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug occurs because in the `initialize` function, the conditional check for whether the current IOLoop is `None` or not is incorrect. The bug manifests when trying to enforce a single current IOLoop instance using the `make_current` argument.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there already exists a current IOLoop instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if not IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the conditional checks in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the function should behave as intended.
