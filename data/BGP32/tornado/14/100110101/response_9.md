The issue in the buggy function arises from the logic in the `initialize` method when `make_current` is True. The buggy function is checking if an IOLoop instance already exists without considering the current instance's status. This leads to the RuntimeError being raised erroneously.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True. We should only raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists and the `make_current` parameter is set to True.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in this way, the corrected function will pass the failing test mentioned earlier.
