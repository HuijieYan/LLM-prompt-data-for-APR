The buggy function `initialize` is intended to create an instance of the IOLoop class and handle initialization based on the `make_current` parameter. However, there is a bug in the conditional logic which causes the function to incorrectly raise a `RuntimeError` even when the current IOLoop instance exists.

### Issue:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when checking if the current IOLoop instance already exists. The logic incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True`, even if the current IOLoop instance exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to differentiate between the cases where a new IOLoop instance needs to be created and where the existing IOLoop instance should be used.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the function above fixes the bug by first checking if there is an existing IOLoop instance before deciding to raise a `RuntimeError` or create a new IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current`.
