The bug in the `initialize` function arises from the fact that it is incorrectly checking the current IOLoop instance before attempting to set a new one as current. The error occurs because when `make_current=True`, the function first checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, raises an error if it does, and then proceeds to attempt to set the instance as current regardless.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True`. We should only raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True`. Otherwise, we should set the current IOLoop instance without checking again.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected version ensures that the error is only raised if there is already an existing IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`.
