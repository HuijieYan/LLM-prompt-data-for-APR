### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to handle the initialization of an IOLoop object based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when trying to create a new IOLoop object with `make_current=True` if an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if an IOLoop instance can be created with `make_current=True`, and if a RuntimeError is raised when trying to create a second instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug is in the logic that should prevent the creation of a new IOLoop instance when `make_current=True` and an instance already exists.
5. The strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the logic to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

### Bug Fix
```python
# The corrected initialize function in the IOLoop class
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    # Check if make_current is set to True and an IOLoop instance already exists
    if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic in the `initialize` function to first check if `make_current=True` and an instance already exists, we prevent the creation of a new instance in that scenario. The corrected function should now pass the failing test.
