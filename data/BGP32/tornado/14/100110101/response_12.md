The bug in the `initialize` function occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and an IOLoop already exists. The buggy code is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` in this case, which is causing the failing test `test_force_current` to fail with the error message `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop already exists. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, we should simply return without creating a new IOLoop instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and behave as expected.
