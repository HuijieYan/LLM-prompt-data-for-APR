### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is checking if an IOLoop instance is already current and if it is not, trying to make it current. However, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it is not properly handling the case when an IOLoop instance is already current, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug Explanation
- In the failing test `test_force_current`, the `IOLoop` is initialized with `make_current=True`, which means it should attempt to make the current IOLoop. 
- The issue arises when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` when an IOLoop instance is already current, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised.
- The buggy function does not handle this scenario and directly raises the `RuntimeError` without properly checking if an IOLoop instance is already current.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To resolve the bug, we should modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when an IOLoop instance is already current. We need to first check if an IOLoop instance is already current before trying to make it current again.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By including the check for `current_instance` before trying to set the IOLoop as current, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is not raised unnecessarily. This corrected version should pass the failing test case.
