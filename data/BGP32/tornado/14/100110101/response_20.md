The buggy function `initialize` is failing the test case `test_force_current` because it is incorrectly checking for the current IOLoop instance before trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`. The buggy logic is raising a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists instead of bypassing the check and allowing the creation of a new instance.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic in the `initialize` function to always create a new IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`, regardless of the current state.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

This correction ensures that a new IOLoop instance is always created when `make_current=True`, without checking for the current IOLoop instance. This change will allow the test case `test_force_current` to pass as expected.
