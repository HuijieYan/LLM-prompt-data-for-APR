### Analysis
The bug in the buggy function occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance existing. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.
However, the expected behavior is that when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not raise an error but simply return without creating a new instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `if make_current:` block. If a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, we should simply return without raising an error.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: tornado/ioloop.py

def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
``` 

By implementing this correction in the code, the function will now behave correctly when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
