## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` object. It checks if `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if so, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present. If there is, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, verifies that it is the current instance, then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message shows that the `initialize` function raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance while a current one already exists, which is the expected behavior based on the test.
4. The bug is likely in the `initialize` function's logic for handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. The function should prevent the creation of a new instance in this case.
5. A suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `initialize` function to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one when `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new instance with `make_current=True`. This change should make the function pass the failing test scenario provided.
