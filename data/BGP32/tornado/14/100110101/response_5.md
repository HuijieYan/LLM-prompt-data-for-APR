The bug in the code is occurring because when `make_current=True`, the function is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists but does not ensure that it is the same instance as the one being initialized. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised when a new `IOLoop` instance is being created even though an instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the current `IOLoop` instance is the same as the one being initialized before raising an error.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if the current instance is not only present but also the same as the one being initialized, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when trying to create a duplicate `IOLoop` instance.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case provided.
