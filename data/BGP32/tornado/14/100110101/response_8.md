### Explanation:
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to initialize an `IOLoop` object with the option to force it to be the current `IOLoop` instance. 
The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, ensure it is the current instance, then attempt to create another `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` since a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

However, the buggy function has a logical issue. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before attempting to make it current, but it does not properly handle the case where `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists. This leads to the incorrect behavior where the function does not raise a `RuntimeError` when trying to create multiple current `IOLoop` instances.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, then raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. Ensure that the method to make the current `IOLoop` instance is only called when necessary.

### Corrected version of the function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the `initialize` function with the corrected version above, it should properly handle the logic of making an `IOLoop` instance current and prevent the creation of multiple current instances as expected in the failing test.
