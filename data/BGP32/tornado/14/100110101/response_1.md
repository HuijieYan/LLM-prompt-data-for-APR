## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't already exist. If the `make_current` parameter is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then verifies that it raises a `RuntimeError` when attempting to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, which matches the intended behavior of the code.
4. The bug seems to lie in the incorrect initialization of the `EPollIOLoop` instance. The `initialize` method of `EPollIOLoop` does not handle the `make_current` parameter correctly. It calls the superclass's `initialize` method with different arguments than expected.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method in `EPollIOLoop` to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and delegate the behavior correctly to the superclass `IOLoop` class.

## Bug Fix
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# Correcting the buggy function
def initialize(self, impl, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the `initialize` method, we are now accurately handling the `make_current` parameter and ensuring that the desired behavior is achieved. The updated function should now pass the failing test case as expected.
