### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance, including setting it as the current IOLoop. However, the bug occurs when trying to force the IOLoop instance to be the current one (`make_current=True`) when there is already a current IOLoop instance.

### Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not properly check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the current one. This results in the RuntimeError being raised even though the function was called with `make_current=True`.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we need to first check if a current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make the current IOLoop. If it does exist, we should not raise an error but simply skip setting it as the current one.

### Corrected Code
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# This is the corrected function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        # Check if there is already a current IOLoop instance
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # Skip setting as current if already exists
            return
    # Set the IOLoop as current
    self.make_current()
```
