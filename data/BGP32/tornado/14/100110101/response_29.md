The bug in the `initialize` function arises from checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before attempting to create a new one with the `make_current` parameter. In the failing test, when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, the function wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists, even though it's intended to create a new instance.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when a new `IOLoop` instance needs to be created even if there is an existing instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("A current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly create a new `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True` is specified, and only raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
