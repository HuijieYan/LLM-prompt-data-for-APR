The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop instance. However, the bug occurs when attempting to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` when the current IOLoop already exists. This results in a `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug Cause:
1. In the failing test, the `test_force_current` method sets `make_current=True` for the initial IOLoop instance (`self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)`).
2. When trying to create a second IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The expected behavior should allow the initial IOLoop instance to be the current instance, while preventing the creation of additional instances with `make_current=True`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where the current IOLoop instance already exists. We can achieve this by checking if an IOLoop instance is already the current before attempting to make a new one.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function will correctly handle the scenario described in the failing test. The updated logic ensures that only one IOLoop instance can be set as the current instance with `make_current=True`, preventing the creation of multiple current instances.
