## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then either creating a new one or raising a `RuntimeError` if one already exists based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The failing test is receiving a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` because the buggy function is not handling the case where an `IOLoop` instance already exists, causing the test to fail.
4. To fix the bug, the function should also check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to create a new instance with `make_current=True`.
5. The corrected function should check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raise a `RuntimeError` if one already exists when `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the function checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before trying to make the current instance or create a new one with `make_current=True`. This change should allow the failing test to pass and the function to work correctly in scenarios where the current instance needs to be handled appropriately.
