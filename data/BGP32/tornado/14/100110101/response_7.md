### Analysis
The buggy function `initialize` is intended to set the current IOLoop instance. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as current IOLoop already exists.

### Bug in the Code
The bug in the code lies in the condition check for `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `True`, the current IOLoop instance should already exist, but the code is incorrectly raising an error if it does not. This logic is causing the test to fail.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition check for `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True`, we should ensure that the current IOLoop instance exists before trying to set it as the current one. If it does not exist, then it should raise an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_io_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_io_loop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_io_loop:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making the above correction, the function should now correctly handle the scenario where `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. This correction should make the test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
