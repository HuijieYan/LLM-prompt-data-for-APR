### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file is intended to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance.
2. In the failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`, the test is trying to ensure that only one current IOLoop instance is allowed.
3. The failing test expects that when `make_current=True` is passed, the existing IOLoop instance should not be replaced and a `RuntimeError` should be raised if a current IOLoop already exists.
4. The buggy function is not correctly handling the case where `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function occurs in the `elif make_current:` block. If `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, the function checks if the current IOLoop is `None`, which is incorrect. This results in the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` being raised when there is an existing current IOLoop instance.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `elif make_current:` block to verify if a current IOLoop instance already exists, rather than checking if it is `None`.

### Corrected version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

By making this correction, the function will correctly handle the case where a current IOLoop already exists when `make_current=True` is passed.
