### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current IOLoop. The issue arises when calling the function with `make_current=True` multiple times, it throws a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists.

### Bug Explanation:
- The buggy function checks if there is already a current IOLoop instance before making the current instance. If `make_current` argument is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, it raises a `RuntimeError` instead of gracefully handling the situation.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic within the `if make_current:` block. Instead of raising an error when a current IOLoop instance already exists, we can simply return without performing any action.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            return
        self.make_current()
``` 

With this correction, the function will now check if a current IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current=True` is passed. If it does, the function will exit without raising an error.
