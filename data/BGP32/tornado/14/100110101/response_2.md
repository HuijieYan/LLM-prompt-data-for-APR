Based on the bug analysis, the issue lies in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class where it incorrectly handles the case of `make_current=True` when an existing IOLoop instance is already in place. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised when creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` while an instance already exists.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one. If an instance already exists and `make_current=True`, we should not raise an error but simply return the existing instance.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            return current_instance
```

With this corrected logic, the function will return the existing IOLoop instance if `make_current=True` and an instance is already present.

This correction should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass with the expected input/output values.
