### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is expected to create and initialize an IOLoop instance, setting it as the current IOLoop if `make_current` parameter is `True`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create two IOLoop instances with `make_current=True`, expecting the second creation to raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs when the second IOLoop instance is attempted to be created, but the first instance is already set as the current IOLoop.

### Bug:
The bug in the current implementation is that it does not properly check if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Fix:
1. Add a check in the `initialize` function to see if a current IOLoop instance already exists before trying to create a new one.
2. If `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
