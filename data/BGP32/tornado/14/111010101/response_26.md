### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. It checks the `make_current` parameter to determine whether to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is already a current instance, and if not, it sets the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance, and if not, it raises an error.
   
2. The failing test is trying to initialize an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current` set to `True`, but the error message indicates that it is raising an error for an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

3. The cause of the bug is that when `make_current` is `True`, the code incorrectly checks for the absence of a current `IOLoop` instance and raises an error, instead of checking for the presence of a current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for the case when `make_current` is `True`. Instead of checking if there is no current `IOLoop` instance, we should check if there is already a current instance. If there is, we should then raise an error.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
