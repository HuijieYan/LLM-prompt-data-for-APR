### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class and is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` instance.
2. The buggy function checks the `make_current` parameter, and if it is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If there is an existing current instance, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError` is raised because the current `IOLoop` already exists, but the expected behavior should be to set the current `IOLoop` instance if it doesn't exist when `make_current` is `True`.
4. The bug is in the conditional check for `make_current` where it needs to ensure that the current `IOLoop` exists before attempting to make it the current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to change the conditional check for `make_current` in the `initialize` function. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is `True` but there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Otherwise, we should proceed with setting the current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version ensures that the current `IOLoop` is set only when `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance already set.
