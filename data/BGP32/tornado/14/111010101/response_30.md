### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which, if set to `True`, should ensure that the `IOLoop` instance becomes the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance present, leading to a `RuntimeError` being raised.
3. The `initialize` function checks if a current instance exists and then tries to make the current instance based on the `make_current` parameter value. If `make_current` is not provided, it will only make the current instance if no instance is already present. However, if `make_current` is `True`, it will try to make the current instance even if there is already one.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the case where `make_current` is `True` such that it doesn't try to make the current instance if one already exists. We should only set the current instance if there isn't one already.

### Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By checking if a current instance already exists when `make_current` is `True` and only setting the current instance if none exist, we ensure that the bug is fixed. The corrected version should pass the failing test case.

This fix ensures that the `initialize` function only sets the current instance when `make_current` is `True` and there isn't already a current instance present.
