### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current instance of IOLoop.
3. The bug is due to the logic not handling the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance.
4. The buggy function should check if `make_current` is `True` and then verify if there is already a current IOLoop instance. If so, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
5. The bug can be fixed by adding a condition to check for an existing current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the behavior based on the condition of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `True` and there is already an existing IOLoop instance, a `RuntimeError` should be raised. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves correctly according to the expected inputs and outputs.
