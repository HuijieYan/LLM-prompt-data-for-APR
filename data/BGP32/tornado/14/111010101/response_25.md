### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` is checking if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and behaves differently based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test is expecting an error message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance is already present.
3. The error occurs because even when `make_current=True`, the function still checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and raises an error if it does. This is contradictory behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the check for an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, as the intention in this case is to forcefully set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one.

### Bug Fix
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to only set the new `IOLoop` instance as the current one when `make_current=True`, without checking for an existing current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
