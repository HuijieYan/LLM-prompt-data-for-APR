### Analysis

1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance, setting it as the current instance if `make_current=True`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance, resulting in a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect check in the `initialize` function, where it first checks if there is no current instance and then attempts to make the current instance. This logic is flawed because of the race condition that can lead to another instance being set as current before the current instance is made.
4. To fix the bug, we should prioritize setting the current instance based on the `make_current` flag and handle the scenario where there is already a current instance differently.

### Solution

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By first checking the current instance before attempting to set it as current, we avoid the race condition that led to the bug.
