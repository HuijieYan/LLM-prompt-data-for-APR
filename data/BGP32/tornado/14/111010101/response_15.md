### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking if a current `IOLoop` instance exists and if `make_current` is set to `True`, it tries to set itself as the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of just setting itself as the current instance.
3. The error message indicates that the bug is related to checking and handling the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is set to `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the logic in the `initialize` function to only set itself as the current instance if there is no current instance, regardless of the value of `make_current`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to always try to make itself the current `IOLoop` instance if `make_current` is set to `True`, without checking for the existence of a current instance. This way, it will either become the current instance or it will throw an error if there is already a current instance. 

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
``` 

With this corrected version, the `initialize` function will correctly handle the setting of the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of `make_current`.
