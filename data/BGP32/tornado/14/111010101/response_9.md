### Explanation
The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object with the option to set it as the current `IOLoop`. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

The issue arises because the check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance is not properly handled. The code incorrectly raises an error if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, even though the intention is to set the current `IOLoop` anyway.

### Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if there is a current `IOLoop` instance before attempting to make the current `IOLoop`. If there is no current `IOLoop` instance, then the current `IOLoop` should be set based on the value of `make_current`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if make_current and current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function will only attempt to make the current `IOLoop` instance if there is no current instance and the `make_current` parameter is specified as `True`. This corrected version should pass the failing test and meet the expected input/output values.
