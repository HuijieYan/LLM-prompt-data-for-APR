### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` initializes the `IOLoop` class instance with an optional parameter `make_current`.
2. The error message indicates that the code raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The logic in the buggy function is flawed:
   - If `make_current` is `None`, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and sets the current instance if that is the case.
   - If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then proceeds to set the current instance. If there is already a current instance, it raises an error.
4. The error occurs because even if `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if there is no current instance before raising an error. This check is unnecessary and leads to the incorrect behavior.
5. To fix the bug, we should remove the redundant check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Remove the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`. This will allow the function to always attempt to set the current instance, without checking for existing instances.
2. Change the logic to directly set the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.
3. Update the `initialize` function to reflect the correct behavior based on the analysis.

### Corrected Function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Changed elif to else
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```

This corrected version of the `initialize` function will handle the case when `make_current` is `True` correctly without unnecessarily checking for an existing current `IOLoop` instance.
