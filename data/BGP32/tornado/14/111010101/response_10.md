### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to True, and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The buggy function checks if there is no current `IOLoop` instance and then tries to make the current instance. If `make_current` is set to True and there is already a current instance, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of setting the current instance.
4. To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic to set the current instance even if `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance.

### Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `initialize` function to set the current `IOLoop` instance even if `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance.
2. Remove the check that raises `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is True and there is already a current instance.

### Corrected Version
```python
# The declaration of the corrected class containing the fixed function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    (Content remains same as before)

    """


    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the corrected function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function



    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            self.make_current()
``` 

In the corrected version, the logic in the `initialize` function has been modified to always call `self.make_current()` regardless of whether `make_current` is True or not. This change ensures that the current `IOLoop` instance is correctly set without raising a `RuntimeError`.
