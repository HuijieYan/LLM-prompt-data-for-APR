### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` and raise an error if one exists.
2. The bug in the function is that it is not handling the case when there is already a current `IOLoop`.
3. The failing test is expecting the function to raise a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition when `make_current` is `True` to properly check if there is already a current `IOLoop`.

### Corrected Function
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
``` 

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` is not `None`, we ensure that the error is only raised when there is already a current `IOLoop` and `make_current` is `True`.
