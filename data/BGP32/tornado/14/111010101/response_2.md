The bug in the `initialize` function occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`. The buggy function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, and if so, it raises a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists". However, the intention seems to be to only raise this error if there is not already a current instance.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` to only trigger when there is indeed a current `IOLoop` instance, not when there isn't one.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if there is already a current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and behave correctly for the expected inputs and outputs.
