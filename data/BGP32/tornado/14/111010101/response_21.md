### Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the current IOLoop object. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop object present.
3. The buggy function checks if there is no current IOLoop object and then tries to make the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is `True`, it further checks if there is no current IOLoop object and then raises an error. This check is causing the error when trying to forcefully make the current IOLoop when one already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we should remove the check for the existence of a current IOLoop object when `make_current` is `True`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
Remove the unnecessary check for the existence of a current IOLoop object when `make_current` is `True`. Simply make the current IOLoop object without checking for its existence.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            self.make_current()
```
