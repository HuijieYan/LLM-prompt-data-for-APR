### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to a `RuntimeError`.
3. The function is checking if a current instance exists with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, which returns `None` if there is no current instance. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
4. Afix for this bug would be to check if a current instance exists before attempting to make the current instance. If a current instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the function below.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
