### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` from the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` object with an optional parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. In this case, the function erroneously raises a `RuntimeError` indicating that a current `IOLoop` already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is raised when `make_current` is `True`, and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function, we need to modify the `if` condition to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. We should only call `self.make_current()` if the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist. 

### Code Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional logic in this way, the `initialize` function will now correctly check the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before setting it as the current instance if `make_current` is `True`.
