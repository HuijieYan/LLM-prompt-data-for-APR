### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks the `make_current` parameter. If it is `None`, it calls `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and if that returns `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it is not.
2. The failing test is trying to create an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`, which is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised as the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` is not `None`, leading to the `RuntimeError`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance. One approach could be to skip trying to make the current `IOLoop` instance again if it already exists.

### Corrected Version
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if a current IOLoop already exists
            return  # Skip making current if it already exists
        self.make_current()
```
