### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists when `make_current` is set to `True` and raises a `RuntimeError` if it does. 
2. The failing test is trying to initialize an `EPollIOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, triggering the error since a current `IOLoop` instance already exists in the test.
3. The bug occurs because the check for an existing current instance in `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` does not exclude the case when the current instance belongs to a subclass like `EPollIOLoop`.
   
### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to check for the instance's direct type when checking for an existing current instance, which will differentiate between the `IOLoop` and its subclasses. 

### The corrected version of the function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and not isinstance(current_instance, IOLoop):
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
