### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an instance of `IOLoop` is current and sets it as current if `make_current` is `True`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and expects an error if another instance is created with `make_current=True`.
3. The bug occurs because the condition checking for an existing current instance does not align with the behavior of setting an instance as current.

### Bug Cause:
The bug arises from the discrepancy in the logic of checking for an existing current instance and setting an instance as current in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should only set the instance as the current one without raising an error if one already exists.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance. We should update the condition to only set the instance as current if `make_current` is `True` and there is no current instance.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this corrected version, the updated logic for handling `make_current=True` will ensure that the instance is set as the current one only if no current instance exists, resolving the bug.
