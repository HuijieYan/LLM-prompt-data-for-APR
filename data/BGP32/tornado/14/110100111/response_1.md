### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If the `make_current` parameter is `None`, it checks if there is already a current instance, and if not, it makes itself the current instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it forcefully tries to set itself as the current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then checks if that instance is the current instance. It also tests whether trying to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError` as expected.
3. The bug occurs when the function wrongly checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` before raising an error for already existing current instance.
4. To fix the bug, we should directly check if `make_current` is `True` and then forcefully set the current instance without checking if one already exists.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by a flawed conditional check in the buggy function `initialize`. The function wrongly checks if the current instance is `None` before raising an error for an already existing instance, leading to the error condition not being triggered when it should.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter to directly handle the case where it is `True`.
2. Remove the unnecessary check for the current instance being `None`.
3. Update the function logic to correctly set the current instance when `make_current` is provided.
4. Verify that the modification passes the failing test provided.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
        else:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
```
