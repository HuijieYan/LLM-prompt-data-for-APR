### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class. It is responsible for initializing the current IOLoop instance.
2. The potential error locations in the function are the conditions that check if `make_current` is `None` or `True`.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, but the `IOLoop.current()` instance is `None`, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised erroneously. This issue was highlighted in the GitHub post, indicating a discrepancy in the expected behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic to first check if `make_current` is `True` and an existing current `IOLoop` instance is available. Only then should `self.make_current()` be called. 
5. Below is the corrected version of the function:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)

    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

Now, the corrected function ensures that when `make_current` is set to `True`, it only raises a `RuntimeError` if an existing `IOLoop` instance is already available. This change should address the bug and make the function pass the failing test case.
