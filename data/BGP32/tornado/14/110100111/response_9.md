### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The potential error location is in the logic handling the `make_current` parameter.
3. The cause of the bug is that even when `make_current` is set to `True`, the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists is incorrect. This causes the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the check for the current `IOLoop` instance's existence based on the `make_current` parameter.
5. We should modify the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and set the current `IOLoop` instance accordingly.

### Proposed Fix
Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition for checking the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`, we can ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a current instance already exists.
