### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize()` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is None and then either sets the current instance or raises a `RuntimeError` depending on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another instance with the same parameter, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

### Potential Error Locations:
1. The logic for checking the current `IOLoop` instance in the `initialize()` function might not be handling the case properly when it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
2. The comparison between the current `IOLoop` instance and None might not be working as expected.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize()` function is not correctly checking whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. In the failing test, when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, the existing instance check is not functioning properly, leading to the failure to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize()` function to correctly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance exists and the `make_current` parameter is set to True. By ensuring that the check for an existing instance works correctly, we can correctly prevent the creation of a new current instance in case one already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize()` function as shown above, we properly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance exists and prevent the creation of a new current instance if `make_current=True`. This correction should address the bug and make the test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
