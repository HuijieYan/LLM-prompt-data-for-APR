1. **Analysis:**
   - The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
   - The function is designed to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter.
   - The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` is trying to create `IOLoop` instances with `make_current=True` and expects it to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.
   - The bug seems to be related to the logic of setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
   
2. **Identified Error Location:**
   - The bug seems to be in the conditional statements that check for the existence of the current `IOLoop`.
   
3. **Cause of the Bug:**
   - The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly used to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This condition checks if no `IOLoop` instance exists instead of checking if a current instance is present.
   - Due to this incorrect condition, the logic of setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter gets flawed, resulting in the wrong behavior.

4. **Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
   - To fix the bug, the condition to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists needs to be corrected. It should reflect the actual presence of a current instance rather than the absence of an object.
   - Additionally, the logic for setting the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter needs to ensure consistency and proper handling of the existing state of the `IOLoop`.

5. **Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        else:
            self.make_current()
```  

Apply this correction to the `initialize` function and ensure that the corrected version passes the failing test case provided, satisfying the expected input/output values and resolving the GitHub issue mentioned.
