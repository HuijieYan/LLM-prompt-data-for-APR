### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if `make_current` is `None` and then if the current instance is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the instance is `None` and then either raises an error or calls `self.make_current()`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` and asserts that it is equal to the current `IOLoop`. It then tries to create another `IOLoop` with `make_current=True` expecting an error.

### Error Cause:
- The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, leading to incorrect behavior when trying to set it as the current instance again.
- The failing test expects the `RuntimeError` to be raised when trying to set a new `IOLoop` while another one is already current. However, the bug allows this to happen without raising the error.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
- To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when `make_current=True`, we raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists. This will align the behavior with the expectations in the failing test.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version includes the necessary check to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`. This change will ensure that the behavior aligns with the expectations in the failing test.
