### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to make it the current instance.
2. The issue mentioned on GitHub points out a discrepancy in the logic of the `initialize` function where it raises an error even when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition for raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Explanation:
The cause of the bug is in the logic of the `initialize` function:
- When `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it should set the instance as the current one, not raise an error. The current logic does not handle this case correctly.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to set the instance as the current one if `make_current=True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, without raising a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition for raising the `RuntimeError` based on the current existence of `IOLoop`, the bug is fixed. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
