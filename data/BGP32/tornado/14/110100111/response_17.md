1. Analyzing the buggy function:
The buggy function `initialize` is a method of the `IOLoop` class. It takes an optional parameter `make_current` which defaults to `None`. Within the function, it checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`, it calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None`, then raises a `RuntimeError` if it is.

2. Potential error locations:
The issue might arise from the condition that checks if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None`.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs in the else block of the `initialize` function if `make_current` is `True` and the current instance of `IOLoop` is `None. The condition will pass but then it raises a `RuntimeError` even though the current instance is actually `None`, which contradicts the logic.

4. Strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to adjust the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised to only do so when the current instance of `IOLoop` is not `None` and `make_current` is `True`.

5. Corrected version of the buggy function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the function should now properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True`.
