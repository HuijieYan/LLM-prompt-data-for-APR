### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is part of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The function checks the `make_current` argument and the current status of the `IOLoop`.
3. The buggy function can raise a `RuntimeError` with the message "current IOLoop already exists" under certain conditions.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` attempts to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and checks if the current instance matches the created one. It also checks for the `RuntimeError` exception.

### Error Location:
The bug is located in the logic for handling the `make_current` argument and the condition checks with `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

### Bug Explanation:
The buggy function checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None and then proceeds to either set the current instance or raise an error. However, in the case of `make_current=True`, the function incorrectly checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None instead of checking if it is not None to raise the error. This leads to the code flow not raising an error when it should in the case of an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current=True`. Instead of checking if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, we should check if it is not None to accurately detect the existing current `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Fixing the condition here
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By applying this fix, the corrected function will properly raise a `RuntimeError` when attempting to make a new `IOLoop` current while there is already an existing one. This adjustment should address the issue reported on GitHub and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass successfully.
