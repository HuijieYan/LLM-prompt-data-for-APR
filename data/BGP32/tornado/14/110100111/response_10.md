### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if `make_current` is `None` and then checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If so, it uses `self.make_current()`. It also includes a check if `make_current` is `True` to raise an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, asserting the instance to be the current one using `IOLoop.current()`. It then tries to create a second instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug occurs when the second instance is created with `make_current=True`, and the code doesn't handle it correctly. Due to the check on line 9 of the `initialize` function, the `RuntimeError` is not raised as expected because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` evaluates to `False`.
4. To resolve the bug, we need to modify the condition check in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenarios when `make_current` is `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the necessary modifications in the condition checks, the bug is fixed, and the function should now pass the failing test scenario provided.
