### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop class instance and potentially make it the current instance if `make_current` parameter is set to `True`.
2. The buggy function first checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if the current instance is `None`, then it makes the current instance using `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current instance is already `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError` in this case. This logic seems to be incorrectly implemented.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. It then checks if this new instance is equal to the current instance, and it expects that creating a second instance with `make_current=True` should fail with a `RuntimeError`. The current instance should not be affected by the failed construction.
4. The GitHub issue raised is questioning the logic in line 252 of the `IOLoop` class in the `ioloop.py` file, where it checks if the current instance is `None`, but then raises an error "current IOLoop already exists."

### Bug Explanation:
The bug lies in the logic of checking the current instance in the `initialize` function. The logic should ensure that if `make_current=True`, it only proceeds if there is no current instance available. However, the implementation is incorrect which leads to the issue where the error is raised even when the current instance is `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix this bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be adjusted. When `make_current=True`, it should only make the current instance if there is no existing current instance. If there is an existing current instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

After making this correction, the test `test_force_current` should pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
