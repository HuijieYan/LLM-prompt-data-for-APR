### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the value of the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, where the code checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. If it is `None`, then it raises a `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`.
3. The failing test case expects that when `make_current=True` is used to create an `IOLoop` instance, it should set that instance as the current `IOLoop` and raise an error if a current instance already exists.
4. The bug is in the check `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` which is incorrect behavior when `make_current=True`. It should instead check if the current instance already exists directly.
5. The correct strategy to fix this bug would be to directly check if a current instance already exists when `make_current=True` and only set the current instance in that case.

### Bug Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Existing class code
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By directly checking if `current_instance` is not `None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the error is raised when a current instance already exists. This fix aligns the behavior with the intended logic of the function.
