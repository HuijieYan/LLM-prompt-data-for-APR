### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization logic based on the `make_current` parameter.
2. The bug seems to be related to the logic to check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` expects that when `make_current=True`, the `IOLoop` should become the current instance. Subsequent calls with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is likely occurring because the current `IOLoop` instance check is incorrectly implemented.
When `make_current=True`, the code does the following:
- It checks if an instance of `IOLoop` is not None.
- If it is None, it tries to make the current `IOLoop`.
- However, after the check, it again checks if the instance is None which contradicts the initial intention.
- This leads to incorrect behavior in handling the `make_current` parameter.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the logic accurately handles the `make_current` parameter. We should only check for a current instance after trying to make the current instance if `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
    else:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
``` 

By rearranging the conditions and checks in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the handling of `make_current` parameter is done correctly. This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
