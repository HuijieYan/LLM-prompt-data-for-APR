### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for setting the current `IOLoop` instance.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` and the `IOLoop` current instance is already set, causing a `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.
3. The issue reported on GitHub questions the logic behind raising an error when the `IOLoop.current` instance is None.
4. The bug can be fixed by checking for the current instance before trying to set a new one.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True` and a current `IOLoop` instance already exists, a `RuntimeError` is raised even if the current instance is None. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug:
1. Check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to set a new one.
2. Only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current instance is found.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the suggested changes to the logic, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
