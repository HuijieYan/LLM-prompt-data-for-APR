### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument.
2. The issue seems to arise when `make_current` is `True`, indicating that a new `IOLoop` instance should always try to become the current instance and raise an error if there is already a current instance, but the current implementation is not handling this scenario correctly.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` checks if creating a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` correctly handles the scenario where there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests that the logic on line 252 (`IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) is not working as expected and is raising an error incorrectly.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because, in the `initialize` function, when `make_current` is `True`, it first checks if no current `IOLoop` instance exists (i.e., `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`), and if it finds no current instance, it wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of setting the new instance as the current one.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, the `initialize` function should be modified to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the function should either silently ignore the request to make the new instance current or handle it in a way that does not break the functionality.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Consider logging a warning here or handle this case without raising an error
            pass
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the function will address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected in the given failing test case.
