### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the `IOLoop` object based on the `make_current` argument. If `make_current` is `True`, it should set the current `IOLoop` instance, and if it is `None`, it should check if a current instance exists and make itself current if not.
2. The bug seems to be in the logic where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None` or not before making the current `IOLoop` instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` sets `make_current=True` while constructing an `IOLoop` instance, expects the current instance to be set, and then expects an error to be raised when trying to create another current instance with `make_current=True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic of how the current `IOLoop` instance is checked and set.

### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs when the `initialize` function checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` (via `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`) before setting itself as the current instance. This check is redundant and causes a potential race condition where the current instance might be set by another thread right after the check.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary check for the current instance before setting the `IOLoop` instance.
2. Always set the `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By removing the unnecessary check for the current instance before setting the `IOLoop` instance, the corrected version ensures that the current instance is always correctly set based on the `make_current` argument.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test `test_force_current` and address the issue raised on GitHub regarding the logic in `ioloop.py`.
