### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` argument is `None`, and if there is no current instance of `IOLoop`, it tries to set itself as the current instance.
2. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`, and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is, otherwise it sets itself as the current instance.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, asserts that the current loop is the created instance, tries to create a second instance with `make_current=True` which should fail with a `RuntimeError`, and then asserts that the original instance is still the current loop.
4. The issue on GitHub suggests confusion regarding the handling of the `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` check when the `make_current` parameter is `True`.

### Potential Error Location:
- The condition checking in the `initialize` function might be incorrect, leading to the unexpected behavior when `make_current` is `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug arises because when `make_current=True`, the function is trying to raise an error if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, but the condition check is incorrect. This causes the function to incorrectly raise an error when it shouldn't.

### Strategy to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition checking in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current instance and `make_current` is `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition to explicitly check if `current_instance` is not `None` when `make_current=True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary. This corrected version should pass the failing test and the expected input/output values.
