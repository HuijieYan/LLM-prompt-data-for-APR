1. Analyze:
The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of the `IOLoop` instance. The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter. Based on the failing test `test_force_current`, the function should correctly handle cases where `make_current=True` and existing instances of the `IOLoop`.

2. Error location:
The potential error locations are identified in the condition checks within the `initialize` function.

3. Cause of the bug:
The bug occurs because the condition check for `make_current=True` is not correctly handling the case when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`. This leads to the incorrect raising of `RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")`.

4. Bug-fix strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional checks in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the initialization based on the `make_current` parameter and the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance.

5. Corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition checks in the `initialize` function as shown above, the function will correctly handle the initialization based on the `make_current` parameter and avoid the incorrect RuntimeError that was observed in the failing test.
