### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance with an option to make it the current IOLoop.
2. The buggy function checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, then it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance, and if so, it sets itself as the current IOLoop.
3. The bug occurs when `make_current=True`. In this case, it checks if there is no current IOLoop instance, it should raise a `RuntimeError` if there is already a current IOLoop instance, but instead, it checks the same condition as in the `None` case and sets itself as the current IOLoop unconditionally.
4. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an IOLoop with `make_current=True`, expects it to be set as the current IOLoop, and then attempts to initialize another IOLoop with `make_current=True` which should fail with a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect condition in the `initialize` function when `make_current=True`. Due to this condition, the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case where there is already a current IOLoop instance and mistakenly sets itself as the current IOLoop without raising an error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance.
2. Check if there is already a current IOLoop instance when `make_current=True`, and raise a `RuntimeError` if it exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition inside the `initialize` function, we ensure that when `make_current=True`, the function correctly checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists before setting itself as the current IOLoop. This change should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
