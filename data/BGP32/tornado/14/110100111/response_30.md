### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is checking for the current instance of `IOLoop` incorrectly and trying to handle the `make_current` argument.
2. The issue seems to be related to the logic of making the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` argument.
3. The bug is caused by the improper handling of the `make_current` argument in the `initialize` function. The condition `if make_current` is checking for a non-None value, but subsequent conditions are not properly handling the case when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check the existing `IOLoop` instance correctly and handle the `make_current` argument appropriately.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying this fix, the `initialize` function should handle the `make_current` argument correctly and pass the failing test case.
