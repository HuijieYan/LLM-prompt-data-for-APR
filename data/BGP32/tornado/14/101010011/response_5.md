### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize the current IOLoop instance. 
2. The error occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function; specifically, when `make_current` is `True` it should only try to make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. 
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for `make_current` to only try to make the current IOLoop if it doesn't already exist. If it already exists, then do not raise an error.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                # If current IOLoop already exists, do nothing
                pass
            else:
                self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check in the `initialize` function for the `make_current` parameter, we ensure that the error is not raised when the current IOLoop instance already exists. This fix should resolve the issue and the corrected version should pass the failing test case.
