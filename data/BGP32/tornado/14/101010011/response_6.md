### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object. It has a logic to check if an IOLoop instance already exists and throw an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and an IOLoop instance is already present.

2. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is raised when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, even though it is supposed to only raise the error if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

3. The issue identified in the GitHub report suggests that there is confusion about the condition that triggers the `RuntimeError`.

4. The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect evaluation of the condition that determines when to raise the "current IOLoop already exists" error. A strategy to fix this bug would be to properly handle the condition where `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.
2. Ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary based on the condition provided.
3. Add a check to see if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue mentioned on GitHub.
