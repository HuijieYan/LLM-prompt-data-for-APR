### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is `True`, it is checking if the current IOLoop instance is already initialized, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The bug occurs because the check for an existing IOLoop instance is inverted in the `initialize` function. It checks for `None` instead of checking if an IOLoop instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is `True` and raise a `RuntimeError` if it does.
5. We need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the check in the `initialize` function to ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists, this issue should be resolved. The corrected version should now pass the failing test and address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
