### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize()` method within the `IOLoop` class from the `tornado.ioloop` module.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the method checks if an IOLoop instance already exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and raises a `RuntimeError` even though it is supposed to create a new instance.
3. The cause of the bug is that the logic to handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` is incorrect. The method should only raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize()` method to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True`.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize()` method is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the method will now properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to `True` and only raise a `RuntimeError` if there is an existing instance.
