### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an instance already exists before creating a new one. If `make_current` is not provided, it makes the current instance if none exists. If `make_current=True`, it checks for an existing instance and raises an error if one exists.

2. The error occurs when `make_current=True`, and there is already an existing instance of the `IOLoop`. The test fails because the function `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns an existing instance, causing the RuntimeError to be raised.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition for checking if an instance already exists is incorrect. Instead of checking if the return value of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, we should check if it is not None before raising the error.

4. To fix the bug, we should modify the condition for checking the existing instance. We should raise an error only if `make_current=True` and there is an existing instance.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the condition in `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` we ensure that the error is only raised if there is an existing instance and `make_current=True`. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
