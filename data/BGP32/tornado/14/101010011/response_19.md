### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop object. The function checks if an existing IOLoop instance is present and then makes the current instance. If `make_current` is set to `True`, it is supposed to raise an error if an IOLoop instance already exists.
   
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the code checks if an IOLoop instance exists using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError even though it should not raise an error in this case.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` should not be checked for when `make_current` is True. Instead, it should only raise an error when an IOLoop instance is already present and `make_current` is True.

4. To fix the bug, the condition checking for `None` when `make_current` is True should be removed, and the error should be raised only when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Fix:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the elif block to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not None when `make_current` is True, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an existing IOLoop instance is found and `make_current` is set to True.
