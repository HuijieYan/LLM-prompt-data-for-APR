### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` is designed to initialize the IOLoop object. It checks if there is a current IOLoop instance and sets the current IOLoop instance if needed.
2. The error occurs when `make_current` is True and there is already a current IOLoop instance. In this case, the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists, even though the intention might have been to check if it is not None.
3. The error is caused by the conditional check `elif make_current`. The logic should be to check if `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop instance does not exist before creating a new instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check for `make_current` to properly handle the case when a new instance should be created.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function
    
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition `elif make_current` to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary. This correction should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
