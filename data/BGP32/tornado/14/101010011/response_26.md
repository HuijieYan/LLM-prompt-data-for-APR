### Issue Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the class `IOLoop` from the source code attempts to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` or not before initializing a new `IOLoop` instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function attempts to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and raises a `RuntimeError` if one is found.
3. The GitHub issue questions the logic at line 252 where it checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, but then raises an error for existing `IOLoop` instance.
4. The bug occurs because the logic does not handle the case where `make_current` is `True`, and if an `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not attempt to create a new one.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False):
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After applying the corrected version of the function provided above, the logic will properly handle the scenario where `make_current` is set to `True` and there is an existing `IOLoop` instance, avoiding the `RuntimeError` that was occurring.
