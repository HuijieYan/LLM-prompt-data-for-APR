### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to check if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists before creating a new one.
2. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` instance already exists but still raises an error stating that it already exists. This inconsistency causes the test to fail.
3. The GitHub issue points out the specific line (252) where the issue occurs in the `initialize` function.
4. To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. It checks if an `IOLoop` instance exists, but when it does exist, the function incorrectly raises an error instead of handling the case gracefully.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists and handle this case correctly without raising an error.
2. Update the conditional statements in the `initialize` function to properly differentiate between the scenarios when `make_current` is `None` or `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore the body of this function
    
    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        existing_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if existing_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:
            if existing_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After implementing the corrected version of the `initialize` function, it should properly handle the case when an `IOLoop` instance already exists and no longer raise an error in that scenario. This will resolve the issue reported in the failing test case.
