### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to initialize an instance of the class. It checks if an IOLoop instance already exists, and if not, it sets the current instance.
2. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError is being raised when `make_current` is True even if an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the condition for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists is incorrect. The logic checks if an IOLoop instance is None and raises an error if it is not None, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.
4. To fix the bug, we need to change the condition for checking if an IOLoop instance already exists. It should raise an error if an instance already exists when `make_current` is True, not when it is None.

### Updated Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()

# No changes have been made to the other parts of the source code
```

By updating the condition in the `elif` block to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the corrected version of the function will now raise an error only if an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is True.
