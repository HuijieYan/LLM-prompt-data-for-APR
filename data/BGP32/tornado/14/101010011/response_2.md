### Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class has a condition that checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists. If `make_current` argument is set to `True`, it should raise an error if a `IOLoop` instance already exists. 
2. The error message points to line 252 where the error is triggered by the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:`.



### Explain the cause of the bug:
1. The bug occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`, which is incorrect behavior. 
2. When `make_current` is set to `True`, the intention should be to make the current instance the new instance and not check for the existence of an instance.



### Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition check for `make_current` to first check if `make_current` is `True`. If `True`, it should directly set the current instance as the new instance without checking if an instance already exists. 
2. If `make_current` is not `True`, then the existing logic can remain intact.



### Corrected version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```


By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the bug should be fixed. The corrected version directly sets the current instance as the new instance when `make_current` is `True`, instead of checking if an instance already exists.
