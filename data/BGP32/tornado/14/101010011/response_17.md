### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an IOLoop instance already exists, and it should raise an error if `make_current` is set to `True` and an IOLoop instance is already active.
2. The error message indicates that even though `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` returns `None`, the `RuntimeError` is still raised which is incorrect behavior.
3. The bug is caused by the incorrect logical condition in the `initialize` function, where the `elif make_current` condition is triggering the error even when an IOLoop instance doesn't exist.
4. To fix this bug, we should modify the logical conditions in the `initialize` function so that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below.

### Bug Fix Approach:
- Remove the incorrect `elif make_current` condition and modify the existing conditions to properly check if an IOLoop instance already exists.
- Add a check to ensure that the `make_current` argument is not None before proceeding with the logic.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        else:  # Removed the unnecessary elif condition
            if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()  # Moved inside the else block

# Test the corrected function by running the failing test case
self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)  # It should pass now
``` 

After applying the above fixes, the corrected function should function as expected and correctly handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists or not based on the `make_current` argument.
