### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current IOLoop (Input/Output event loop). It checks if a current instance of IOLoop exists and if not, it initializes a new one.
2. The issue arises when `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and there is already an existing current IOLoop instance. In this scenario, it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` stating that "current IOLoop already exists".
3. The bug is caused by the logic flow in the `initialize` function which checks if `make_current` is `True` without properly considering the possibility of an existing IOLoop instance.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`. We should raise an error only if there is no existing IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`.
5. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

In the corrected version, the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` has been added to properly check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`. This modification ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
