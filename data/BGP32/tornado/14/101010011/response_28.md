### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if an instance of `IOLoop` already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If no instance exists, it sets the current instance using `self.make_current()`. If `make_current` parameter is provided and set to `True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
   
2. The failing test is calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` which triggers the buggy behavior where the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` even though no instance of `IOLoop` currently exists.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `initialize` function is incorrect when checking for an existing instance of `IOLoop` using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. The condition for raising a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` is triggering prematurely.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to accurately check for an existing instance of `IOLoop` and handle the case where `make_current` is `True` correctly.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Implementation of the current method

    def make_current(self):
        # Implementation of the make_current method

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=True) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition to check if `IOLoop.current(instance=True)` is not `None` when `make_current` is `True`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if an instance actually exists and is being forced to be made current. This revised logic should address the issue and the failing test.
