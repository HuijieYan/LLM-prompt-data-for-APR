### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance, but it has a bug where it raises a `RuntimeError` stating that the current `IOLoop` already exists when it actually doesn't exist.
2. The issue is related to the `IOLoop.current` function being called within the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `IOLoop.current` function is mistakenly used to check for the existence of an instance without considering the value of `make_current`. This leads to the `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly when initializing a new `IOLoop` instance.
4. To fix the bug, the condition for checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists should depend on the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is `None`, the existing check should be used. If `make_current` is `True`, then the check should be inverted since it should not raise an error if an instance already exists in this case.
5. The bug can be fixed by updating the `initialize` function to consider the `make_current` parameter correctly.


### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By adding `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:` when `make_current` is `True`, the bug has been fixed. This correction ensures that the correct conditions are checked based on the value of `make_current`.
