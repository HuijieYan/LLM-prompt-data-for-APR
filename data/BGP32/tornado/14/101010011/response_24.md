### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is None. If it is, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None and then calls the `make_current` function. If the `make_current` parameter is True, it checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
   
2. The error occurs when the `make_current` parameter is True and the current instance of `IOLoop` is not None, leading to the RuntimeError being raised when it should not.

3. The cause of the bug is that the condition to check if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None is inverted in the `elif make_current` block. It should be checking if the current instance is not None to avoid raising the RuntimeError.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the `elif make_current` block to ensure that the RuntimeError is only raised when the current instance is None.

### Bug Fix:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Corrected condition
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition in the `elif make_current` block to check if the current instance is not None, the bug should be fixed. This correction will prevent the RuntimeError from being raised erroneously.
