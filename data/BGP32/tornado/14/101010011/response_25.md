### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class of the `tornado` library is designed to initialize the IOLoop instance.
2. The error message indicates that when `make_current` is set to `True`, the function is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` stating that the current IOLoop already exists even if it is actually `None`.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and the current IOLoop instance is actually `None`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
- Update the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance is `None`.
- Check for `None` in the current instance criteria specifically when `make_current` is `True` to avoid raising the `RuntimeError`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore the implementation

    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore the implementation

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function includes a fix in the condition where `make_current` is `True`. It now checks if the current IOLoop instance within the `self` object is `not None` before raising an error. This ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when an active IOLoop instance already exists.
