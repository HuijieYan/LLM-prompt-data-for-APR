### Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize the `IOLoop` instance with the option to force making the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, leading to a `RuntimeError` even though the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`.

### Error Location:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function on line 253, where it incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` by assuming that the current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is set to `True`.

### Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the logic in the conditional statement for `make_current`. The code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` without properly checking if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. We should only raise a `RuntimeError` if an `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an IOLoop instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the conditional check in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current` is `True`. This correction should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
