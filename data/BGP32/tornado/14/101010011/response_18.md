### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize(self, make_current=None)` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The error is raised when trying to initialize a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`.
3. The issue arises from the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` when `make_current` is True.
4. The bug causes a `RuntimeError` to be raised even though the intention was to check if an IOLoop instance already exists before initializing a new one.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition logic to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Bug Fix:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Changed the condition here
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After applying the bug fix above, the corrected function should handle the case where `make_current=True` correctly without raising a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.
