### Analysis:
1. The `initialize()` function in the `IOLoop` class is failing the test `test_force_current` in `ioloop_test.py`.
2. The error occurs when the test is trying to create a new `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`.
3. The cause of the bug is that the `initialize()` function is not handling the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. It should raise an error in this case.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize()` function to properly handle the case when `make_current=True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
5. The corrected version of the `initialize()` function is provided below.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize()` function will now properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance before trying to make the current instance. This change should fix the bug and allow the test `test_force_current` to pass successfully.
