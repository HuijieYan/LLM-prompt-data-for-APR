## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of an IOLoop instance.
2. The test function `test_force_current` is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current` set to `True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when trying to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, even when an existing IOLoop instance is already present.

## Bug Cause:
The bug occurs in the `initialize` function when the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` is checked. This condition is incorrect because it should check if the current IOLoop instance is `not None` instead.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correct the condition in the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance is `not None`, indicating the presence of an existing IOLoop instance. If the current IOLoop instance already exists, raising a `RuntimeError` is the appropriate behavior.

## Corrected Version:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    # Existing functions

    def current(instance=True):
        # Ignore

    def make_current(self):
        # Ignore

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this corrected version, the condition in the `initialize` function correctly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance. This change ensures that a `RuntimeError` is only raised when a new IOLoop instance is being created with `make_current=True` and an existing IOLoop instance is already present.
