### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The function checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if so, it checks if there is a current instance of `IOLoop` by calling the `current` function with `instance=False`. If no instance exists, it tries to make the current instance.
3. In the failing test, the issue lies when trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The failing test is expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised since a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
4. The bug occurs because the `initialize` function does not check if another `IOLoop` instance already exists when `make_current=True`. It incorrectly assumes that checking if the current instance is `None` is sufficient.
5. To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when `make_current=True`, it raises a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug fix:
Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `elif` block to check if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists when `make_current=True`, we ensure that a `RuntimeError` is raised when necessary.

This fix should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
