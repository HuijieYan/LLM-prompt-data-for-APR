The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not handling the case when `make_current` is set to `True` correctly. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, but it throws a `RuntimeError` if it does, which is not the intended behavior based on the test code.

To fix this bug, we need to change the condition check when `make_current` is set to `True`. Instead of throwing an error if the current `IOLoop` already exists, we should simply return without doing anything in this case.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                return
            self.make_current()
```

By making this change, the corrected `initialize` function will not throw a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` already exists. Instead, it will simply return without making any changes.

With this correction, the failing test should pass, and the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` should no longer be raised.
