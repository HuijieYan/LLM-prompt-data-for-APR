### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, it sets the current loop to the current instance.
2. The failing test function `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
3. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised when a second `IOLoop` instance is being created with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug is occurring because the condition to raise an error is always being evaluated to `True`, causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even if no instance exists.

### Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function lies in the condition `elif make_current:`. This condition always evaluates to `True` due to the truthiness of `make_current`, which is causing the `RuntimeError` to be raised even when no current instance exists.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, the condition `elif make_current:` should be modified so that it only raises the `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists and `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:  # Fix the condition to only execute when make_current is explicitly true
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if an instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("Current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction in place, the `initialize` function will only raise a `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists and `make_current` is explicitly set to `True`.
