### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance using the `IOLoop.current` method before trying to set the current `IOLoop` instance using the `make_current` method.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which should set the current instance. If the current instance is already set, it should raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error occurs because the buggy implementation in the `initialize` function does not correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance set.
4. To fix the bug, we need to check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before setting a new current instance. If one already exists, we should raise a `RuntimeError`.
5. I will provide a corrected version of the `initialize` function below.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance before trying to set a new one.
2. If `make_current=True` and a current instance already exists, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Update the logic to handle the `make_current` parameter properly.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: tornado/ioloop.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # This function from the same class is called by the buggy function
    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    # Corrected version of the buggy function
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making the above corrections, the `initialize` function should now correctly set the current `IOLoop` instance based on the `make_current` parameter and handle cases where a current instance already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test provided.
