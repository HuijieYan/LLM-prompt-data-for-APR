## Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance, especially in cases where `make_current` is `True`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` aims to test the behavior of the IOLoop instance when `make_current` is set to `True`. It expects that a RuntimeError should be raised when a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted.
3. The bug in the `initialize` function is that it is raising a `RuntimeError` too early, which causes the test to fail.
4. The strategy to fix the bug is to first check if `IOLoop.current` is not `None` before raising the `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `RuntimeError` will only be raised when a second `make_current=True` construction is attempted without the need to create a new IOLoop instance prematurely.
