### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the `IOLoop` object.
2. The function takes an optional parameter `make_current` which determines whether the current `IOLoop` instance should be set as the current `IOLoop`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is attempting to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then expects an error when trying to create another instance with `make_current=True`.
4. The error message indicates that the second attempt to create an `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True` is raising a `RuntimeError` because the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
1. The bug occurs because the buggy function does not correctly handle the case where an `IOLoop` instance is already set as the current `IOLoop` and another instance is being created with `make_current=True`.
2. The buggy function only checks if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when `make_current` is `True`, but it does not check if the current `IOLoop` is the same instance being initialized.

### Bug Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the scenario where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists and is the same as the one being initialized.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the function
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By comparing the current instance with `self` before raising the `RuntimeError`, we ensure that the error is only raised when trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` if a different `IOLoop` instance is already set as the current one.
