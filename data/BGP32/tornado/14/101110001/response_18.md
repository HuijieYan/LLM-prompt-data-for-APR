### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class has an issue with the logic when `make_current` is True. It checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already created, but if a new instance is being initialized with `make_current=True`, it raises a RuntimeError incorrectly.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then verifies if the `current` instance is the same.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Update the logic in the `initialize` function to only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is True and the current instance is not already set. Otherwise, continue the initialization process.
2. Ensure that the test case validates the correct behavior where creating a new instance with `make_current=True` is allowed only if there is no current instance.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    
    def current(instance=True):
        pass
        
    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected version should be able to pass the failing test.
