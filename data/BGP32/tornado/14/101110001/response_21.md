### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `IOLoop.initialize()` is supposed to initialize an instance of `IOLoop`, but the bug is causing it to incorrectly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, which is expected to raise a `RuntimeError` if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
3. The bug in the `IOLoop.initialize()` function causes it to incorrectly check for the existence of a current `IOLoop` instance, leading to the premature `RuntimeError` being raised when a new instance is created with `make_current=True`.
4. The bug can be fixed by properly checking and handling the case where a current instance of `IOLoop` already exists when trying to initialize a new one.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the logic in the `IOLoop.initialize()` function to first check if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists before proceeding with initialization.
2. If a current instance exists and the `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. If `make_current=None`, initiate the current instance before proceeding with the initialization.
4. By fixing the logical flow within the `IOLoop.initialize()` function, the bug causing the premature `RuntimeError` will be resolved.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_loop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if current_loop is not None:
        if make_current:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        return
    if make_current or make_current is None:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By implementing these changes, the corrected version of the `IOLoop.initialize()` function should now handle the initialization process accurately based on the presence of a current `IOLoop` instance.
