### Analysis:

1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The failing test is `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file.
3. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when attempting to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. This is because the `initialize` method checks if a current `IOLoop` already exists and raises an error if so.
4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` method to allow for the case where a current `IOLoop` exists and gracefully handle it.

### Proposed Fix:

```python
# Fixing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Modified condition
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition in the `initialize` method to check if a current `IOLoop` exists (`is not None`) instead of checking if it does not exist, we can correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance is present and raise an error as expected.

This corrected version of the `initialize` method should pass the failing test.
