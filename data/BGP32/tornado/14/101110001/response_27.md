### Analysis:
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is designed to set the current IOLoop instance. It checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists and whether to create a new one.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and expects an error to be raised if a current IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The error occurs because the `initialize` function is not handling the case when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists. It should raise an error in this scenario.
4. To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `initialize` function to properly handle the condition when `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

### Fix and Explanation:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the fixed version, we start by storing the current IOLoop instance in the variable `current_instance`. Then, we check the value of `make_current`. If `make_current` is `None`, we proceed to create a new IOLoop instance only if `current_instance` is `None`. If `make_current` is `True`, we check if `current_instance` already exists. If it does, we raise a `RuntimeError` as indicated in the failing test.

By updating the logic as shown above, the `initialize` function now correctly handles the case when creating a new IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` and an existing IOLoop instance is present.

This revision should address the bug and make the failing test case `test_force_current` pass successfully.
