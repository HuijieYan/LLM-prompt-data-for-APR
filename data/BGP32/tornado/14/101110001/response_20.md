### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is the `initialize` method within the `IOLoop` class.
2. The method initializes the `IOLoop` instance and checks if the `IOLoop.current()` instance already exists.
3. The failing test (`test_force_current`) tries to create two instances with `make_current=True` which should raise a `RuntimeError` on the second attempt.
4. The bug is related to the incorrect logic in the `initialize` method, where it does not properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance.
5. The buggy function is not properly checking the existing current instance which leads to the error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` method to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current instance. Specifically, we need to raise a `RuntimeError` in this case.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None` before trying to create a new one when `make_current=True`, the corrected version should pass the failing test.
