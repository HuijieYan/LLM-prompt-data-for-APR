### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is checking if the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` and if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. If it does, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` again, which should fail.
3. The error message shows that the `RuntimeError` is being raised as expected when the second `IOLoop(make_current=True)` is called after the first one.
4. The bug is occurring because the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is being done incorrectly in the `initialize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to create a new one with `make_current=True`. We should also ensure that the current `IOLoop` is set accordingly.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_ioloop = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_ioloop is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_ioloop is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

After making the above correction to the `initialize` function, the test case `test_force_current` should pass without any `RuntimeError` being raised.
