### Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`.
2. The function checks if the `make_current` argument is provided or not. If not provided, it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists and if not, makes the current IOLoop. If `make_current` is provided and an IOLoop instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` creates an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.
4. The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` if `make_current` is provided and an IOLoop instance already exists, instead of checking if the current IOLoop instance is the same as the new one being created.
5. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to check if the current IOLoop instance equals the new instance being created.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None and current_instance is not self:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By modifying the logic to also check if the current instance is not the same as the new instance being created, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when a different IOLoop instance already exists. This corrected version should pass the failing test.
