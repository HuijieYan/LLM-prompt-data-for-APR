### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` is responsible for setting the current instance of `IOLoop`.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` in `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` checks if calling `IOLoop(make_current=True)` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message shows that the `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is raised due to a violation of the logic in the `initialize` function.
   
### Bug Cause:
The bug occurs because the `initialize` function is not correctly handling the case when `make_current` is `True`. It should first check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function to check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making these changes, the corrected `initialize` function will first check if an `IOLoop` instance already exists before trying to make it the current instance. This will ensure that only one instance can be the current instance at a time.
