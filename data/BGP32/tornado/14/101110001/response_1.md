## Analysis:
The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is not behaving as expected in the provided test case. The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, but due to the logic in the `initialize` function, the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is failing incorrectly, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised.

## Potential Error Location:
The issue lies in the conditional checks inside the `initialize` function where it checks for the presence of an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

## Cause of the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect logic in the `initialize` function. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `elif` block should not prevent the current `IOLoop` instance from being created when `make_current=True`. This condition wrongly raises a `RuntimeError` when the test expects the second `IOLoop` instance to be created successfully with `make_current=True`.

## Strategy for Fixing:
To fix the bug, we should remove the conditional check for an existing `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`. This will allow the test case to successfully create the second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`.

## Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

By removing the unnecessary conditional check in the `elif` block, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case.
