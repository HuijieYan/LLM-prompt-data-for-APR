### Analysis:
- The buggy function is `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class.
- The failing test `test_force_current` in the test file `ioloop_test.py` is trying to force existing `IOLoop` instance as current, but the current implementation of the `initialize` function doesn't handle this scenario correctly.
- The error message indicates that when trying to make a new `IOLoop` instance current, it raises a `RuntimeError` because a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Bug Cause:
- The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class doesn't handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists correctly.
- When the `make_current` flag is set to `True`, the function should check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does, it should raise an error.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug in the `initialize` function:
1. Check if a current `IOLoop` instance exists before attempting to make a new instance current.
2. If a current instance exists and `make_current` flag is set to `True`, raise a `RuntimeError`.
3. Only make the new instance current if the above conditions are met.

### Corrected Version:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By applying the above changes, the corrected version of the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the scenario where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This should allow the failing test to pass successfully.
