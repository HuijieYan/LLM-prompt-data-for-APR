1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is called in the failing test `test_force_current`. The error message indicates that the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" is being raised when `make_current` is set to `True`.

2. The potential error location is in the `initialize` function where the conditional statement for `make_current` is being checked.

3. The cause of the bug is that the code is raising a RuntimeError when it shouldn't. The intention appears to be to only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists, but the code is incorrectly raising an error whenever `make_current` is `True`, regardless of the current IOLoop existence.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement so that the RuntimeError is only raised if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists. If `make_current` is `False`, then the function should make the current IOLoop.

5. Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
``` 

This corrected version of the `initialize` function checks if `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop already exists, only then raises a RuntimeError. Otherwise, it makes the current IOLoop.
