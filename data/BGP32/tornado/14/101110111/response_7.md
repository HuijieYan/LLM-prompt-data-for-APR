## Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of the IOLoop instance.
2. The `initialize` function checks the `make_current` parameter, and if it is `True`, it ensures that the current IOLoop instance does not already exist. If it does exist, it raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` is meant to test the scenario where `make_current=True` and ensure that a RuntimeError is raised if a current IOLoop instance already exists.
4. The error message indicates that the `RuntimeError` is being raised when there is already a current IOLoop instance, as expected.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location in the buggy function is the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` inside the `initialize` function. This condition checks if a current IOLoop exists by explicitly checking for `None`.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop instance. The buggy function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` in this case because it should only raise the error when `make_current` is `True` and a current IOLoop instance does not exist.

## Solution
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the condition where the `RuntimeError` is raised. We should only raise the error if `make_current` is `True` and there is a current IOLoop instance already in existence.

## Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After making this correction, the `initialize` function should now only raise a `RuntimeError` if `make_current=True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists. This change should resolve the issue described in the failing test and the corresponding GitHub issue.
