## Analyze the buggy function and related information

The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is designed to initialize an `IOLoop` instance. The function accepts a parameter `make_current`, which is a boolean indicating whether to make the current `IOLoop` instance. The bug occurs when `make_current` is `True`, and the function checks whether a current `IOLoop` instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`.

In the failing test `test_force_current`, an `IOLoop` instance is created with `make_current=True`, which should set this instance as the current `IOLoop`. However, the bug causes an exception to be raised even though the current `IOLoop` is not found to exist.

The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the conditional check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current` is `True`.

## Potential error location
The potential error lies in the conditional check when `make_current` is `True`. The code raises a `RuntimeError` if the current `IOLoop` instance is found to be `None`, but it should not raise an error in this case.

## Cause of the bug
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the condition when `make_current` is `True`. The code mistakenly raises an error if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None`, even though the intention is to set the current `IOLoop` instance in this situation.

## Fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should set the instance as the current `IOLoop` if no current instance exists. If a current instance already exists, it should not raise an error.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By adjusting the condition in the `elif` block to check if the current `IOLoop` instance is not `None`, we ensure that the error is only raised if a current `IOLoop` already exists when `make_current` is `True`.

This correction should address the issue identified in the failing test and provide the expected behavior for the `initialize` function.
