### Analyzing the buggy function and related test code
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is responsible for initializing the IOLoop instance.
2. The test function `test_force_current` checks whether creating two IOLoop instances with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The error message indicates that the `initialize` function raises a `RuntimeError` when `make_current` is `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.

### Identifying potential error locations
1. The condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check if an IOLoop instance already exists. 
2. The issue seems to be with how this condition is checked within the `initialize` function.

### Explaining the cause of the bug
1. The buggy function `initialize` incorrectly checks for the existence of an IOLoop instance. It checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, but this should mean no instance exists. So, when `make_current` is set to `True`, it mistakenly raises a `RuntimeError`.
2. The test function verifies this behavior by creating an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, expecting that a second instance creation with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Update the condition in the `initialize` function to correctly determine if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one.
2. Ensure that the `initialize` function works as expected when creating multiple instances with `make_current=True`.

### Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current() is not None:  # Check if IOLoop instance already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to correctly check if an IOLoop instance already exists or not, the bug can be fixed. Now, the corrected version should pass the failing test case mentioned.
