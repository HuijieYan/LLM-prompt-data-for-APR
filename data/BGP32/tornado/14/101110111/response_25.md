## Correction of the buggy function

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    @classmethod
    def current(cls):
        # Implementation of the current method, please replace it with actual logic

    def make_current(self):
        # Implementation of the make_current method, please replace it with actual logic

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if self.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if self.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the `initialize` function as shown above, the issue with the buggy code should be resolved. The correction involves checking if the `current` method returns `None` before attempting to make the current `IOLoop` instance. Additionally, when `make_current` is `True`, the function will correctly raise a `RuntimeError` if the current instance already exists.

This correction should align with the expected behavior and satisfy the conditions outlined in the failing test.
