## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to check whether the current `IOLoop` instance exists or not based on the `make_current` parameter passed.
2. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is set to `True` but the current instance already exists. In such a case, it should raise a `RuntimeError` as per the expected behavior.
3. The buggy function fails to correctly handle this scenario and erroneously raises the `RuntimeError` even when it is expected.
4. The issue seems to be related to incorrect logic in the `initialize` function where it should check if `make_current` is `True` and an instance already exists before raising an error.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly check if `make_current` is `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists before raising the `RuntimeError`.
2. Ensure that the `make_current` parameter is correctly handled based on the specified conditions.

## Corrected Code
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By modifying the condition in the `elif` block from `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`, the corrected version should be able to handle the scenario where `make_current` is set to `True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. This change ensures that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when necessary.
