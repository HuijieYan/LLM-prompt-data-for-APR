Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the failing test, the issue lies in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The problem occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as a parameter, triggering the conditional `if make_current`. However, the check for an existing current `IOLoop` instance is incorrect due to a logic error. The check should be for the existence of an instance before the current one before attempting to create a new current.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The fix involves changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `elif` block. This modification ensures that the `RuntimeError` is raised only when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

By applying this correction, the `initialize` function should now pass the failing test case provided, along with satisfying the expected input/output values.
