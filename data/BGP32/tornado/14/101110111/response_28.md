### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is supposed to handle the initialization of an `IOLoop` instance and ensure that only one current `IOLoop` instance exists at a time.
2. The bug occurs when `make_current=True` is passed as an argument to the `initialize` function, triggering the check for an already existing current `IOLoop`. However, in some cases, the check is failing to detect the existing `IOLoop` instance correctly.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expects it to become the current `IOLoop`, and then attempts to create another `IOLoop`. The bug causes the second `IOLoop` creation to fail incorrectly.
4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the logic for checking an existing current `IOLoop` instance works correctly in the `initialize` function.

### Bug Explanation:
The bug in the `initialize` function arises from how the existing `IOLoop` instance check is performed. When `make_current=True` is passed to the `initialize` function, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if there is no existing current `IOLoop`.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to update the logic within the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case when `make_current=True` is passed. The check for the existing current `IOLoop` instance needs to accurately detect whether such an instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic of the `initialize` function to correctly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance when `make_current=True`, the corrected version should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
