## Analysis:
1. The buggy function is `initialize` within the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.
2. The `initialize` function checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it ensures that there is no existing current instance before creating one.
3. The failing test `test_force_current` initializes an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects an exception to be raised if trying to create a second instance with the same parameter value.
4. The bug occurs when the `initialize` function incorrectly raises an exception when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.
   
## Bug:
The bug is in the `initialize` function where it raises a `RuntimeError` even when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

## Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic in the `initialize` function to correctly handle the scenario when `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By changing `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:`, we ensure that the `RuntimeError` is only raised when `make_current` is `True` and there is an existing current `IOLoop` instance.

This fix should resolve the bug and make the failing test `test_force_current` pass as expected.
