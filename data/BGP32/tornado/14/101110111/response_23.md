## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, it appears that the issue lies in the logic of the `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class. The function is supposed to initialize the IOLoop object and handle the case where a current IOLoop instance already exists.

The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to `True`, and the function incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` even if an IOLoop instance already exists. The logic should be modified to check if a current IOLoop instance exists before attempting to create a new one.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this adjustment, the function now correctly checks for an existing IOLoop instance before attempting to create a new one. This correction should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the failing test `test_force_current` passes successfully.
