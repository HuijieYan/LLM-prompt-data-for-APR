The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is causing an issue when `make_current` is set to `True` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, which leads to a `RuntimeError` being raised incorrectly.

### Error Cause:
The bug in the function lies in the logic when `make_current` is `True`. It checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, and if not, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though it is intended to make the current IOLoop instance.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, the logic in the `initialize` function needs to be corrected. Specifically, when `make_current` is `True`, it should not raise a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is already set. Instead, it should simply make the current instance without checking for existence.

### Corrected Version of the `initialize` function:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

By removing the check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`, the corrected function will set the IOLoop instance as intended without raising unnecessary errors.

This corrected version should now pass the failing test case `test_force_current` and be in line with the expected input/output values.
