## Correction of the buggy function

After analyzing the buggy function and the failing test, we can see that the `initialize` function is not handling the scenario where `make_current` parameter is `True` correctly. The issue arises when trying to initialize a new `IOLoop` object with `make_current=True`, but another `IOLoop` object already exists.

To correct this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` object already exists.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize` function will now properly check if a current `IOLoop` object already exists before attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
