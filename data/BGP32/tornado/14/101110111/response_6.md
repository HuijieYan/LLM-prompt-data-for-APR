### Analysis
1. The buggy function `initialize` checks if the `make_current` parameter is `True`. If it is, and the current IOLoop already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError` even though the intention might be to only prevent the make_current behavior if an IOLoop already exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create a new IOLoop with `make_current=True` and then asserts that the current IOLoop is the one just created. However, due to the buggy behavior described above, the second attempt to create an IOLoop with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The expected behavior should be to raise an error only when a new IOLoop creation is attempted with `make_current=True` and an IOLoop already exists.
4. To fix the bug, the logic of checking for the existence of an IOLoop before raising an error needs to be adjusted in the `initialize` function.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The bug can be fixed by modifying the logic in the `initialize` function to raise a `RuntimeError` only if `make_current` is `True`, and an IOLoop instance already exists. This will prevent the error when a new IOLoop instance is created with `make_current=True` after an existing IOLoop was the most recent one to be created.

### Corrected Version
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    @classmethod
    def current(cls, instance=True):
        # Implementation goes here

    def make_current(self):
        # Implementation goes here

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By changing the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` before raising the `RuntimeError` in the `initialize` function, we ensure that the error is only raised when a new IOLoop is being created with `make_current=True` and an existing one is already in place.
