## Analysis
1. The `initialize` function in the `IOLoop` class is meant to initialize the current IOLoop instance. The bug occurs when the `make_current` parameter is `True` and an attempt is made to initialize a second IOLoop instance.
2. The buggy function fails the test case where `make_current` is set to `True` and an IOLoop instance already exists.
3. The bug is caused by the logic in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it should check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one. However, the current logic only checks if an instance is present after calling `self.make_current()`. This leads to the `RuntimeError` if an instance already exists.
4. To fix the bug, we need to first check if an IOLoop instance exists before attempting to make the current instance. If an instance already exists and `make_current` is `True`, we should raise an error.
5. Below is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making the necessary adjustments as described above, the `initialize` function should now correctly handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance already exists and `make_current` is set to `True`.
