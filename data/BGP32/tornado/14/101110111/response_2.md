### Correction of the buggy function

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            # Check if a current IOLoop instance already exists
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

### Explanation:
- The bug in the original `initialize` function was due to incorrect condition checks. It was checking if `IOLoop.current()` is `None`, and if true, trying to create a new IOLoop instance. This logic was flawed as it should be checking if an IOLoop instance already exists before creating a new one.
- In the corrected version, the condition checks have been updated to properly verify if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition checks in the `initialize` function to properly verify if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to create a new one.
2. Raise a `RuntimeError` if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is set to True.

By making these changes, the corrected `initialize` function will handle the scenario where an IOLoop instance is already present correctly.

The corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output values.
