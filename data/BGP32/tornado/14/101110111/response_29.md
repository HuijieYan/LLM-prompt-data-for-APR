### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists by calling `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. If an instance exists, it should raise a `RuntimeError`. However, the issue arises because the condition checks if the returned value is `None`, which is incorrect. 
   
2. In the failing test `test_force_current`, it creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. The test expects that trying to create a second `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` should raise a `RuntimeError`. This test fails due to the buggy behavior described above.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is caused by `initialize` function incorrectly checking if the current `IOLoop` instance is `None` to determine if a new instance can be created. This check is incorrect and leads to the `RuntimeError`.

### Fix Strategy:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check in the `initialize` function to correctly determine if an `IOLoop` instance already exists regardless of its value.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current() is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

After correcting the bug in the `initialize` function, the provided failing test `test_force_current` should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError`.
