### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the `make_current` parameter is `None` or not. If it is `None`, it checks if there is a current `IOLoop` instance and if not, calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raises a `RuntimeError` if there is.
  
2. The failing test `test_force_current` tries to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and asserts its current value. Then, it attempts to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting a `RuntimeError` to be raised.

3. The failing occurs because the buggy `initialize` function does not handle the case where the `IOLoop` is already current, resulting in a wrong `RuntimeError` being raised.

### Bug Explanation:
- In the failing test, when creating the first `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, the `initialize` function is called with `make_current` as `True`. Inside the function, it checks if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance. Since the first instance is already set as the current instance, the check fails and the `initialize` function wrongly raises a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug Fix:
- To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `initialize` function to ensure that when `make_current=True` is passed and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance, it does not raise an error.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        pass

    def make_current(self):
        pass

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the logic in the `initialize` function as shown above, the corrected function will handle the case where the `IOLoop` is already the current instance when `make_current=True` is passed. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and make the failing test pass.
