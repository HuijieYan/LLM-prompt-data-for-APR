### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists before setting a new one. If `make_current` parameter is not provided, it checks if the current instance is `None` and then calls the `make_current` method. If `make_current` is provided as `True`, it checks if the current instance is `None` and raises an error if it's not.
   
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, ensures that it becomes the current instance, and then tries to create another `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, expecting it to raise a `RuntimeError`.

### Bug:
The bug in the `initialize` function causes the error to be raised incorrectly. When `make_current=True` is passed, it checks if an `IOLoop` instance already exists when it should only check if it doesn't exist. This leads to the erroneous `RuntimeError` being raised when creating a new `IOLoop` even though it's expected behavior.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to adjust the conditional check for `make_current=True` to only proceed if there is no existing `IOLoop` instance. We should remove the check for an existing instance when `make_current=True`.

### Corrected code:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:               # Fixed condition to check existing instance for error
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will correctly only raise an error when trying to set a new `IOLoop` instance as the current one when no instance currently exists.
