To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, we need to update the logic to handle the case where `make_current=True` correctly. The issue arises because the current implementation does not check if an IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make it current.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
        elif make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation of the changes:
- The condition `if make_current:` now checks if `make_current` is `True`, and then it checks if an IOLoop instance already exists. If it does, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
- In the `elif` block, when `make_current` is not specified (`None`), we check if there is no current IOLoop instance, then we make the IOLoop current.

This corrected version should pass the failing test case provided, and it aligns with the expected behavior based on the detailed description and the value types for the expected case.
