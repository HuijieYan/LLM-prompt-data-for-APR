To fix the bug in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class in `tornado/ioloop.py`, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles the case when `make_current=True` is provided as a parameter. 

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def make_current(self):
        # Please ignore the body of this function

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

Explanation of the bug and the fix:
- The bug was in the `initialize` function logic when `make_current=True` was provided as a parameter. The original code was raising an error if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` was `None`, which was incorrect. The correct condition should be when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`.
- The corrected code updates the condition for checking if the current `IOLoop` already exists, by changing the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None`.
- This fix ensures that the `initialize` function correctly handles the case when `make_current=True` is provided as a parameter, preventing the `RuntimeError` from being raised incorrectly.

With this correction, the failing test case `test_force_current` should now pass without raising a `RuntimeError` for an existing `IOLoop`.
