### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize(self, make_current=None)` checks if a current instance of `IOLoop` exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it should only create a new instance if there is no current instance. If `make_current` is `None`, it should only create a new instance if there is no current instance.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` creates an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, then tries to create another instance with `make_current=True` again, which should raise a `RuntimeError` as per the test.
3. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the logic to check and raise an error if an `IOLoop` instance already exists with `make_current=True`.

### Bug Cause:
The buggy function does not handle the case where `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists. It incorrectly allows the creation of another instance in this scenario, leading to the `RuntimeError` being raised when it shouldn't.

### Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists.
2. Add logic to check if an `IOLoop` instance is already present before creating a new one with `make_current=True`.
3. If an instance already exists and `make_current=True`, raise a `RuntimeError` indicating that the current `IOLoop` already exists.

### Corrected Function:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    def current(instance=True):
        # unchanged

    def make_current(self):
        # unchanged

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

The corrected version of the `initialize` function will handle the case where `make_current=True` and an `IOLoop` instance already exists correctly, ensuring that a `RuntimeError` is raised in that scenario.

By applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test and the expected input/output values should align as specified.
