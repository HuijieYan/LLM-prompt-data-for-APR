### Analysis:
1. The buggy function `initialize` in the `IOLoop` class is intended to set the current `IOLoop` instance. If `make_current` is `True`, it should check if there is already a current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if one exists.
2. The failing test `test_force_current` is trying to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`, verify that it matches the current instance, and then ensure that creating a second instance with `make_current=True` raises a `RuntimeError`.
3. The failing test fails because the initial call to `IOLoop(make_current=True)` creates a new `IOLoop` instance even if there is already a current instance, violating the expected behavior.

### Bug:
The bug lies in the condition checks inside the `initialize` function. When `make_current=True`, the code does not properly check if a current `IOLoop` instance already exists before creating a new one, leading to the error being raised incorrectly.

### Fix:
To fix the bug, we need to update the condition check when `make_current=True` to properly handle the case when a current `IOLoop` instance already exists.

### Corrected Version:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # Other functions as before

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By correcting the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` in the `initialize` function, the issue of creating a new `IOLoop` instance even when one is already present is fixed. This change ensures that the error is only raised if a current `IOLoop` instance exists when attempting to create a new one with `make_current=True`.
