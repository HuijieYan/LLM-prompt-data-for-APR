Looking at the error message, it appears that the issue in the buggy function is likely due to the fact that under certain conditions, `table` is being returned as a Series and not a DataFrame, causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access its columns.

The cause of the bug is that in the final return statement, `table` may sometimes become a Series instead of a DataFrame when the conditions for returning a single value are met, and thus the subsequent operation on `table.columns` results in an `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, it would be necessary to ensure that the return value from the function is always a DataFrame.

Here's the fixed and corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # ... (rest of the function)

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        # Convert to DataFrame if it's a Series
        table = DataFrame(table)

    return table
```

In this fixed version, after all the operations and checks have been performed on `table`, it is explicitly checked whether `table` is an instance of a Series. If it is, the code converts it to a DataFrame before returning it to ensure that the subsequent operations will not result in an `AttributeError`.
