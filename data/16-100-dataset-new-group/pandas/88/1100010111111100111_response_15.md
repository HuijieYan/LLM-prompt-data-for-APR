To fix the bug in the `pivot_table` function, we need to account for multi-index columns when creating the pivot table. Currently, the bug arises from a conditional statement that checks if the number of levels in the table's columns is greater than 1. This conditional statement does not take into account the case of multi-index columns, resulting in the AttributeError for 'Series' object.

To fix this bug, we can refactor the section of the code that handles the conditional check for the number of levels in the table's columns. Specifically, we need to consider the case of multi-index columns and modify the conditional check to account for this scenario.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code remains unchanged

    # existing code

    table = agged
    if table.columns.nlevels > 1 and table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # If both the index and columns have multiple levels,
        # the table should be returned as is, without attempting to filter based on the number of levels.
        pass
    elif table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        # If only the columns have multiple levels,
        # discard the top level from the columns
        table = table.droplevel(0, axis=1)
    
    # existing code

    return table
```

The fix involves adding a conditional block to handle the case where the columns have multiple levels. If both the index and columns have multiple levels, the function should avoid applying any manipulation to the table. If only the columns have multiple levels, the function should drop the top level from the columns. This approach ensures that the pivot table function correctly handles multi-index columns.

Applying this fix should address the reported bug and allow the `pivot_table` function to handle multi-index columns as expected, resolving the GitHub issue.
