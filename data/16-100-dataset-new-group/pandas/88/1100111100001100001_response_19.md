The bug in the provided function is that it calls itself recursively, causing an infinite loop. This is due to the nested `pivot_table` function call within the `if isinstance(aggfunc, list)` block.

To fix the bug, the recursive call to `pivot_table` needs to be replaced with a different approach. One possible strategy is to create a loop to iterate through the list of `aggfunc` values, and then concatenate the resulting tables at the end.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# other imports

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)

        return concat(pieces, keys=aggfunc, axis=1)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

By iterating through the list of `aggfunc` values, aggregating the data for each value, and then concatenating the results, we avoid the recursive call and resolve the bug.

This corrected version should resolve the infinite loop and successfully aggregate values for the given input parameters.
