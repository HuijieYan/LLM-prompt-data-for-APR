The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the recursive call to the `pivot_table` function when `aggfunc` is a list. This recursive call is causing incorrect behavior and unexpected results in the subsequent operations.

The issue is that when `aggfunc` is a list, the function recursively calls itself to create individual pivot tables for each function in the list. However, this approach leads to incorrect behavior, as each recursive call should modify only the subset of the data corresponding to the current pivot table configuration. Instead, the function is not correctly isolating the subsets of data for each recursive call, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the case when `aggfunc` is a list without recursively calling itself. Instead, we should iterate over the functions in `aggfunc`, applying each one separately and combining the results into the final output.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []

        grouped_data = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)

        for func in aggfunc:
            agged = grouped_data.agg(func)
            table = agged

            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

                for v in values:
                    if (
                        v in data
                        and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                        and v in agged
                        and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                    ):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

                table = agged

            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we first create a group from the data using `groupby` and then iterate over the functions in `aggfunc`, creating the aggregated table for each function. We then combine these tables using `concat` to produce the final output.

This approach ensures that each aggregation function in the list is applied separately and correctly, avoiding the need for unnecessary recursive calls and isolating the data subsets for each function.
