The issue arises in the `pivot_table` function when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns only. The issue occurs due to asymmetrical behavior between rows and columns and single- and multi-case scenarios.

### Bug in the Code
The bug occurs when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns only, resulting in a `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` error. This error happens when the `table` variable is a Series instead of a DataFrame, leading the subsequent operation (`table.columns.nlevels`) to fail.

### Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the failure to handle the case where `table` is a Series instead of a DataFrame when executing `table.columns.nlevels`.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug
To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle the case where `table` is a Series, ensuring that the necessary operations can still be performed without assuming the input variable datatype.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (rest of the function's logic remains the same) ...

    if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):  # Handle the case where table is a Series
        table = DataFrame(table)

    if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.droplevel(0, axis=1)

    # ... (remaining logic of the function) ...
```

In the modified code, after `table` is computed, it is explicitly converted to a DataFrame (`DataFrame(table)`) if it is not already an ABCDataFrame. Then, before performing operations on the columns, it is checked if `table.columns.nlevels` is greater than 1. If true, the top level is dropped from the columns using `table.droplevel`.

This modification ensures that the function can handle cases where `table` is a Series and performs the necessary operations to handle multi-index columns correctly.

Please note that you need to replace the existing `pivot.py` file in the `pandas/core/reshape/` directory with this corrected version of the function. After fixing the function, run the failing test cases to verify that the issue has been resolved.
