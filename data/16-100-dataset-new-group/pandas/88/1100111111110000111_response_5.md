After analyzing the buggy function, its relationship with related functions, and the failing test, the cause of the bug seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function encountering an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` when using multi-index columns. The issue is related to the `table.columns.nlevels` condition in the `pivot_table` function.

The bug can be fixed by checking if `table` is a DataFrame before checking for nlevels to avoid the AttributeError that occurs when `table` is a Series. Additionally, the fix should handle multi-index columns correctly to ensure that it doesn't cause an issue when using the `pivot_table` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(table, DataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    return table
```

The fixed code explicitly checks if `table` is a DataFrame before checking for nlevels to avoid the AttributeError when `table` is a Series, and it handles multi-index columns correctly. This updated code should resolve the issue and prevent the AttributeError related to 'Series' object not having the 'columns' attribute.
