The bug in the `pivot_table` function occurs when the input `columns` parameter is of the tuple type. This leads to errors when attempting to pivot the table and results in an incorrect output. The issue on GitHub raises the error message and also provides the expected output for a multi-index input that is seamless between rows/columns and single/multi cases.

The bug in the function is likely related to how the `columns` variable is handled. The `columns` variable is expected to be a list, but when a tuple is passed as input, it causes issues with the subsequent operations, leading to incorrect output or an error.

To resolve this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `columns` parameter is of the tuple type and convert it into a list before further processing takes place. This modification will ensure that the `columns` variable is always in the expected format for the function to execute without errors and produce the correct output.

The corrected version of the `pivot_table` function is provided below:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)
    
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)  # Convert the tuple to a list
    
    # remaining code remains the same...
```

In the corrected version, an additional check is implemented to detect if the `columns` parameter is a tuple, and if so, it is converted to a list before being used further in the function. This ensures that the `columns` variable is always in the appropriate format, preventing the bug from occurring.

By making this modification, the `pivot_table` function will handle the input of tuples for the `columns` parameter without causing errors and will produce the expected output as described in the GitHub issue.
