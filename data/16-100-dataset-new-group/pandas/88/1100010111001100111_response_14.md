The issue seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function when using multi-index columns only. The specific error message is related to a `Series` object not having the attribute 'columns'.

Upon reviewing the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems like the issue occurs when trying to access the columns attribute of the table, which may not be appropriate for Series objects.

The strategy for fixing the bug could involve adding a conditional check to handle the case when the `table` variable is a Series, and then accessing the necessary information accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# The corrected version of pivot_table function
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Index
import pandas.testing as tm

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
) -> DataFrame:

    # ... (rest of the function)

    if not isinstance(table, list):
        table = [table]

    if not isinstance(table[0], DataFrame):
        table[0] = table[0].to_frame()

    if table[0].empty:
        return table[0]

    if not isinstance(table[0].columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        table[0].columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([("", col) for col in table[0].columns])

    return concat(table)
```

The changes involve handling the `table` variable as a list, and then converting the Series object to a DataFrame before proceeding. Additionally, there's a conditional check to set a MultiIndex for columns if it's not already a MultiIndex.

This corrected version should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report and successfully pass the failing test cases.
