The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the handling of multi-index columns when using `df2.pivot_table(values='v', columns=('k1','k2'))`, as indicated in the GitHub issue "BUG/API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only".

Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring when the function tries to access `.columns` on the result of the pivot operation, which leads to an AttributeError.

Cause of the Bug:
The cause of the bug appears to be that when the pivot operation results in multi-level column indices, the subsequent handling in the function is causing an AttributeError when attempting to access `.columns` on the result, which is a Series and does not have a `.columns` attribute.

Bug Fix Strategy:
1. Modify the function to handle multi-level column indices correctly.
2. Ensure that the resulting output from the pivot operation is properly transformed into a DataFrame with multi-level columns.

Fixed Version of the Function:
Based on the analysis, the following is a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby import Grouper
from pandas import DataFrame, Series, MultiIndex, Index

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> DataFrame:
    # existing code

    # ... (previous code)

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        table.columns = table.columns.droplevel()
    
    return table
```

In the corrected version, after performing the pivot operation, the function directly accesses the `table.columns` to adjust the columns if they have multiple levels. The `droplevel` method is used to remove one level from the columns, ensuring that the resulting output is symmetrical and free from an AttributeError caused by accessing `table.columns.nlevels > 1` without proper handling.
