To fix the bug in the `pivot_table` function, we need to address the AttributeError:
`AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`

This error is occurring when the `table` variable is a `Series` object rather than a `DataFrame`. This happens at the following line in the buggy function:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```

The `table` variable is presumed to be a `DataFrame` in this line, but for the failing test cases it is a `Series` object, which doesn't have a `columns` attribute.

The logic to create the `table` object is likely causing this error and needs to be adjusted. It's evident that the function is intended to return a `DataFrame` rather than a `Series` in this context.

The issue on GitHub also provides a similar test case which calls `pivot_table` with multi-index columns, so it aligns with our failing tests. We need to ensure the the fix resolves both the failing tests and the examples mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The fix will involve modifying the logic used to create the `table` object in the `pivot_table` function to ensure it returns a `DataFrame` with not just the expected data, but also the expected structure.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> "DataFrame":
    # body of the function

    # Replace the table generation logic to properly return a DataFrame for consistency
    
    # Replace this line:
    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
    
    # With this block of code:
    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame):  # Check if the result is a DataFrame
        table = agged
    else:
        # If agged is a Series, create a DataFrame from it
        table = agged.to_frame()

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
    # body of the function
```

By adjusting the logic used to create the `table` object, we ensure that it always returns a `DataFrame` regardless of the input and the calculation results. This aligns with the expected output and should resolve the errors.
