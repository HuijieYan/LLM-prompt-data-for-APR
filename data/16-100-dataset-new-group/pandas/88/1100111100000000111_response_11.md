The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. This bug specifically occurs when calling the `pivot_table` function with `values='v'` and `columns=('k1','k2')`. The issue arises from the following block of code:
```python
# discard the top level
if (
    values_passed
    and not values_multi
    and not table.empty
    and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
):
    table = table[values[0]]
```
The problem occurs because it incorrectly assumes that when `table.columns.nlevels > 1`, the result is a DataFrame. In certain cases, the `table` variable turns out to be a Series, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access `table.columns`.

To fix this bug, we need to check whether `table` is a DataFrame or a Series before trying to access its columns. Additionally, we need to ensure that the multi-index structure is preserved when accessing the columns.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()

    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[table.columns[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return table
```
In the corrected version, we first check if `table` is an instance of `ABCSeries` (pandas Series). If it is, we convert it to a DataFrame using the `to_frame` method. Then, when discarding the top level, we access the columns using `table.columns[0]` to ensure the multi-index structure is preserved.

This should resolve the `AttributeError` and fix the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
