The bug in the given function is that it is calling itself recursively, which is not the intended behavior. The function is meant to call the `pivot_table` function from within the same file, but it mistakenly ends up calling itself.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary recursive call to `pivot_table` within a loop, which is causing the function to call itself multiple times.
2. Rename the `pivot_table` function inside the file to something else to avoid confusion and potential recursive calls.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# Renamed the function to avoid confusion
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def custom_pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        # Rest of the function remains the same...
```

In the corrected version, I've renamed the function to `custom_pivot_table` to avoid confusion and potential recursive calls. This version should resolve the issue and prevent the recursive call, which was the cause of the bug.
