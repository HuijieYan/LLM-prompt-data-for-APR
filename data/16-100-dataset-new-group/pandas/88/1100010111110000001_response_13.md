The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError when the `pivot_table` function is called with `columns` that are not tuple-like (i.e., any non-integer/non-string). The code is assuming that `columns` will always be tuple-like, but this assumption is incorrect.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to first check if the `columns` parameter is tuple-like, and if not, convert it to a tuple before proceeding with further operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (unchanged)

    keys = index + columns

    # New check to ensure columns is tuple-like
    if not isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = (columns,)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

The added check ensures that if `columns` is not a tuple, it will be converted into a single-element tuple before further processing. This correction addresses the main cause of the bug.

With this fix, the `pivot_table` function should pass the failing test cases.
