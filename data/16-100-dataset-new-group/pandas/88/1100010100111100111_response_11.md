## Bug Analysis
The bug causes the `pivot_table` function to throw an `AttributeError` on a specific set of input values, specifically when using multi-index columns. The bug occurs when the function encounters `table.columns.nlevels` in a situation where `table` is a Series, thus leading to an AttributeError.

The bug appears to be related to the case where `table` is a Series instead of a DataFrame, which causes the error when attempting to access `table.columns.nlevels`.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely to be in the section of the code that is responsible for generating the output when `table.columns.nlevels > 1` but `table` is actually a Series. This discrepancy in the type of `table` is causing the AttributeError.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle the case where `table` is a Series instead of a DataFrame. This leads to an AttributeError when the function tries to access an attribute, `columns`, that does not exist on a Series.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function handles the case where `table` is a Series differently from when it is a DataFrame. By checking the type of `table` before trying to access its columns, the function can avoid the attribute error.

## Bug Fix
The corrected version of the `pivot_table` function is provided below, with additional error-handling logic to handle the case when `table` is a Series:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Revised logic to handle case where table is a Series
    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        # Convert to DataFrame with single column
        table = DataFrame(table, columns=[getattr(table, "name", None)])
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)
    
    # ... (the remaining code remains unchanged)

    return table
```

This revised version of the function handles the case when `table` is a Series by converting it to a DataFrame with a single column before proceeding with other operations. This should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
