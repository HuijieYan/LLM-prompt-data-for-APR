The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be occurring due to recursive call when `aggfunc` is a list. This recursive call is not correctly handling the input and not properly aggregating the data as expected, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the recursive call inside the condition where `aggfunc` is a list should be replaced with a loop that iterates through each function in `aggfunc` and aggregates the data separately for each function. Once the aggregations are done, the results should be concatenated effectively before returning.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
import pandas as pd

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

                for v in values if isinstance(values, list) else [values]:
                    if (
                        is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                        and v in agged
                        and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                    ):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        table = concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    else:
        # Original functionality when aggfunc is not a list
        # ... (remaining code from the original function)

    return table
```

In this corrected version, the recursive call has been replaced with a loop to iterate through each function in `aggfunc`, aggregate the data separately, and then concatenate the results before returning. This should effectively handle the case when `aggfunc` is a list and fix the bug.
