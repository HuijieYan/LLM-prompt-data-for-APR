The bug in the `pivot_table` function is related to the case when the `columns` parameter consists of a multi-index. The issue arises when the pivot table values are attempted to be accessed using `table.columns`, causing an AttributeError if `table` is a Series.

The cause of the bug lies within the following code:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```
The bug occurs when `table` is a Series, as it does not have a `columns` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `pivot_table` function needs to be modified to properly handle cases when `table` is a Series.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (previous implementation)

    # Replace the current problematic code with a check for the type of table
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (rest of the implementation)
```

In this corrected version, an additional check is added to see if `table` is a Series, in which case it is converted to a DataFrame using the `to_frame()` method. This will ensure that the subsequent operations on `table` are performed consistently.

Applying this fix should resolve the bug and allow the `pivot_table` function to handle multi-index columns without raising an AttributeError.
