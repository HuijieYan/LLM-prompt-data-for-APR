The buggy function is the `pivot_table` function from the pandas library. This function is supposed to pivot a DataFrame based on some specified criteria. The bug arises when the `aggfunc` parameter is a list, causing the function to recursively call itself, leading to infinite recursion and ultimately a stack overflow.

The issue is with the block of code that checks if `aggfunc` is a list. When `aggfunc` is a list, the function calls itself recursively in a loop, causing a stack overflow.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case when `aggfunc` is a list differently. Instead of making a recursive call, the function should iterate through the list of `aggfunc` and apply them one by one, and then concatenate the results. Additionally, we should remove the recursive call when `aggfunc` is a list to prevent infinite recursion.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = data.pivot_table(
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)

        return concat(pieces, axis=1)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, when `aggfunc` is a list, the function iterates through the list, applies each function one by one, and then concatenates the results using the `concat` function. This approach avoids the infinite recursion issue and provides the expected behavior for handling multiple aggregation functions.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and provide the expected functionality for the `pivot_table` function.
