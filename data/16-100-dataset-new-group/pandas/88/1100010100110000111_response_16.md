The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError when using multi-index columns. Specifically, the error occurs at this check:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```
The specific error is `'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`, which occurs because the `table` object is a Series and does not have a `columns` attribute.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the code to check if `table` is not empty and has more than one level before attempting to access the `columns` attribute. This will prevent the AttributeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (previous code)

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and table.index.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.unstack()

    # ... (remaining code)
```
By changing the condition to `if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and table.index.nlevels > 1`, we can prevent the AttributeError when dealing with multi-index columns.

This corrected version of the `pivot_table` function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test cases.
