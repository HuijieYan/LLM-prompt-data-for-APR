The bug in the `pivot_table` function is related to the handling of multi-index columns only. When trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns, the function fails with an AttributeError.

### Analysis of the Buggy Function and the Failing Test
The buggy function `pivot_table` is intended to pivot a DataFrame based on given values, index, columns, and aggregation function. However, when attempting to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns only, the function raises an AttributeError due to an assumption about the data structure that does not hold true in this specific case. This causes the failing test to produce an error when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns.

### Identifying Potential Error Locations in the Buggy Function
The error is likely occurring in the block of code which checks whether `table.columns.nlevels` is greater than 1.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the assumption that `table` (a DataFrame) will always have `columns` attribute when the pivot operation involves multi-index columns. This assumption is not accurate for this specific use case, leading to the AttributeError.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case of multi-index columns more gracefully. Specifically, we need to check the type of `table`, and if it is a Series, handle it differently.

### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Index
import pandas as pd

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (existing function code)

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)

        # Handle Series case
        if not isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame) and isinstance(table.index, MultiIndex):
            table = table.unstack(to_unstack)
        elif not dropna and isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame):
            table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (remaining original code)
    return table
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `pivot_table` function includes a conditional check to handle the case when `table` is a Series and has a MultiIndex structure. In this case, the function directly unstacks the Series to obtain a DataFrame structure. Additionally, if the condition for handling `table` as a Series does not hold and `table` is a DataFrame, it proceeds with the original logic for unstacking the DataFrame based on the index levels.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the AttributeError and allow the `pivot_table` function to handle the given test case and the GitHub issue successfully.
