The issue seems to be caused by a recursive call to the `pivot_table` function within itself when `aggfunc` is a list. This recursive call causes the function to behave unexpectedly and produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified so that the `pivot_table` function doesn't call itself when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead, it should iteratively calculate the pivot tables for each aggregation function in the list and concatenate the resulting tables.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby([index, columns], observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function will no longer exhibit unexpected behavior when `aggfunc` is a list, and it should correctly handle the different aggregation functions without calling itself recursively. This should resolve the issues observed in the failing test cases.
