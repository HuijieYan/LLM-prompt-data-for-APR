Based on the error message and the failing tests, it appears that the issue lies in trying to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object. This implies that the `table` variable is a Series instead of a DataFrame, leading to the 'columns' attribute error.

The root cause of this bug is the conditional check in the line 174:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```

The `table` variable is being replaced with a single column (Series) when the condition is met. This introduces the error where a subsequent call to `table.columns` fails, as it assumes `table` to be a DataFrame.

To address this bug, the conditional check and the subsequent manipulation of the `table` variable need to be revised. Instead of replacing the `table` DataFrame with a Series, it should be modified in a way that preserves its DataFrame structure.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function with the bug fixed:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other function code)

    if values_passed:
        # ... (other function code)

        if table.empty and values_passed and not isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)):
            table = table.unstack()

    # ... (other function code)

    return table
```

In the corrected version, the conditional check in the line 174 has been modified to retain the DataFrame structure of the `table` variable when the condition is met. This is achieved by calling the `unstack` method on the `table` to convert it to a DataFrame with a MultiIndex, instead of replacing it with a Series.

With this correction, the code should now handle the pivot table operation with multi-index columns correctly, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub community.
