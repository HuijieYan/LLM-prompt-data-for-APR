The bug in the code is that the function calls itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list, which leads to incorrect results and unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to change the logic so that it doesn't call itself when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead, we need to handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list by iterating through each function in the list and aggregating the data separately for each function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same as before
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, we no longer call `pivot_table` recursively when `aggfunc` is a list. Instead, we iterate through each function in the list, aggregate the data separately for each function, and concatenate the results into a single DataFrame.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected when `aggfunc` is a list.
