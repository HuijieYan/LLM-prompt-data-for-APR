The buggy function `pivot_table` contains potential errors that need to be fixed. One of the main issues is the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function, which could cause unexpected behavior and lead to errors. Additionally, there are several conditional checks and data manipulations that might not behave as intended, resulting in incorrect outputs or crashes.

To fix the bug, it's important to remove the recursive call to `pivot_table` and instead use a different approach for handling multiple aggregated functions. This can be achieved by refactoring the code to handle the different aggregation functions without the need for recursive calls.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame

def pivot_table_fix(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # Correct the usage of _convert_by function
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Check if aggfunc is a list of functions and handle it accordingly
    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)

        return concat(pieces, axis=1)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

```

In this corrected version, the recursive call to `pivot_table` has been removed, and the handling of multiple aggregated functions has been refactored without the need for recursion. This should address the potential errors and unexpected behavior in the original function.
