## Analysis
The error message is related to the `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`. It indicates that a Series is being treated as a DataFrame and the `columns` attribute is being accessed. The error message points to the line `and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)` in the `pivot_table` function of the file `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`.

## Bug
The bug is occurring because the `table` variable is a Series (created after a combination of index and cols), and being accessed with an attribute `columns` that Series don't have.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` variable is converted to a DataFrame before accessing its columns.

## The corrected version
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... other parts of the function

    if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = DataFrame(table)

    if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        # ... the rest of the function

    return table
```
