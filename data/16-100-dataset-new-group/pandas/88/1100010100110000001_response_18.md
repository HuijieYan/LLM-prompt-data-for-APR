The issue is caused by the `Series` object not having the attribute 'columns'. This error occurs when accessing the attribute 'columns' in the `pivot_table` function.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the type of the `table` variable, which is assigned in the function, is always a DataFrame and not a Series.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    # other arguments...
) -> "DataFrame":
    # previous code...

    # existing code...
    
    # start of the corrected code
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = DataFrame(table)
    
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # This part of the code can remain the same
    
    # end of the corrected code

    # remaining code...

    return table
```

In the corrected version, after the 'table' variable is created, we added an additional check to ensure that it's a DataFrame. If it's a Series, we convert it to a DataFrame. This prevents the AttributeError when accessing the 'columns' attribute of a Series. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
