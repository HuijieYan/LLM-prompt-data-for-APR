Based on the failing test functions and the error messages, the main issue seems to be occurring when creating the DataFrame with MultiIndex columns. As discovered from the failing test, the error "AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'" was raised, indicating the function was expecting a DataFrame and not a Series type.

The bug in the function is that when checking for `if isinstance(aggfunc, list):`, the function recursively calls itself but doesn't take into account that it may return a Series instead of a DataFrame.

To fix the bug, we need to change the recursive call within the `isinstance(aggfunc, list):` block to return a DataFrame instead of a Series if a Series is returned.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):  # Check if the result is a Series
                table = table.to_frame()  # Convert Series to DataFrame
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same...
```
