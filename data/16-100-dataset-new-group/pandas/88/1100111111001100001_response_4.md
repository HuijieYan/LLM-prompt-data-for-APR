The bug in the given function is likely related to the nested call to `pivot_table` when `aggfunc` is a list. This nested call constructs a dataframe using a concatenation process. However, because the keys are not properly updated when calling `pivot_table`, it results in an incorrect concatenation. This leads to incorrect test results and indicates that the concatenation process is not adhering to the expected output structure.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the keys are properly handled when calling `pivot_table` recursively. We can pass the correct keys to the nested `pivot_table` call based on the original input `index` and `columns`.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = index + columns  # Update keys based on the original input
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data=data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
        
        # Concatenate along the correct axis and with the correct keys
        result = concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)  # Concatenate along the correct axis and with the correct keys
        return result

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
``` 

With this change, the keys are properly updated based on the original input `index` and `columns`, ensuring that the nested `pivot_table` calls operate correctly. This should address the concatenation issues and resolve the failing tests.

Please integrate this fixed version into the relevant codebase to address the bug.
