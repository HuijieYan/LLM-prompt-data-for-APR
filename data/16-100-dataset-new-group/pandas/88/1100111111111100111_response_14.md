## Issue Analysis
The failing test cases and the GitHub issue provide the following insights into the buggy function:
1. When using `pivot_table` with multi-index columns, an AttributeError occurs when checking for `table.columns.nlevels > 1`.
2. The failing test cases and GitHub issue show that the error happens for both single and multi-index pivoting, indicating that the issue is not restricted to a specific type of input.
3. The error appears to be related to Series objects not having an attribute called 'columns'.

The root cause of the issue is that the `pivot_table` implementation does not handle multi-index columns correctly, which leads to attribute errors during the column-level checks.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix the bug in the `pivot_table` function, the following actions can be taken:
1. Modify the logic that checks for multi-index columns so that it can handle both single and multi-index scenarios without throwing an error.
2. Specifically handle the cases where the input columns are of type tuple, which are used to represent multi-index columns.

## Bug Fix - Corrected Version

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Piecewise aggregation routine
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        columns = list(columns)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... remaining implementation
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the provided columns are a tuple. If so, it converts the columns to a list, making the logic consistent with handling both single and multi-index columns. This change ensures that subsequent operations on the columns will behave correctly in cases where column deduplication or level adjustments are required.

With this correction, the `pivot_table` function should handle multi-index columns correctly and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
