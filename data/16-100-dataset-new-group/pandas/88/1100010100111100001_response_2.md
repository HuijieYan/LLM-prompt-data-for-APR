Looking at the error messages and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue occurs when the 'table' variable is a Series and not a DataFrame, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute.

The bug is likely caused by incorrect formatting of the output, leading to unexpected types of the 'table' variable. It seems that when the 'table' should be generated as a DataFrame, it is being output as a Series instead.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the 'table' variable is always a DataFrame before handling it further.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[pd.DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return pd.concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (code for values_passed, to_filter, etc.)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    if isinstance(agged, pd.Series):
        agged = agged.to_frame()  # Ensure agged is a DataFrame

    # ... (rest of the code)

    return agged
```

In the corrected version, within the `pivot_table` function, we introduced a check to convert 'agged' to a DataFrame whenever it is in a Series format before further processing.

This fix should ensure that the 'table' variable is always a DataFrame and avoids the AttributeError caused by attempting to access the 'columns' attribute on a Series.
