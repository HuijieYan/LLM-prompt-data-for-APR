The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file. The error message is an `AttributeError` stating that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'.

The buggy function is failing when trying to access the `nlevels` attribute from a 'Series' object, which is not possible. This is likely happening because the function is returning a 'Series' object instead of a 'DataFrame' object in certain scenarios.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to ensure that it consistently returns a 'DataFrame' object, even in the scenarios where 'Series' objects are created internally.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

from pandas import DataFrame

# The related functions, such as _add_margins and _convert_by, will remain the same

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> 'DataFrame':
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... existing code ...

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = DataFrame(table)  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    # ... existing code ...

    return table
```

In the corrected version, the function ensures that the `table` variable is always a 'DataFrame' object, even if it was originally a 'Series' object. This will prevent any AttributeError from occurring.

With this correction, the function should no longer raise an AttributeError when accessing the `nlevels` attribute, and the bug described in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
