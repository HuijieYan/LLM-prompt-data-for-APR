To fix the bug in the `pivot_table` function, we need to address the issue with multi-index columns only.

The problem lies in the `pivot_table` function's capability to handle multi-index columns. When attempting to pivot the DataFrame with multi-index columns, the function fails to handle the operation and raises an `AttributeError`. This is due to an issue with the code logic during the implementation of handling multi-index column data.

The error arises from a check within the `pivot_table` function that verifies the number of levels in the column index. When working with multi-index columns only, this check fails and produces an AttributeError.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the logic in the `pivot_table` function to appropriately handle the multi-index columns. The function should be updated to accurately determine whether multi-index columns are present and handle them accordingly.

Below is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that addresses the issue:

```python
# Updated and corrected pivot_table function
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (unchanged code for handling list of aggfunc)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        # ... (unchanged code for handling values)

    else:
        # ... (unchanged code for handling values as data columns)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    # Update to handle multi-index column data
    if (
        dropna 
        and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) 
        and len(agged.columns)
        and (isinstance(agged.columns, MultiIndex) and agged.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        # Unstack the multi-index columns
        table = agged.unstack()
    else:
        table = agged

    # Additional handling of dropna
    if not dropna:
        # ... (unchanged code for handling dropna)
    
    # Sort index if the resultant table is a DataFrame
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    # Additional handling for fill_value and margins

    return table
```

The corrected version of the `pivot_table` function addresses the issue with handling multi-index columns. Now, the function correctly checks for the presence of multi-index columns and unstacks them if necessary to ensure symmetrical behavior between rows and columns in single and multi cases.

After implementing this correction, the `pivot_table` function should be able to appropriately handle multi-index columns without raising any errors and provide the expected output.
