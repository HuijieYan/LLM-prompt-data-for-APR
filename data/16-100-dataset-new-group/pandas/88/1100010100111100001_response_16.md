Looking at the buggy function and the corresponding error messages, it is apparent that the issue involves the creation of a table with multiple column levels when calling the `pivot_table` function.

The main problem with the current implementation seems to be the following line:
```python
if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]
```
This snippet of code checks if the `values` parameter was passed as a single value, and if the resulting table has multiple column levels. If so, it selects the first value from the `values` list, which is incorrect.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug is to modify the above-mentioned code block to properly handle cases where the resulting table has multiple column levels. Instead of simply selecting the first value from the `values` list, we should consider returning the entire `table` to keep all the columns present in the output.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code ...

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Existing code ...

    # Existing code ...

    if not dropna:
        # Existing code ...

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # Existing code ...

    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        # Keep the table as is with multiple column levels
        return table

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # GH 15193 Make sure empty columns are removed if dropna=True
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```
By returning the entire `table` when it has multiple column levels, we ensure that all relevant data is retained when constructing pivot tables with multi-level columns, as observed in the failing test cases.
