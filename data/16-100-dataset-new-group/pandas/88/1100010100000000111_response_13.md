The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to pivot with multi-index columns. The issue is described in the GitHub post, where it is expected that the function should work symmetrically between rows/columns and single/multi cases without any errors.

The bug is caused by an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a `Series` object. This occurs when `table` is assigned a `Series` object instead of a `DataFrame` due to a specific condition in the `pivot_table` function.

To fix this bug, we should refactor the `pivot_table` function to handle the case where a `Series` object is returned and handle it appropriately. We also need to ensure that existing conditions and operations in the function are correctly handling both `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# assumption: other code in the pivot.py file remains unchanged

from pandas import DataFrame, Series

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> Union[DataFrame, Series]:  # Return type changed to Union[DataFrame, Series]
    # Existing code...

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)
    elif isinstance(table, Series):  # Handle the case when table is a Series
        table.name = values[0] if values_passed and not values_multi else None
        table = table.unstack().sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table.fillna(fill_value)

    # Existing code...

    return table
```

In the corrected version, we change the return type of the `pivot_table` function to `Union[DataFrame, Series]` to handle the case where `table` can be either a `DataFrame` or a `Series`. We also added a conditional statement to handle the case when `table` is a `Series` by unstacking it and then sorting the index.

By making these changes, the `pivot_table` function should now handle both `DataFrame` and `Series` objects properly, resolving the AttributeError issue when pivoting with multi-index columns.
