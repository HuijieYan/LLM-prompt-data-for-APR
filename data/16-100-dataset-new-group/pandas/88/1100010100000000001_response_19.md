The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The recursive call to pivot_table in the case where aggfunc is a list, which could result in an infinite loop or excessive memory usage.
2. The manipulation and filtering of the 'data' DataFrame within the function, which could result in unexpected behavior or data loss.
3. The handling of MultiIndex and NaN values, which could lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.
4. The conditional block for handling the 'table' DataFrame before returning the result, which may result in unexpected modifications or output.

The cause of the bug could be due to the recursive call to pivot_table when aggfunc is a list. Additionally, the handling of MultiIndex, NaN values, and special cases for returning the 'table' DataFrame may cause unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to avoid the recursive call to pivot_table when aggfunc is a list, as this can lead to an infinite loop or excessive memory usage. Instead, the function should handle multiple aggregation functions directly without recursion.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
# Import statements removed for brevity

# The corrected version of the pivot_table function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            agged = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed).agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original

    keys = index + columns
    # Rest of the function remains the same as the original

    return table
```

In the corrected version, the problem with the recursive call has been addressed by directly iterating over the aggfunc list and applying the aggregation functions to the grouped data. This eliminates the need for recursion and handles multiple aggregation functions appropriately.
