The bug in the `pivot_table` function is due to the fact that it is recursively calling itself with the same input data and parameters, resulting in an infinite loop and causing a stack overflow error. This can be observed from the fact that in the failing tests, multiple calls to `pivot_table` are present within the function, with the same input data and parameters.

The recursive calls to `pivot_table` are happening when `aggfunc` is of type list, and for each function in the list, the `pivot_table` function is called recursively using the same input data and other parameters.

To fix this bug, we need to change the recursive call of `pivot_table` to a call of the `agg` method with the corresponding aggregation function, to aggregate the grouped data without having the overhead of recursive calls.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []

        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)

            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

                for v in values if values is not None else data.columns:
                    if (
                        v in data
                        and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                        and v in agged
                        and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                    ):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

            table = agged
            if table.index.nlevels > 1:
                index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
                to_unstack = []
                for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
                    name = agged.index.names[i]
                    if name is None or name in index_names:
                        to_unstack.append(i)
                    else:
                        to_unstack.append(name)
                table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected version, the recursive call of `pivot_table` has been replaced with a direct usage of the `agg` method of the grouped data to perform the aggregation, thus eliminating the possibility of an infinite loop and addressing the stack overflow error.
