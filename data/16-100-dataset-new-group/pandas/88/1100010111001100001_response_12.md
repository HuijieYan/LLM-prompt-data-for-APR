The issue with the `pivot_table` function is that it calls itself recursively when `aggfunc` is a list, leading to incorrect results for the test cases.

The bug is likely caused by the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the `if isinstance(aggfunc, list)` block. This leads to incorrect aggregation and concatenation of the results, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, we can modify the recursive call to handle each function in `aggfunc` separately and then concatenate the results. We can use a loop to iterate through each function in `aggfunc`, perform the pivot table operation for each function, and then concatenate the results using the `concat` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame
from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
from pandas.core.groupby import Grouper
from pandas import DataFrame, Index, MultiIndex
import pandas._testing as tm

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

                # we want to down cast if
                # the original values are ints
                # as we grouped with a NaN value
                # and then dropped, coercing to floats
                for v in values:
                    if (
                        v in data
                        and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                        and v in agged
                        and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                    ):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
    # ...

```

This corrected version ensures that the recursive call to `pivot_table` is removed, and the aggregation results for each function in `aggfunc` are concatenated correctly.

After implementing this fix, the `pivot_table` function should pass the failing tests provided.
