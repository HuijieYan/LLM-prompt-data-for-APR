The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to handling multi-index columns. The failing test case `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` uses various combinations of columns to pivot the data, and the function is failing to handle these multi-index columns correctly.

The issue is demonstrated by the failing test case and the reported GitHub issue, where using `pivot_table` with `columns=('k1','k2')` results in an `AttributeError`. The expected behavior is to pivot the data for multi-index columns without error.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables inside the function, it appears that the issue is arising from the handling of multi-index columns when discarding the top level. The code is not effectively handling the case when `values_passed` is `True` and `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. 

To fix the bug, the function `pivot_table` should be modified to handle the case of multi-index columns when `values_passed` is `True` and `table.columns.nlevels > 1`.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing code...

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        if values_passed and not values_multi and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            levels_to_keep = table.columns.levels[-1]
            table = table[levels_to_keep]

    # existing code...

    return table
```

This updated code will address the issue with the handling of the multi-index columns, resulting in correct behavior for multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function. After making this change, the function should pass the failing test cases and resolve the reported GitHub issue.
