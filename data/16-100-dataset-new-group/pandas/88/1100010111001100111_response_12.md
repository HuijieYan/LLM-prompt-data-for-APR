The issue seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function when used with multi-index columns. The test code provided shows a scenario where the function is expected to pivot the data correctly but results in an AttributeError when the input format contains multi-index columns.

Based on the runtime values and the test code, it appears that the issue arises when the variable `table` in the function is a series instead of a dataframe. This causes the subsequent code to fail when trying to access `table.columns` for a series object.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to handle the case when `table` is a series due to the nature of the input data. If `table` is a series, the function should be designed to handle this case gracefully without trying to access attributes that are specific to dataframes.

Here's a corrected version of the function that includes a fix for this issue:

```python
# Import statements are omitted for brevity

def pivot_table_multiindex_fix(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (unchanged)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        # ... (unchanged)

    else:
        # ... (unchanged)

    # ... (unchanged)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        for v in values:
            if (
                v in data
                and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                and v in agged
                and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
            ):
                agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # ... (unchanged)

    # Check if the resulting "table" is a series
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        # Handle the case when "table" is a series, by converting it to a one-column dataframe
        table = table.to_frame()

    # Discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not table.empty
        and (isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```
This version includes a check to verify if the resulting "table" is a series and converts it to a one-column dataframe when appropriate. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and enable the function to handle multi-index columns more effectively.
