Looking at the error message, the buggy function `pivot_table` seems to be producing a `Series` instead of a `DataFrame`. This is leading to an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `columns` attribute in the `Series`. The problem seems to occur when `values` is not a list-like object, and this causes undesired behavior in the subsequent operations.

The cause of the bug is that when `values` is not list-like, but a single element, the logic in the function does not handle this properly, leading to the unintended return type of `Series` instead of `DataFrame`. This causes the subsequent code to fail as it assumes a `DataFrame` structure.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when `values` is not a list-like, the function should take the proper action to avoid returning a `Series`.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import MultiIndex

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # ... (other functions remain unchanged)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        if is_list_like(values):
            values_multi = True
            values = list(values)
        else:
            values_multi = False
            values = [values]  # Ensure values is a list of one element

        # ... (other parts remain unchanged)

        values = list(values)[0]  # Select the single element from the list

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected version, we ensured that `values` is always converted to a list with a single element, so it doesn't produce a `Series`. This should address the issue and make the function return a `DataFrame` as expected.

Please note that other parts of the function are not changed, as they are unrelated to the identified bug.
