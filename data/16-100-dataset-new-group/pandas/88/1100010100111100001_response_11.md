Looking at the failing tests and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it appears the issue is related to the handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function. Specifically, the error message indicates that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns', suggesting that the function is returning a Series object instead of a DataFrame when the pivot operation results in a single series.

One potential source of the bug is the unstacking procedure when the index has more than one level, which could lead to the creation of a Series instead of a DataFrame. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function always returns a DataFrame, even in cases where it results in a single series as output. To achieve this, we should check whether the result of the pivot operation has only a single level for both index and columns, and if so, convert it to a DataFrame before returning it.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (same as original function)
        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (same as original function)

    # grouped and agged as before

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Adjust the output to ensure a DataFrame is returned
        table = table.to_frame()

    # ... (same as original function)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # ... (same as original function)

    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        # Adjust the output to ensure a DataFrame is returned
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # ... (same as original function)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    # Ensure the output is always a DataFrame
    if not isinstance(table, DataFrame):
        table = table.to_frame()

    return table
```

This corrected version ensures that the pivot_table function always returns a DataFrame, even when the output would otherwise be a Series. After incorporating these changes, the function should pass the failing tests.
