## Bug Analysis
The `pivot_table` function contains an error that causes it to fail when trying to pivot a DataFrame with a multi-index on the columns.

The error message indicates that a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. This suggests that the `pivot_table` function is returning a Series instead of a DataFrame under the specific conditions of having multi-index columns.

The error is related to the line:
```python
(table.columns.nlevels > 1)
```
which attempts to access the 'nlevels' attribute of `table.columns`. It appears that `table` in this context is a Series and not a DataFrame, hence the error.

The root cause of this bug seems to be related to the handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function, possibly in the logic for calculating the dimensions of the table.

## Bug Fixing Strategy
To fix this bug, the `pivot_table` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of pivoting a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The function should return a DataFrame in all cases, including when multi-index columns are involved.

We need to ensure that the `table` being manipulated is an instance of a DataFrame rather than a Series. Additionally, the logic for calculating the dimensions of the table should be updated to account for the multi-index columns.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (rest of the function)

    # Correct the handling of the multi-index columns case
    table = agged

    # Validate if the table is a Series, then convert it into a DataFrame
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()

    # Apply the logic for calculating the dimensions of the table, considering multi-index columns
    if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        table = table.unstack()

    # ... (rest of the function)

    return table
```

By ensuring that the `table` is always a DataFrame and updating the logic for multi-index columns, the corrected version of the function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
