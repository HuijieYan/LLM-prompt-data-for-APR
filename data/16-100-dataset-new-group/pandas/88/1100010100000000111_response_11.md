**Analysis:**
The bug in the `pivot_table` function causes an `AttributeError` when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns. The issue on GitHub provides sample code and the expected output, indicating that the current behavior is not as per expectations.

**Identified Potential Error Locations:**
1. The if condition that checks for `table.columns.nlevels > 1` is triggering the error.
2. The section where the top level is discarded if `table.columns.nlevels > 1` needs to be handled for multi-index columns.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug is caused by the assumption that `table` is always a DataFrame, which is not the case when dealing with multi-index columns. This assumption leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access `.columns` attribute of a Series object.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Check if `table` is a DataFrame before trying to access its `.columns` attribute.
2. Handle the case of multi-index columns, specifically when trying to discard the top level if it exists.

**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # existing code

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        temp_columns = table.columns.droplevel()
        temp_table = table.reset_index(drop=True)
        temp_table.columns = temp_columns
        table = temp_table

    # existing code

    return table
```
In the corrected version, we first check if `table` is a Series and convert it to a DataFrame if needed. Then, we handle the case of multi-index columns by resetting the index and renaming the columns accordingly, ensuring that the function outputs the expected DataFrame, resolving the bug as described in the GitHub issue.
