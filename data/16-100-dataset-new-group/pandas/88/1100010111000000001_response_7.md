The buggy function `pivot_table` has multiple detected errors, causing it to fail the test case `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only`:
1. The `MultiIndex` is not correctly created for the `index` and `columns` variables.
2. When the `table` generated has multiple index levels, it doesn't correctly discard the top level in all cases.

The cause of the bug is that the `pivot_table` function is not handling `MultiIndex` correctly and is creating an incorrect structure, failing the test case when trying to assert the expected result with the actual result.

To fix the bug, an adjustment is needed to ensure that the `MultiIndex` is correctly created and that the top level is correctly discarded when the pivot table index has multiple levels.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (unchanged)
    
    keys = index + columns

    # ... (unchanged)
    
    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        # gh-21133
        # we want to down cast if
        # the original values are ints
        # as we grouped with a NaN value
        # and then dropped, coercing to floats
        for v in values:
            # ... (unchanged)

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = [
            index_names.index(i) if isinstance(i, str) else i for i in index
        ]
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    if not dropna:
        if table.index.nlevels > 1:
            # ... (unchanged)
        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            # ... (unchanged)

    # ... (unchanged)
    
    return table

```

With this corrected version, the `pivot_table` function should now pass the failing test case.
