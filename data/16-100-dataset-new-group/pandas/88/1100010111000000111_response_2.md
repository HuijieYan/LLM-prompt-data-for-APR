The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns only.

The cause of the bug is that when the function checks for `values_passed` and `values_multi`, it incorrectly assumes that `table` will always be a DataFrame. However, in the case of multi-index columns only, `table` may end up being a Series instead of a DataFrame, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access its `columns`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `table` is always a DataFrame before accessing its columns. We can do this by checking the type of `table` and converting it to a DataFrame if necessary.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (no changes needed here)
    
    keys = index + columns

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame):
        table = agged
    else:
        table = agged.to_frame().T

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # ... (no changes needed here)

    # ... (other processing steps without changes)

    return table
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check the type of `agged`. If it's already a DataFrame (`ABCDataFrame`), we assign it to `table` as is. Otherwise, if it's a Series, we convert it to a DataFrame using `to_frame()` and then transpose it using `T` to ensure that `table` is always a DataFrame. This ensures that we can safely access its columns without causing an AttributeError.

With these changes, the `pivot_table` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue related to the bug.
