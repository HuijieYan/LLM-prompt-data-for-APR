The code is trying to handle multi-index columns, but it has a bug causing it to fail for some specific cases, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute of `DataFrame`. This is an issue identified in a GitHub problem titled "BUG/API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only". The detailed description of the issue cites examples where `pivot_table` fails to handle multi-index columns.

The bug is likely in the part of the code that processes multi-index columns. When the code filters and processes values, the incorrect handling of multi-index columns causes the program to stumble and raise an AttributeError. The bug arises from the incorrect handling of multi-index columns in a particular part of the code.

A possible strategy to fix the bug could involve a refactor of code handling multi-index columns. This fix should potentially include changes to ensure that multi-index columns are handled properly when aggregating, filtering and processing values, and unstacking. By ensuring that all operations are consistent with multi-index columns, the bug causing the AttributeError can be resolved.

Here's the corrected version where multi-index columns are treated correctly:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (rest of the code unchanged)

    # If columns is a multi-index, unstack it
    if columns and isinstance(columns[0], tuple):
        table = agged.unstack(columns)
    elif columns and isinstance(columns, list) and isinstance(columns[0], tuple):
        table = agged.unstack(columns)
    else:
        # Proceed with regular processing when not dealing with multi-index columns
        table = agged

    # ... (rest of the code unchanged)

    return table
```

In this corrected version, the unstacking operation is modified to handle both single-level and multi-level columns properly and consistently. This should resolve the bug causing the AttributeError when using `pivot_table` with multi-index columns.
