The issue seems to be related to the multi-index handling in the `pivot_table` function, particularly when the `columns` parameter consists of a tuple.

Given the information and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue originates from the part of the code that determines whether `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. It could be possible that when `columns` is a tuple, `table.columns` is returning a Series instead of a MultiIndex, leading to the AttributeError.

### Bug Summary
The issue is that the `pivot_table` function throws an AttributeError when trying to access the `nlevels` attribute on `table.columns` during the handling of multi-index columns, because it returns a Series instead of a MultiIndex.

### Bug Fix
To address this issue, we can modify that part of the code to handle both Series and MultiIndex cases for `table.columns`. Also, we need to ensure that column nlevels are considered correctly based on the return type.

### Updated `pivot_table` Function
Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # existing implementation (up to the part where the error was happening)

    # existing implementation that prepares the table

    nlevels = 1
    if isinstance(table.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        nlevels = table.columns.nlevels
    elif isinstance(table.columns, pd.Series):
        # Check if the Series index has multiple levels
        nlevels = table.columns.index.nlevels

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and nlevels > 1:
        table = table[values[0]]    

    return table
```

With this correction, the `nlevels` variable is set appropriately based on the return type of `table.columns`, and the attribute access issue is addressed.

By making this change, the corrected `pivot_table` function should handle the given test cases correctly and avoid the AttributeError.
