The potential error location in the code is within the for loop where the pivot_table is called recursively. This causes an infinite recursion loop leading to a potential stack overflow error.

The bug is caused by the recursive call to pivot_table within the if isinstance(aggfunc, list) block. When aggfunc is a list, the function recursively calls itself with the same arguments, leading to an infinite loop.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition that checks for the length of the aggfunc list. If it's greater than 1, then we can perform the pivot_table operation on each function in the list and concatenate the results together.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list) and len(aggfunc) > 1:
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected version adds a condition to check if the length of the aggfunc list is greater than 1 before entering the if block. If the condition is not satisfied, the function continues to execute the remaining logic as before.
