The bug in the function `pivot_table` is causing errors when using multi-index columns due to a check that results in accessing attributes on a Series when it should be a DataFrame. The runtime values and types of variables show that the `table` variable is sometimes a DataFrame, but it's also being used as though it could be a Series in the error condition. This discrepancy is likely the cause of the AttributeError seen in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the code should be adjusted to ensure that `table` is treated appropriately based on its type. Additionally, the condition around the AttributeError check needs revisiting to accommodate the different data structures.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        # truncating the code for brevity

    else:
        values = data.columns
        for key in keys:
            try:
                values = values.drop(key)
            except (TypeError, ValueError, KeyError):
                pass
        values = list(values)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    # adjusting the code to work appropriately with Series and DataFrame
    if isinstance(agged, ABCSeries):
        table = DataFrame(agged)
    else:
        table = agged

    # truncating the remaining code for brevity

    return table
```

By incorporating conditional checks based on the type of `agged` (i.e., whether it's a Series or a DataFrame), the corrected `pivot_table` function should now handle multi-index columns appropriately and prevent the AttributeError observed in the GitHub issue.
