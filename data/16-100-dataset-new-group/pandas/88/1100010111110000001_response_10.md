The core issue in the buggy function is that when the `result` is being returned, it is mistakenly returning a Series object instead of a DataFrame object.

This issue could be happening due to the fact that within the `pivot_table` function, the intermediate result during the computation is not wrapped or transformed into a DataFrame, which leads to returning a Series object instead.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the intermediate results are consistently transformed into DataFrame objects and properly handled before returning the final result.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas.core.generic import NDFrame
from pandas import concat

def pivot_table(
    data: NDFrame,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    # Replace the return statement with the following code to convert Series to DataFrame
    return table.reset_index() if isinstance(table, ABCSeries) else table
```

By using the `reset_index()` method, we convert the Series object back into a DataFrame, resolving the issue of the return type discrepancy.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and pass the failing test cases.
