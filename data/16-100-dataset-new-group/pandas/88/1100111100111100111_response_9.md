Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, the bug in the `pivot_table` function is related to handling multi-index columns. The failing tests all involve multi-index columns, and the error message points to an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a `Series` object.

The problematic line in the `pivot_table` function is:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```

The error occurs when the `table` variable contains a single level of columns, leading to an AttributeError when trying to access `nlevels`.

To fix this bug, this specific conditional statement needs to be modified to ensure that it safely checks the number of column levels before trying to access them.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # other function code...

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (isinstance(table.columns, MultiIndex) and table.columns.nlevels > 1):
```

In this correction, a check is added to ensure that `table.columns` is an instance of `MultiIndex` before checking the number of levels.

By introducing this additional isinstance check, the corrected `pivot_table` function should work as expected for all cases, including multi-index columns, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
