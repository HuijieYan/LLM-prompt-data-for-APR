When analyzing the function `pivot_table`, it becomes clear that the issue stems from the use of `len(index)` and `len(keys)` to infer the number of levels in the resulting table. This causes a problem, particularly when the number of levels in the index is less than the length of `index`.

The strategy to fix this issue is to update the approach used to determine the levels in the resulting table, which will involve a more robust approach to handling multi-index data. This might require restructuring the logic for unstacking the table based on the number of levels in the index.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Rest of the function remains the same for the purpose of this fix.
        # ...

    keys = index + columns

    # Rest of the function remains the same for the purpose of this fix.
    # ...

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # Corrected logic for handling multi-index data
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    table = agged

    # Updated approach to determining the levels in the resulting table
    if any(isinstance(ind, ABCSeries) and ind.name is not None for ind in data.index):
        level_set = set()
        for x in data.index:
            if x.name not in keys:
                level_set.add(x.name)

        if len(level_set) > 0:
            if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
                table = table.unstack(list(level_set))
        
    # Rest of the function remains the same for the purpose of this fix.
    # ...

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    # Rest of the function remains the same for the purpose of this fix.
    # ...

    return table
```

This corrected version should resolve the issue with handling multi-index data and ensure that the resulting table contains the expected levels and structure. After applying this correction, the failing test should pass successfully.
