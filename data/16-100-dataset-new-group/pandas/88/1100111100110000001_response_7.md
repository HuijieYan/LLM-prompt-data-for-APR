The issue appears to be due to the fact that the `table` object is sometimes being treated as a Series rather than a DataFrame, causing an AttributeError when attempting to access the `columns` attribute.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the data structure being used is consistent throughout the function. We can do this by checking the type of `table` before accessing the `columns` attribute and ensuring that `table` is always of type DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# import statements...

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (rest of the function body)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    # Check if agged is a DataFrame, if so, dropna from it
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    # ... (rest of the function body)

    if not isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame):
        raise ValueError("Aggregated data must be of type DataFrame")

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return table
```

In the corrected version:
- We added a check to ensure that the `agged` object is always treated as a DataFrame before attempting to access its methods or attributes. If `agged` is not a DataFrame, a ValueError is raised.
- We removed some branches that were checking for DataFrame and Series, and always ensure that the variable `table` is always a DataFrame when it is being accessed.
- We have removed some irrelevant function from the imports.
