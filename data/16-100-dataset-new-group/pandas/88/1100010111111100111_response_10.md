The issue seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function failing when using multi-index columns. Specifically, when the `df2.pivot_table(values='v', columns=('k1','k2'))` is called, it throws an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`.

### Problem Identification
The issue seems to stem from the portion of the code where it is checking the levels of table columns: 
```python
# discard the top level
if (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
```
From the test cases and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the code is not properly handling multi-index columns.

### Suggested Bug Fix Strategy
The first step would be to identify a way to check for multi-index columns in a DataFrame and ensure the subsequent logic within the function is appropriate to handle such cases. Additionally, the behavior of the function with multi-index columns should be aligned with the expected functionality described in the GitHub issue.

The bug fix strategy can involve examining the conditional logic related to columns and providing distinct handling for single-index and multi-index cases. This could potentially involve adjustments in the conditional checks and the subsequent operations based on the structure of the columns.

### Bug Fix
Here's a corrected version of the buggy function's code:

```python
# This is the corrected `pivot_table` function
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # The existing logic for handling list of aggfunc remains unchanged

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        # The logic to check values list, and its handling is adjusted to accommodate multi-index columns

    # The original grouping and aggregation logic remains mostly unchanged
    # ...

    # Modification to handle multi-index columns and dropna=True scenario
    if dropna:
        if table.index.nlevels > 1:
            m = MultiIndex.from_tuples(cartesian_product(table.index.levels, names=table.index.names))
            table = table.reindex(m, axis=0)

        if table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            m = MultiIndex.from_tuples(cartesian_product(table.columns.levels, names=table.columns.names))
            table = table.reindex(m, axis=1)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer")

    if margins:
        # Existing logic for adding margins
        # ...

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

The main modification here is the addition of specific handling for multi-index columns when checking levels and reindexing to handle the `dropna=True` case. Additionally, the operations for handling multi-index columns are adjusted to ensure the function operates correctly in this scenario.

After applying these modifications, the corrected function should now handle the case of multi-index columns appropriately. It should also align with the expected functionality described in the GitHub issue.
