Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The section for discarding the top level seems to be a potential area where the bug might be occurring as indicated in the GitHub issue.
2. Another potential area could be the handling of multi-index columns.

Explanation of the cause of the bug:
The bug seems to occur when using `pivot_table` with multi-index columns only. This causes an AttributeError due to an attempt to access the 'columns' attribute on a 'Series' object.

Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the case of multi-index columns and does not cause an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'columns' attribute.

Corrected version of the function:
```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame)  # Check if the table is an instance of ABCDataFrame
        and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return table
```
In the corrected version, a check has been added to ensure that the 'table' is an instance of ABCDataFrame before attempting to access the 'columns' attribute. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring when using `pivot_table` with multi-index columns only.
