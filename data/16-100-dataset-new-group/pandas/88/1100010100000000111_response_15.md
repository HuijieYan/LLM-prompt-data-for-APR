Analysis:
- The provided function is `pivot_table` which is used to pivot a DataFrame.
- The GitHub issue reports an AttributeError when using the `pivot_table` function with multi-index columns, leading to an error message stating that 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'.

Error Locations:
1. The AttributeError occurs at line 174, where the code checks if `table.columns.nlevels > 1`.

Cause of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `table` object is being treated as a DataFrame, but in the case of a Series, it does not have a `columns` attribute, which results in the AttributeError.

Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case when `table` is a Series. This can be achieved by checking the type of `table` and taking appropriate action depending on whether it is a DataFrame or a Series.

Corrected Version:
```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (imports and other code)

    # existing code ...

    # Check the type of 'table' and handle accordingly
    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):  # Check if 'table' is a Series
        if not table.empty:
            table = table.to_frame()  # Convert Series to DataFrame

    # existing code ...

    return table
```
In the corrected version, we added a conditional check to determine if `table` is a Series, and if it is, we convert it to a DataFrame using the `to_frame()` method. This ensures that the code does not try to access the `columns` attribute on a Series, preventing the AttributeError.
