The buggy function `pivot_table` appears to be recursively calling itself when the `aggfunc` parameter is a list. A potential cause for the bug could be the use of `pivot_table` function within the `if isinstance(aggfunc, list):` block, which can lead to infinite recursion under certain conditions.

The buggy function is in the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file. The error occurs when the `pivot_table` function is called with the `aggfunc` parameter as a list, such as `aggfunc=["mean", "sum"]`, leading to infinite recursion and resulting in a stack overflow.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic related to handling `aggfunc` as a list, as this approach can result in an infinite loop.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        aggs = {}
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
            aggs[getattr(func, "__name__", func)] = agged

        table = concat(aggs, axis=1)
    else:
        # rest of the function remains the same
        ...
        ...
        # (remaining code)

    return table
```

This corrected version directly handles the `aggfunc` list by iterating through each function, aggregating the data, and then concatenating the results into a single DataFrame.

This corrected version should fix the infinite recursion bug and allow the `aggfunc` list to be properly handled without leading to a stack overflow.
