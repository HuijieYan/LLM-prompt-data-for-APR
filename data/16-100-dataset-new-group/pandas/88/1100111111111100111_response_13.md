The issue with the `pivot_table` function is that the logic for handling multi-index columns is causing an AttributeError when `df2.pivot_table(values='v', columns=('k1','k2'))` is called. The specific error message is `'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`.

The problem arises from the logic that tries to handle multi-index columns. In this logic, the code checks if `table.columns.nlevels > 1` to determine whether to select the top level of the DataFrame. However, when columns are given as a multi-index, the intermediate results are Series objects rather than DataFrames. This leads to the AttributeError when attempting to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object.

A strategy to fix this bug is to modify the logic that deals with multi-index columns to handle multi-index Series correctly. This can be done by checking whether the result is a DataFrame or a Series and adjust the code accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that handles multi-index columns correctly:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # (Same function body...)

    keys = index + columns

    # (Rest of the function body...)

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Correct the handling of multi-index columns
        if isinstance(table, DataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            # If the table is a DataFrame and has multi-index columns
            # select only the top level
            table = table[values[0]] if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty else table
        elif isinstance(table, Series) and table.index.nlevels > 1:
            # If the table is a Series and has multi-index index
            # reset_index to convert it to a DataFrame
            table = table.reset_index()

    # (Rest of the function body...)

    return table
```

With this corrected version of the `pivot_table` function, the issue related to multi-index columns causing an AttributeError should be resolved, and the function should correctly handle different types of columns, including single index and multi-index columns.
