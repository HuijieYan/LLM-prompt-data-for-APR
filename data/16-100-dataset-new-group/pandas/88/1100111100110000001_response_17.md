The buggy function causes an 'AttributeError' because it tries to access the 'columns' attribute of a 'Series' object, which does not exist.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function incorrectly assumes that it is working with a DataFrame, but if 'len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0', then it is actually working with a Series. This leads to an attempt to access the 'columns' attribute, which results in the 'AttributeError' since Series objects do not have a 'columns' attribute.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where a Series is being processed separately. The 'table' object should be checked if it is an instance of Series or DataFrame, and appropriate code should be executed based on the type of object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # Remaining code is the same

    keys = index + columns

    values_passed = values is not None
    if values_passed:
        # Remaining code is the same
    else:
        # Remaining code is the same

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        # Remaining code is the same

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        if dropna:
            data = data[data.notna().all(axis=1)]
        if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
            table = _add_margins(
                table,
                data,
                values,
                rows=index,
                cols=columns,
                aggfunc=aggfunc,
                observed=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                fill_value=fill_value,
            )
        else:  # handle the case when 'table' is a Series
            table = _add_margins(
                table,
                data,
                values,
                rows=None,
                cols=None,
                aggfunc=aggfunc,
                observed=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                fill_value=fill_value,
            )

    # Remaining code is the same

    return table
```

In the corrected version, the conditional branching is added to handle the case when 'table' is a Series object. If 'table' is a Series, appropriate arguments are passed to the '_add_margins' function, and the bug causing the AttributeError is resolved.
