The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` to be raised. This error occurs when the code tries to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object, which does not have this attribute.

The bug appears to be in the portion of the code that handles the manipulation of the `table` variable, which is a DataFrame or Series at various points in the function. The `table` variable is used to store the result of operations before being returned at the end of the function.

The bug may be related to the logic that checks whether the `table` contains multiple columns, such as in this condition: `table.columns.nlevels > 1`. If `table` is a Series instead of a DataFrame, it does not have a `columns` attribute, which leads to the AttributeError.

A potential strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that the `table` variable is consistently formatted as a DataFrame, even if it contains only one column. This could involve converting a Series to a DataFrame in cases where the code expects `table` to have DataFrame-like attributes.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that includes a modification to handle a Series as the `table` variable:

```python
from pandas.core.generic import NDFrame

# ... (Imports and decorator code)

def pivot_table(
    # ... (other parameters)
) -> 'DataFrame':
    # (function body)

    # <... existing code ...>

    # Ensure table is a DataFrame even if it has only 1 column
    if isinstance(table, NDFrame) and not isinstance(table, DataFrame):
        table = table.to_frame()

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

In this corrected version, we check if the `table` is an instance of `NDFrame` (the parent class of both Series and DataFrame), but not an instance of DataFrame. If this condition is met, it converts the `table` to a DataFrame using the `to_frame` method.

This modification should address the bug by ensuring that the `table` variable is consistently treated as a DataFrame and can be expected to have DataFrame-like attributes.

After making this change, retest the failing test cases to ensure that the bug has been fixed.
