## Identify potential error locations within the buggy function:

1. The line `if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):` is causing an AttributeError when trying to access `table.columns` as a Series object doesn't have a `columns` attribute.

## Explain the cause of the bug:
The bug occurs when `table` is a Series instead of a DataFrame, and the buggy function tries to access the `columns` attribute of a Series, causing an AttributeError.

## Suggest a strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should handle the case where `table` is a Series and not a DataFrame, ensuring that the appropriate attribute or method is used based on the type of the object.

## Fix the bug:

```python
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc="mean", fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name="All", observed=False) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # existing code...

    table = agged

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)
    elif isinstance(table, ABCSeries):  # Add this elif block to handle Series
        table = table.sort_index()

    # existing code...

    return table
```
