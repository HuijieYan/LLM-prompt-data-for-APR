The bug in the `pivot_table` function appears to be related to creating a new DataFrame from the columns parameter. The function is ultimately trying to unstack the resulting DataFrame, but it ends up attempting to unstack a Series object, causing AttributeError. To fix this bug, we need to identify the specific part of the function where this issue arises.

Looking at the test data, it is clear that the function is trying to pivot a DataFrame using different column values, which results in an error. The issue seems to occur when there are multiple columns specified in the "cols" parameter. The error message indicates that the "Series" object has no attribute 'columns', indicating that there might be an issue with how the function is trying to handle the column input.

To correct this bug, a strategy is to use the `pivot` method instead of recreating the pivot functionality within the `pivot_table` function. By using the built-in method, we can avoid issues related to unstacking a Series object. Additionally, it's important to address the specific issue that arises when multiple columns are specified in the "cols" parameter.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    if isinstance(columns, tuple):
        result = data.pivot(index=index, columns=columns, values=values)
    elif isinstance(columns, list):
        result = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=columns, aggfunc=aggfunc)
    else:
        result = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=columns, aggfunc=aggfunc)

    if fill_value is not None:
        result = result.fillna(fill_value)

    if margins:
        # Add margins if needed
        result = result.append(result.agg(['mean', 'sum']))

    return result
```

This updated version of the `pivot_table` function uses the built-in `pivot` and `pivot_table` methods to handle the input data, avoiding the need to recreate the pivoting functionality within the function. It also addresses the potential issue when multiple columns are specified.

By making these changes, the function should now correctly handle the pivot operation for various input configurations, and it should pass the failing test cases.
