To fix the bug, we need to address the AttributeError raised when trying to access the `columns` attribute of a `Series` object in the pivot_table function. 

The cause of the bug is that if the `values` parameter is not None and the `columns` parameter is a multi-index, the function tries to access the `columns.nlevels` attribute on a Series object, which is not supported, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we should first check that the result of calling `pivot_table` is a DataFrame before trying to determine whether the `columns.nlevels` is greater than 1.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        # If the result is a DataFrame and the columns have more than one level
        table = table[values[0]]

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return table
```

With the above change, the corrected function should not raise an AttributeError when working with a multi-index in the columns and should resolve the issue posted on GitHub.

Hope this helps!
