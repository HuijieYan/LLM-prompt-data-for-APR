The bug seems to be related to how the `index` and `columns` parameters are handled, as well as how the MultiIndex for the columns is created in the resulting DataFrame.

After analyzing the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of variables, the issue seems to be with how the `columns` parameter is being used to create the MultiIndex for the columns in the resulting DataFrame.

It appears that the code is constructing the MultiIndex incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. Additionally, the unstacking process is causing the columns to be transposed incorrectly.

To fix the bug, we should modify the section of the code that handles the creation of the MultiIndex for the columns and ensure that the unstacking process is performed correctly to avoid transposing the columns incorrectly.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# import statements...

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # modify columns to ensure it's a list
    columns = _convert_by(columns)
    if columns is None:
        columns = []

    # rest of the code...

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Correct the unstacking process
        level_names = [idx if isinstance(idx, str) else data.columns[idx] for idx in table.index.names]
        to_unstack = [level_names.index(col) for col in columns]
        table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # rest of the code...

    return table
```

In this corrected version:
- We ensure that the `columns` variable is converted to a list, which will simplify its usage in creating the MultiIndex.
- We also correct the unstacking process to use the named levels in the index for better handling of MultiIndex columns.

By making these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test cases.
