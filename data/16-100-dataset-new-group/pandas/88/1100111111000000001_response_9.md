The buggy function is a poorly implemented pivot_table function which calls itself recursively, ultimately creating an infinite loop. When the 'aggfunc' parameter is passed as a list, the function enters a loop to call pivot_table again, generating an infinite loop.

To fix this, we need to avoid the recursive call in this scenario. One possible strategy to fix the bug is to introduce a special case handling when 'aggfunc' is a list, treating it differently from the case when it is a single function. This will prevent the function from calling itself infinitely.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            agged = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed).agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # ... (the rest of the original function remains unchanged)

    return table
```

In the corrected version, the recursive call inside the loop for aggfunc list has been replaced with grouping and aggregation directly within the loop, and the results are concatenated to form the final table. This approach prevents the infinite loop and solves the problem.
