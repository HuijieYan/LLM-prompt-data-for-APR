The bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing an AttributeError due to the attempt to access `table.columns` when it's inferred that the `table` is a Series object, which doesn't have a `columns` attribute. This is happening when multi-index columns are passed to the `pivot_table` function.

The bug occurs in the conditional statement:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```

This conditional check is attempting to access `table.columns` when `table` is a Series instead of a DataFrame, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, you can modify the conditional statement to check if `table` is a DataFrame before accessing `table.columns`. If it's a Series, you can directly assign the sliced Series to `table`.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty:
        if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]
        else:
            table = table

    # (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return table
```

With this correction, the code will check if `table` is a DataFrame before accessing `table.columns.nlevels`. If it's a DataFrame, the condition will proceed as before. Otherwise, if it's a Series, it will directly assign the sliced Series to `table`.

This fix should address the AttributeError issue and handle multi-index columns more effectively.
