It seems that the bug in the `pivot_table` function is causing the ValueError. The issue appears to be with the code that handles the automatic unstacking of the index. When index names are integers, there is a problem with checking whether the integers refer to the level position or name.

One potential fix for this issue is to modify the section of the code related to unstacking the table index to handle the case when index names are integers. This could involve explicitly checking the type of the index names and applying the unstacking operation accordingly. 

Here is a corrected version of the function that addresses the issue:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if isinstance(name, int):  # Check if the name is an integer
                to_unstack.append(name)  # Use the integer as the position
            else:
                to_unstack.append(i)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)
    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)

    return table
```

With this corrected version, the function should handle multi-index cases with integer names correctly, and the failing test cases should pass.
