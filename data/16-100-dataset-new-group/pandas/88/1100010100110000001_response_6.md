## Analysis
The error message shows that the `Series` object has no attribute 'columns'. This error arises because the function is attempting to use the 'columns' attribute on a `Series` object when it's only supported for `DataFrame` objects.

The error is triggered by the `table.columns` call inside the `pivot_table` function and is caused by one or multiple input parameters leading to the creation of a Series instead of a DataFrame.

## Bug
The bug is caused when the output of the pivot_table function is inferred wrongly. The function should only return a DataFrame if and only if it's a multi-level DataFrame, but in this case, a Series is returned, leading to the 'columns' attribute error.

## Fix
To fix the bug, we need to add a check at the end of the function to detect if the resulting object is a Series rather than a DataFrame, and if so, perform some additional processing to ensure the return object is a DataFrame.

Also, if a DataFrame is expected, it can be explicitly converted to DataFrame to ensure the function always returns a DataFrame.

## Solution
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # other code remains the same

    # Previous code...

    # Fix the bug by ensuring the resulting object is always a DataFrame
    table = table if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) else DataFrame(table)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```
In this solution, we added a check to make sure that `table` is forced to be a DataFrame, irrespective of its type, before proceeding with other operations. This guarantees that the function indeed always returns a DataFrame object.
