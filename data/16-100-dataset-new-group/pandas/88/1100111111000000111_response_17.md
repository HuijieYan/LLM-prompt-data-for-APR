The bug in the `pivot_table` function causes an AttributeError when using multi-index columns. It fails with a 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns' error. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "BUG/API: pivot_table with multi-index columns only" and provides a copy-pastable example and the expected output. 

The cause of the bug lies within the code of the `pivot_table` function. There is a conditional check for `table.columns.nlevels > 1`, which attempts to access the `columns` attribute of the `table` variable, assuming it is a DataFrame. However, in the failing case, `table` is inferred to be a Series, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the conditional check needs to be modified to handle both DataFrame and Series types appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:
```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (existing code)

    # Check for series
    if not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = DataFrame(table)

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = table.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = table.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = table.unstack(to_unstack)

    # ... (remaining code)
    
    return table
```

By explicitly converting the `table` to a DataFrame if it is not one, the function will handle both DataFrame and Series types uniformly and avoid the AttributeError. This corrected version of the function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test.
