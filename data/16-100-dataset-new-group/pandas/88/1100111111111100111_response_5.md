The issue with the current implementation of the `pivot_table` function is that it fails when used with multi-index columns. This leads to an `AttributeError` related to accessing columns on a `Series` object.

The generated code for testing the buggy function suggests that the failure is due to an attempt to access `.nlevels` attribute on the `table.columns` object when `table` might be a `Series`. This attribute is only available for DataFrames and MultiIndexes, but with the current logic, it's not appropriately handling the transition from `DataFrame` to `Series`.

The bug is likely occurring in this part of the code:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```

To fix the bug, the code could be modified to check if `table` is a `Series` before attempting to access the `.columns` attribute. If `table` is indeed a `Series`, the existing logic should be bypassed and the function should return the `Series` directly. Otherwise, the current logic can proceed for `DataFrame`-like objects. 

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    # ... remaining parameters ...
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... previous code ...

    if not isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
            table = table[values[0]]
    return table
```

The corrected version makes sure that the `table` remains a `Series` if it is indeed a `Series`, avoiding the attempt to access `.columns`. This fix should address the issue observed when using `pivot_table` with multi-index columns.

By making this modification, the `pivot_table` function should work properly for multi-index columns and avoid the `AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'` that was reported in the GitHub issue.
