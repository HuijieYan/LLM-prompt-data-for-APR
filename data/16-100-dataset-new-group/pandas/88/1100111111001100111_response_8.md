The issue in the `pivot_table` function is that when `columns` is a multi-index, the function fails to correctly handle the case. Specifically, in the `if` condition at line 174, it checks for `not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1)`. When `columns` is a multi-index, `values_multi` is incorrect, leading to the failure. The function needs to treat the multi-index columns in a way that allows for the reading of `values_multi` while maintaining the behavior for single-index columns.

Given the analysis, to fix this bug, the handling of `values_multi` needs to be modified for cases where `columns` is a multi-index.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function that should resolve the bug based on the analysis:

```python
# Corrected `pivot_table` function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code)

    # Check if columns is a multi-index
    if isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)) and all(isinstance(col, tuple) for col in columns):
        values_multi = True
    else:
        values_multi = False

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

In this correction, the code checks if `columns` is a list or tuple and if all elements are of type tuple. If they are, it sets `values_multi` to `True`, indicating multi-index columns, and the behavior of the function can be adapted as needed. Otherwise, it sets `values_multi` to `False`, continuing with the existing behavior for single-index columns.

The changes in the corrected version enable the function to differentiate and handle single-index and multi-index columns correctly, addressing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
