To fix the bug in the `pivot_table` function, we need to address the issue where the returned DataFrame is being converted into a Series with the error message "AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'". This issue is caused by the logic that attempts to discard the top level when `values_passed` and `values_multi` are both False and the table is not empty and has multiple columns. This logic is bypassed incorrectly due to the flawed condition.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    # Following the existing logic of the function, add a proper condition to discard the top level
    if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and table.columns.nlevels > 1:
        # Reset the index to accommodate multi-index columns
        table = table.reset_index(drop=True)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain the same)

    return table
```

With this correction, the issue of the DataFrame being incorrectly converted into a Series will be resolved, and the `pivot_table` function will no longer exhibit the AttributeError. After applying this fix, the failing test case should pass without any errors, and the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.
