The bug in the provided function `pivot_table` is that it is calling itself recursively within the for loop when `aggfunc` is a list, leading to infinite recursion and potentially causing a stack overflow. The function should be modified to handle the case where `aggfunc` is a list without calling itself recursively.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `aggfunc` is a list and handle the aggregation for each function separately without calling itself recursively. The result of each aggregation should then be concatenated into a single DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py

# other imports...
from pandas.core.reshape.util import cartesian_product
from pandas import DataFrame

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []

        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)

            if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
                agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

                for v in values:
                    if (
                        v in data
                        and is_integer_dtype(data[v])
                        and v in agged
                        and not is_integer_dtype(agged[v])
                    ):
                        agged[v] = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(agged[v], data[v].dtype)

            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        table = concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    else:
        # Handle other cases as before...
        # ...

    return table
```

In the corrected version, when `aggfunc` is a list, each function in the list is applied to the grouped data separately, and the results are concatenated into a single DataFrame. This prevents the function from calling itself recursively and resolves the bug.
