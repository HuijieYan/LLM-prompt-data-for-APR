The error in the `pivot_table` function is that it is trying to access the `columns` attribute on a Series object. This is causing the `AttributeError`. The error is occurring because the function creates a `table` variable assuming it is always a DataFrame, but in some cases, it might end up with a Series instead.

To fix the bug, you would need to check the type of `table` and convert it to a DataFrame if it is a Series before accessing the `columns` attribute. 

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, Series

...

def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    ...
    
    if isinstance(table, Series):  # Check if table is a Series
        table = table.to_frame()  # Convert it to DataFrame if it's a Series

    if (isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) or isinstance(table, DataFrame)) and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        # Access columns attribute only if table is a DataFrame
        ...
    
    ...
```

With this fix, the `pivot_table` function should now handle both DataFrame and Series outputs correctly, and the failing tests should now pass.
