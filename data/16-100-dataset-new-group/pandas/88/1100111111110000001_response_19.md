The buggy function `pivot_table` is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a Series object. This error is occurring in the related modules `pandas/core/frame.py` and `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py`. The failing test `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` is calling the `pivot_table` function with different values for the `cols` parameter.

The cause of the bug is the recursive call to `pivot_table` within the function itself. The recursive call is made when `aggfunc` is a list, leading to issues with the table's structure, which causes attribute errors when trying to access the 'columns' attribute later in the function.

To fix the bug, I would suggest refactoring the function to avoid these recursive calls and handle the aggregate functions in a different manner, ensuring that the table's structure remains consistent.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(index + columns, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, the function handles the cases when `aggfunc` is a list without making a recursive call to itself. This should address the AttributeError issue caused by the recursive calls and ensure that the function can handle the aggregate functions correctly.
