## Issue analysis
The issue appears to be related to the `pivot_table` function when applied to a DataFrame with multi-index columns. There seems to be an `AttributeError` due to the `object` (Series) not having the attribute `columns`.

The issue is likely occurring in this section of the function:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and \
   (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
    table = table[values[0]]
```

## Bug location
The bug seems to be due to the incorrect usage of `table.columns` with `nlevels` in a multi-index scenario.

## Bug cause
The bug is causing the `AttributeError` as mentioned in the GitHub issue. This is likely because the `table.columns` is a MultiIndex object and does not have the attribute `nlevels` as expected.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
1. Check for the MultiIndex condition before using the `nlevels` attribute on the columns.
2. Use a different approach to select values if the columns are a MultiIndex.
3. Make the necessary changes to handle MultiIndex columns appropriately.

## Corrected code
Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    if isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and not agged.columns.empty:
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")
        
        if not agged.empty:
            if isinstance(agged.columns, MultiIndex) and agged.columns.nlevels > 1:
                table = agged.xs(values, axis=1, level=-1)
            else:
                table = agged[values]

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    return table
```

In the corrected code, the problematic section has been revised to take into account the MultiIndex condition and extract the values accordingly. This change should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
