The error occurs due to the function returning a Series object instead of a DataFrame. This is happening due to the aggregation function returning a Series with a single level of columns, causing the error when checking for more than 1 nlevels of columns.
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `pivot_table` function to handle the situation when an aggregation function returns a Series. In such cases, we need to convert the Series to a DataFrame with a single level column index.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas import Series

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Existing code remains unchanged ...

    # ...

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    
    if isinstance(agged, ABCSeries):  # Check if the result is a Series
        agged = agged.rename(columns={agged.name: 0})  # Rename the Series to have a single level column index
        agged.columns.name = None  # Remove the name of the columns
        agged = agged.to_frame().T  # Convert Series to DataFrame
        
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

    # ... Existing code remains unchanged ...

```
With this modification, the function will now correctly handle the situation when the aggregation function returns a Series, converting it to a DataFrame with a single level column index, thereby ensuring that the subsequent checks and operations can be performed without issues.
