### Bug Explanation

The problem seems to be occurring because of the handling of multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function. The error occurs specifically when `table.columns.nlevels` is checked for these cases, causing an AttributeError.


### Bug Fix Strategy

In order to fix this issue, it seems that the error is related to the handling of columns with multiple levels. It might be useful to directly check the type of `table.columns` to see if it is a `MultiIndex`. This would allow for a conditional check, ensuring that the check for `nlevels` only happens when the columns are actually a multi-index.


### Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Import necessary modules
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas import Index, MultiIndex

# Fix the buggy function
def pivot_table(data, values=None, index=None, columns=None, aggfunc='mean', fill_value=None, margins=False, dropna=True, margins_name='All', observed=False) -> 'DataFrame':
    # Assuming the rest of the code within the function remains correct
    # ...

    # Check if the columns are a MultiIndex before checking nlevels
    if isinstance(table.columns, MultiIndex) and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
        table = table[values[0]]

    # Assuming the rest of the code within the function remains correct
    # ...

    return table
```

This corrected version of the function should address the AttributeError by properly checking for `MultiIndex` before attempting to check `nlevels`. This approach should resolve the issue with multi-index columns in the `pivot_table` function, ensuring a proper symmetrical processing for both single and multi-case scenarios.
