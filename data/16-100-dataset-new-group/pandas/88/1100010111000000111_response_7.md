The buggy function in the `pivot_table` method has an issue when handling multi-index columns, causing it to throw an error due to the series object not having the `columns` attribute.

The cause of the bug is that when the function tries to access the `columns` attribute on the `table` variable, it assumes `table` is a DataFrame, but if the `pivot_table` function only returns a single column (Series), then it does not have a `columns` attribute, resulting in the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to check the type of the `table` variable and handle the Series case separately from the DataFrame case.

Below is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
from pandas import Index, MultiIndex, DataFrame
import pandas._testing as tm

def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # Previous code remains unchanged
    
    # existing code

    if not dropna and isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.empty:
        pass
    else:
        if (
            values_passed
            and not values_multi
            and not table.empty
            and (isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1)
            or (isinstance(table, ABCSeries) and table.name is not None)
        ):
            return table

        if len(index) == 0 and not isinstance(table, ABCSeries) and len(columns) > 0:
            table = table.T
        
        # remaining code...
    
    # existing code
```

In the corrected version, we handle the `table` variable differently based on whether it is a DataFrame or a Series, and we also handle the case where the `table` is empty.

This should resolve the bug and make the `pivot_table` function work correctly, passing the failing test and resolving the GitHub issue.
