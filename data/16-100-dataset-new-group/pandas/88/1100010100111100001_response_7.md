The bug in the `pivot_table` function returns different error outputs depending on the input values, but common patterns are evident. In each case, the error is due to the function attempting to access the `columns` attribute of a Series object, which does not exist, leading to the AttributeError.

The issue arises from inappropriate handling of the `columns` variable within the function, which is a list of column names. When it is used in the condition `table.columns.nlevels > 1`, `table.columns` does not represent the DataFrame columns as intended. Instead, it takes the values of the multi-index columns where `nlevels` is not defined. As a result, when `nlevels` is accessed, it raises an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the approach is to ensure that `table.columns` refers to the columns of the DataFrame `table` rather than the multi-index. This can be achieved by checking whether `table` is a DataFrame or not, and then accessing the `columns` attribute accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (unchanged)

    keys = index + columns

    # ... (unchanged)

    # ... (unchanged)

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)
    if dropna and isinstance(agged, ABCDataFrame) and len(agged.columns):
        agged = agged.dropna(how="all")

        # ... (unchanged)

    table = agged
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    if fill_value is not None:
        table = table._ensure_type(table.fillna(fill_value, downcast="infer"))

    if margins:
        # ... (unchanged)

    # discard the top level
    if (
        values_passed
        and not values_multi
        and not table.empty
        and (isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and table.columns.nlevels > 1)
    ):
        table = table[values[0]]

    if len(index) == 0 and len(columns) > 0:
        table = table.T

    # GH 15193 Make sure empty columns are removed if dropna=True
    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame) and dropna:
        table = table.dropna(how="all", axis=1)

    return table
```

This corrected version includes a check for `isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame)` before accessing the `columns` attribute, ensuring that the attribute is accessed only when `table` is a DataFrame. This should resolve the AttributeError resulting from the buggy function, allowing it to pass the failing tests.
