The bug seems to be related to the `pivot_table` function when handling multi-index columns. It is expected that the function would not raise an `AttributeError` and should return the correct output for multi-index columns, just like it does for single index columns.

After analyzing the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug occurs when calling `df.pivot_table(values='v', columns=('k1','k2'))`. The failure points to the following specific line in the buggy function:
```python
if values_passed and not values_multi and not table.empty and (table.columns.nlevels > 1):
     table = table[values[0]]
```

This line of code assumes that if the `values` list parameter is not multi-index, the `table` return value would be a dataframe and not a series, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to access the `columns` attribute.

To fix this bug, we can introduce handling for multi-index cases that ensure the correct behavior in the `pivot_table` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # ... (previous code remains unchanged)
        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1 or (table.columns.nlevels > 1 and not isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame)):
        if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
            table = DataFrame(table, columns=[index, columns]).T.unstack()
        elif isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
            table = table.unstack()

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if isinstance(table, ABCDataFrame):
        table = table.sort_index(axis=1)

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    return table
```

This change includes explicit handling for multi-index cases, ensuring that the behavior is consistent and the code avoids raising an `AttributeError` when accessing the `table` object. These modifications should resolve the bug as well as the reported GitHub issue.
