The buggy function `pivot_table` is meant to create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. The issue occurs when trying to pivot a DataFrame with multi-index columns only, resulting in an AttributeError due to trying to access the `columns` attribute of a `Series` object.

The bug occurs when the `columns.nlevels` attribute is accessed on the `table` object, which is a Series and does not have the `nlevels` attribute. This is causing the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `table` object is properly created as a DataFrame in all cases, including when multi-index columns are involved.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    if isinstance(table, ABCSeries):
        table = table.to_frame()

    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
        to_unstack = []
        for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
            name = agged.index.names[i]
            if name is None or name in index_names:
                to_unstack.append(i)
            else:
                to_unstack.append(name)
        table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # The remaining code to handle dropna, sorting, fill_value, margins, and adjustments for values and columns is the same

    return table

```

The changes made include adding a check to convert `table` to a DataFrame if it is a Series, before further operations on it. This ensures that the `nlevels` attribute can be accessed without causing an AttributeError.

With this correction, the `pivot_table` function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
