Looking at the runtime input/output values, the errors are occurring when checking for the nlevels attribute of table.columns. The error message points to the fact that it is trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a 'Series' object, which does not exist.

The cause of the bug seems to be that when the aggfunc input is a list, the function keeps calling itself recursively with the original data, without properly handling the intermediate results. As a result, when it reaches the part where it checks the nlevels attribute, it encounters a Series object instead of a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case of multiple aggregation functions properly within the pivot_table function. We can use the result of the internal aggregation for the returned results. Additionally, we need to ensure that the output maintains the expected format, whether it's a Series or DataFrame.

Here's the corrected version of the pivot_table function:

```python
from pandas import Series

# ... (other imports)

@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            table = pivot_table(
                data,
                values=values,
                index=index,
                columns=columns,
                fill_value=fill_value,
                aggfunc=func,
                margins=margins,
                dropna=dropna,
                margins_name=margins_name,
                observed=observed,
            )
            pieces.append(table)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        # Return the result based on whether the pieces list contains more than one element
        if len(pieces) > 1:
            return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)
        else:
            result = pieces[0]
            if isinstance(result, Series):
                result = result.unstack()
            return result

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the correction, we introduced a condition to check whether the resulting pieces list contains more than one element, indicating multiple aggregation functions. If so, we use the concat function to combine the results. Otherwise, we take the first entry from the pieces list and, if it's a Series, we unstack it to convert it to a DataFrame before returning it.

This correction should effectively address the bug and resolve the issue reported in GitHub.
