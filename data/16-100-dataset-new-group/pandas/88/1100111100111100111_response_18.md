The bug in the `pivot_table` function is likely caused by the `table` variable being inferred as a Series in some scenarios rather than a DataFrame, which leads to an AttributeError when trying to access the `columns` attribute in scenarios where `table` is a Series.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `table` variable is always a DataFrame, regardless of the input parameters. We can achieve this by adding a check for whether `table` is a Series, and if it is, we can convert it to a DataFrame before continuing with the rest of the processing.

Here's the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data, 
    values=None, 
    index=None, 
    columns=None, 
    aggfunc="mean", 
    fill_value=None, 
    margins=False, 
    dropna=True, 
    margins_name="All", 
    observed=False
) -> 'DataFrame':
    # Existing code for the function

    # Adjust for potential Series object returned
    table = table if isinstance(table, DataFrame) else table.to_frame().T

    # The rest of the existing code
```

By adding a check and converting the `table` to a DataFrame when it's a Series, we ensure that subsequent operations can rely on `table` being consistently a DataFrame, resolving the AttributeError issue.

This correction should address the bug and ensure that the `pivot_table` function works as expected for all input scenarios mentioned in the GitHub issue.
