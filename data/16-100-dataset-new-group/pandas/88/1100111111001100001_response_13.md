The bug in the `pivot_table` function seems to be related to the handling of the `columns` parameter when it is a tuple. The function is designed to handle single-level columns as lists, and multi-level columns as tuples. However, it doesn't correctly handle the multi-level columns case, leading to incorrect results and failing tests.

The cause of the bug is that when the `columns` parameter is a tuple, the function doesn't correctly convert it to the format expected for multi-level columns.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to check the type of the `columns` parameter and handle the conversion differently for single-level and multi-level cases. For multi-level cases, the function should convert the tuple to a list of tuples, representing the multi-index columns.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
# Fixed implementation of the pivot_table function
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # (remaining code unchanged)
    else:
        # Convert multi-level columns from tuple to list of tuples
        if isinstance(columns, tuple):
            columns = [columns]
        
        keys = index + columns

        # (remaining code unchanged)
```

With this fix, the function should correctly process multi-level columns as tuples, and the provided test cases should pass.
