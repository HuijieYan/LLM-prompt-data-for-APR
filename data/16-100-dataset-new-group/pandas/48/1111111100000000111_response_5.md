The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object. This issue was reported on GitHub and is related to the new nullable integer data type causing a TypeError when calling `mean` after grouping.

The bug likely stems from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the way it handles the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations like finding the mean. The reported bug suggests that the error occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, `std`, and possibly other aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

To fix this bug, we should focus on the section of the function that deals with aggregation operations on the DataFrameGroupBy object and particularly how it handles the nullable integer data type.

Given the information provided, here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function which includes a fix for handling nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the function
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

In this corrected version, we have removed the complex handling of nullable integer data types and instead used a more straightforward approach to perform the aggregation operations. This should address the issue reported on GitHub related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
