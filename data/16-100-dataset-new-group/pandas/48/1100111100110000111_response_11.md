The error in the buggy function is likely due to incorrect data type conversion, leading to a TypeError when trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64. The `dtype` parameter is expected to be of type 'int64', but the function is attempting to cast it from 'float64', which is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the data type conversion is handled appropriately to avoid casting non-equivalent types. This means checking the data type before attempting to cast and handling the conversion based on the actual data type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual management of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here; it should happen via BlockManager.combine
  
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
  
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
  
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
  
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Perform data type conversion based on the actual type
        if result.dtype != block.dtype:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, cast=True)
  
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
  
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    index = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(index))
  
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
``` 

This corrected version first checks whether the result type matches the block's data type, and, if not, it calls the `maybe_convert_objects` function to perform the necessary type conversion. This ensures that the data type is handled correctly to avoid casting non-equivalent types and resolves the TypeError issue.
