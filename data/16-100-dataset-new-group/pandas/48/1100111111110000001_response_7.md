The error "Cannot safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64" as seen in the failing test indicates that there is an issue with casting the float64 datatype to int64, which is likely caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Given the buggy function provided, it seems that the bug arises from the code attempting to fit float64 values into a DataFrame with an int64 datatype.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function implementation to ensure that it's capable of handling float values properly and avoiding the TypeError mentioned in the error messages. Specifically, you might need to add logic to cast the floating point values to the integer format before attempting any array manipulation.

Here's an updated and corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.to_numeric(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # Rest of the implementation remains unchanged
    # ...
```

Modifying the `data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)` to `data.to_numeric(copy=False)` allows for proper handling of float values in the DataFrame, resolving the TypeError that arises from the original implementation.

By making this adjustment, the corrected function should now pass the failing test.
