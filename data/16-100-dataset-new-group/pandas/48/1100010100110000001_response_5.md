The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function arises due to the inaccurate handling of integer and float values during aggregation. This incorrect handling leads to a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` error.

This bug can be fixed by ensuring that floats are properly handled and converted to integers where appropriate. Specifically, the function should be updated to perform safe casting of integer and float types when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            ...
            ...

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            if not result.values.dtype.is_integer:
                # safely convert result to integer where appropriate
                dtype = result.values.dtype
                dtype = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(dtype, "integer", format="None")
                result = safe_cast(result, dtype, copy=False)
                
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    ...
    ...

def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.
    """
    try:
        return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
    except TypeError as err:
        casted = values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
        if (casted == values).all():
            return casted
        raise TypeError(
            f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
        ) from err
```

The corrected version of the function first attempts to cast the result to an integer using the `safe_cast` function. This function attempts a safe cast and raises a `TypeError` if the values are non-equivalent. The `maybe_convert_objects` function is used to convert the result to a suitable type based on the data.

After making these changes, the `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` error should be resolved, and the corrected function should pass the failing test.
