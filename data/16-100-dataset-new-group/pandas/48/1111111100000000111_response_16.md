The bug in the given function seems to be related to the aggregation of a DataFrameGroupBy object with an 'Int64' data type, resulting in a TypeError when calling the mean function.

The bug originates in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It appears that when calling the `groupby.mean()` on a DataFrame with 'Int64' dtype grouping column, an error is raised. This issue seems to be related to the handling of the 'Int64' data type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the interaction between the 'Int64' data type and the aggregation process in the function. When the function attempts to perform the aggregation with the 'Int64' data type, it encounters a type error.

To fix this bug, we would need to handle the 'Int64' data type specifically within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the mean function and other aggregation functions handle the 'Int64' data type properly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code

    # Check for 'Int64' dtype and handle it explicitly
    if data.dtypes.eq('Int64').any():
        for col in data.select_dtypes('Int64').columns:
            data[col] = data[col].astype('float64')
    
    # existing code
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for 'Int64' dtype and explicitly convert it to 'float64'. This modification should ensure that the mean function and other aggregation functions handle the 'Int64' data type properly without encountering a TypeError.
