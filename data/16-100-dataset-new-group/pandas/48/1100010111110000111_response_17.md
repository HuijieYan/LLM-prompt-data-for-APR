Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the safe casting of nullable integer values to float when applying the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer dtype columns.

The root cause of the bug is that when the `_cython_agg_blocks` function tries to downcast the result to the original dtype, it encounters an issue with the safe casting conversion for nullable integers to floats or other types.

To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to handle the safe casting of nullable integer values to floats when applying aggregation functions. It should take into account the nullable aspect of the integer values.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            # Safe cast the result back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, dtype=block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By using the `convert_dtypes` method and `maybe_convert_objects` function, the corrected function handles the aggregation of nullable integer values and performs the safe casting back to the original dtype if necessary.

With this correction, the `TypeError` encountered during the safe casting process for nullable integers should be resolved.

This revised implementation should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and should resolve the `safe_cast` error message encountered when applying aggregation functions to nullable integer columns.
