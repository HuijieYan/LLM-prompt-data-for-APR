Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug is related to calling the `mean()` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` data type. This results in a TypeError. The bug is at the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The issue has been reported on GitHub with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type and the aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` when used on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. The bug occurs because the `_cython_agg_blocks` function does not handle the nullable integer data type properly when performing aggregation operations.

To fix the bug, the handling of the nullable integer data type needs to be improved when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], pd.Index]:
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks = []
    agg_items = []

    for col, vals in data.iteritems():
        if vals.dtype == 'Int64':
            vals = vals.astype('float64')

        if how == "mean":
            result = vals.mean()
        elif how == "median":
            result = vals.median()
        elif how == "var":
            result = vals.var(ddof=0)

        # Create a new DataFrame with the aggregated value
        agg_df = pd.DataFrame({col: result}, index=[0])
        agg_blocks.append(make_block(agg_df.values, placement=vals.index, klass=Block))

        # Keep track of the columns
        agg_items.append(col)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks = _cython_agg_blocks  # Override the buggy function
```

In the corrected version, we are properly handling the `Int64` data type by converting it to `float64` before performing aggregation operations such as `mean`, `median`, and `var`. Then we create a new DataFrame with the aggregated value and keep track of the columns.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
