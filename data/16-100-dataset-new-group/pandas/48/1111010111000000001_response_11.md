Based on the bug and the failing test, it seems that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function fails to handle the aggregation of nullable integers when using `nan` as the default aggregation method. The use of `pd.NA` (Pandas missing value for nullable integer type) triggers this failure, leading to incorrect aggregation results.

To fix this bug, you need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in a way that correctly handles the aggregation of nullable integers. The correct approach would be to convert `pd.NA` to `np.nan` before the aggregation process.

Here’s the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # Convert pd.NA to np.nan
    data = data.fillna(value=np.nan)
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the code…
```

With this modification, the function should correctly handle the aggregation of nullable integers, ensuring that the failing test passes.
