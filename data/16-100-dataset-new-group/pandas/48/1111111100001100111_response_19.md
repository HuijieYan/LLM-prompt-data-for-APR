The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be related to a GitHub issue titled 'calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError', where the user reported that using the new nullable integer data type calls to mean after grouping results in a TypeError.

After analyzing the provided runtime values and types of the variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue arises from the handling of the `Int64` datatype. The `Block` data of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function may be dealing with the `Int64` datatype in a way that triggers a TypeError.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure proper handling of the `Int64` datatype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, especially when calling methods like `mean`, `median`, or `std`. This might involve updating the way the `Int64` type is processed within the function to avoid the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... existing code

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except TypeError:
            # Handle TypeError for Int64 dtype
            if block.values.dtype.kind == 'i':
                result = block.values.astype(float).mean(axis=1, skipna=True)

        # ... existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we've added a specific handling for the `Int64` datatype inside the loop that processes the blocks. If a TypeError is encountered for the `Int64` dtype, we use the `astype(float)` method to convert the datatype to float and then calculate the mean.

This approach should resolve the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub thread when calling methods like `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with the `Int64` dtype.
