The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype. This issue arises when calling certain aggregation methods after grouping, such as `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

Based on the provided runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of the `Int64` dtype when performing aggregation methods on grouped data.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the `Int64` dtype when performing aggregation operations, such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This may involve modifying the type coercion, casting, or data transformation steps to correctly handle the `Int64` dtype in the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle non-numeric aggregation errors
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            result = self._handle_alt_agg(block, alt)

            if result is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        # handle dtype casting for Int64
        if is_int64_dtype(block.dtype) and is_float_dtype(result.dtype):
            result = result.astype('Int64')

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I added a section to handle dtype casting for `Int64`. This ensures that if the original block has an `Int64` dtype and the result of the aggregation is a float, it will be properly cast back to the `Int64` dtype.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug of calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.
