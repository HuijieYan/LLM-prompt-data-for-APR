Based on the GitHub issue provided, the bug occurs when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The bug does not occur when using int64 dtype or when taking a single column to create a SeriesGroupBy.

The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is a part of the GroupBy module in pandas and is responsible for performing aggregation on grouped data. The bug is likely related to the handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) during the aggregation process.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be updated to properly handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) during the aggregation process. Specifically, it needs to be updated to correctly cast the result back to the original dtype and handle the nullable integers.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is no_result:
            deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        else:
            if how == "ohlc" and alt is None:
                agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
            else:
                try:
                    agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                    if block.is_extension:
                        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, copy=True)
                    result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
                    agg_blocks.append(make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items))
                except (DataError, SpecificationError):
                    deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of the nullable integer data type (Int64) during the aggregation process is improved to prevent the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub bug.

After implementing the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the issue with calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype should be resolved.
