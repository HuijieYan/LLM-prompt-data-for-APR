First of all, let's understand that there's no issue with the function's code itself, but with the interaction between the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and the new nullable integer data type introduced in Pandas. The issue as described by the GitHub user is that calling `mean` after grouping results in a TypeError when the DataFrame has a column of nullable integer data type (`Int64`).

The bug is likely to be caused by the interaction of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method with the nullable integer data type. It seems that the function is not handling this data type appropriately, resulting in a TypeError when `mean` is called after grouping.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly. This may involve checking the data type of the columns within the method and handling the nullable integer values appropriately.

Additionally, the bug might also be related to how the generic aggregation functions in Pandas (such as `mean`, `median`, etc.) handle the nullable integer data type when used with `DataFrameGroupBy` objects. This could involve modifying the generic aggregation functions to handle nullable integer data type columns within grouped data.

Here's a potential correct version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method that handles the nullable integer data type:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
            # Handle nullable integer data type appropriately
            result = block.values.astype(float)
        else:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the method...
```

This potential fix involves checking the data type of the blocks within the method and handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) appropriately.

It's important to note that this is just a potential fix based on the information available, and the actual fix might involve more complexity depending on the specific issues within the interaction of `DataFrameGroupBy` and the nullable integer data type.
