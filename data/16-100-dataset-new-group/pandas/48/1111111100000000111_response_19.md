The bug seems to be related to the introduction of the nullable integer data type (Int64) in pandas. The error is occurring when calling the `mean` function after grouping using the new nullable integer data type.

The bug is located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. It seems to be happening due to a type error when trying to perform the aggregation operation.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the nullable integer data type differently when performing the aggregation. This may involve casting the data to a suitable type and restructuring the aggregation logic.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                # Check if the block has Nullable integer data type
                if getattr(block.dtype, "kind", None) == 'i':
                    # Cast block to float for aggregation to avoid type error
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                        block.values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
                else:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                        block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Rest of the code remains unchanged
                # ...
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if the block has a nullable integer data type and cast it to a float for aggregation to avoid the type error. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
