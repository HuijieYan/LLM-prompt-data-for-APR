The bug seems to be in the section where the code is trying to handle non-numeric data, particularly in the case where the "how" type is "var". The input data is being aggregated using the "var" function to compute the variance of non-numeric values, such as NA (`pd.NA`), which leads to the failure of the function.

The bug can be fixed by updating the code to handle such non-numeric elements, especially when calculating statistical measures like variance. This may involve filtering out the non-numeric values or using a different method for computing the aggregation.

Here's a corrected version of the function that attempts to address the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if all(pd.isna(value) for value in block.values):
            # handling case where all values are NA, returning NA
            result = np.array([np.nan] * len(locs)).reshape(1, -1)
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        if result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        # ... (handle the result and creating agg_block)

        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated version includes a check for NA values in the data. If all the values in a block are NA, it returns NA. If there are non-NA values in the block, it proceeds with the aggregation, ensuring that non-numeric values are handled properly and do not cause the function to fail.

Please note that more details about the code logic and further context would be necessary to provide a fully complete and accurate correction. Therefore, the code provided is a general improvement without a complete understanding of the broader context.
