The potential error locations may include not properly handling exceptions, missing data type casting, and potentially incorrect block operations.

The cause of the bug may be due to the mishandling of exceptions, data type casting issues, and improper block manipulation.

To fix the bug:
1. Properly handle exceptions and define alternative approaches for cases where an exception is caught.
2. Ensure that the result is properly casted back to the original data type if feasible.
3. Verify the correctness of block operations and indices manipulation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Manage data via BlockManager.combine
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue
            # Using an alternate approach in case of exception
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                result = result.to_numpy()

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items

```

In this corrected version, I have removed unnecessary usage of lists `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames` since they did not seem relevant to the logic. I have also included corrections related to exception handling and data type casting for the result. The function now focuses on aggregating blocks and ensuring proper error handling.
