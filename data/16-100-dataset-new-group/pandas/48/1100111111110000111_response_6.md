Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue provided, the bug seems to occur when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object containing columns of Int64 dtype.

The issue is likely to be caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This function attempts to convert array values from float64 to int64 when performing aggregation, which results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer values more gracefully. You can adjust the logic to use float64 values when appropriate, while ensuring that the resulting data maintains the desired format.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)

            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version ensures that the aggregation results are converted to the appropriate format and meets the expectations defined in the failing tests and the GitHub issue.

Once the corrected version is applied, the issue should be resolved, and the failing tests should pass without raising a TypeError.
