We see that the `np.array` in the failing cases has inconsistent values compared to the `DataFrame` `self.obj` right before the buggy function's return. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to work on the `BlockManager` `data` extracted from `self._get_data_to_aggregate()` based on `_cython_agg_blocks` method. However, considering the resulting `np.array`, it looks like the DataFrame `self.obj` is not being processed accurately before reaching the buggy function.

To fix this buggy function, we should first verify that the data (`self.obj`) is being converted into the expected format before it's passed to `_cython_agg_blocks`. Then, within the function, we should ensure that the processing of the `BlockManager` data is accurate.

Let's provide a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    indexer = np.arange(len(data))
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Process the data for aggregation
        if block.is_extension:
            result = block.values.astype(float)  # Convert to float for numeric operations
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Aggregate and construct the final arrays for return
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected function, we first process the data based on the `numeric_only` condition. Then, we iterate through the blocks and handle the aggregation and result construction differently based on the block type. This should ensure that the data is processed accurately and the function can produce the intended result for given cases.

It's important to re-test this corrected function with the failing test cases provided to ensure that the bug is fixed effectively.
