The error message from the failing test indicates a TypeError when attempting to cast a float64 array to an int64 array, due to the non-equivalent nature of the data. The affected function is `_cython_agg_blocks` and its block value manipulation.

A potential error location within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is the type casting in the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function. This may be causing the non-equivalent casting conflict between float64 and int64, which raises a TypeError.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the `_cython_agg_blocks` function by adding explicit dtype casting for each array transformation to ensure that non-equivalent types don't raise a TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    if result.dtype == np.float64:
        result = result.astype(np.int64, copy=False)

    # ... existing code ...
```
In this version, we explicitly cast the result to int64 if it's originally of dtype float64. This should ensure the types are properly aligned and eliminates the non-equivalent type issue.

After implementing this fix, running the failing test again should now result in a successful outcome without any TypeError.
