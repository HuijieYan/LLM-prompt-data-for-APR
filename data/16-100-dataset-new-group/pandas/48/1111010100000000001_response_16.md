The potential bug in the provided function is likely related to the handling of split items and frames. The function is intended to aggregate data based on certain criteria, but the process of splitting and handling object-dtype blocks may be leading to unexpected results and exceptions.

To fix the bug, a strategy can be to re-evaluate the logic used to handle split items and frames when performing the aggregation. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the error handling mechanisms and ensure that exceptions are properly caught and handled in a way that preserves the integrity of the aggregation process.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Perform necessary cleanup, if any
    agg_blocks, new_items = cleanup_blocks(agg_blocks, new_items)

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

In the corrected version, the function iterates through the blocks and directly aggregates the data without handling any alternate scenarios or exceptions. The `cleanup_blocks` function is called to handle any necessary cleaning up of the aggregated blocks and items. By simplifying the logic and minimizing the conditional statements, the potential for unexpected behaviors and bugs is reduced.
