The problem occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The `values` inside this function are being casted from `float64` to `int64`, which is triggering a `TypeError` because the rule set for casting the values is "safe". This is happening due to the presence of mixed data types in the original dataframe `values`. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the provided column values are suitable for a safe cast to the selected `int64` dtype. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    block_values = data.values
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for label, block in block_values.items():
        result = np.array([])
        if block.dtype.kind in ["i", "u", "f"] and not pd.isnull(block).all():
            result = getattr(block, how)(axis=1, skipna=True, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(label)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items.take(new_items)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the appropriate dtype checking and application of the `getattr` method have been added. This version ensures that the values can be safely cast to the target dtype and handles the aggregation process accordingly. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue identified in the failing tests.
