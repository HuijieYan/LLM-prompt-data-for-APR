### Analysis
The bug occurs when calling the `_cython_agg_blocks` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the `mean` method. This function is intended to aggregate data within a `DataFrameGroupBy` object, but it currently fails for certain cases, as evidenced by the GitHub issue regarding the `Int64` data type and the `mean` method.

The bug is likely occurring in the handling of the parameters and the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It appears that the function does not handle the `Int64` data type correctly, leading to a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` method on the `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

### Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by a failure to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This may be due to the function's handling of numeric data, dtype inference, or the way it interacts with the aggregating methods like `mean`, `median`, or `std`. The failure to handle `Int64` correctly leads to a `TypeError` during the aggregation process.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle the `Int64` data type. This likely involves ensuring that the numeric aggregation methods such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` can accept and process the `Int64` data type.

The fix may involve modifying the aggregation logic, checking for compatibility with the `Int64` type, and ensuring that the appropriate data type handling is performed to avoid the `TypeError`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # Check for nullable integer type and convert to regular integer type
        if data._data.get_numeric_data().dtype.name == 'Int64':
            data = data._data.apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

In the fixed function, we check for the presence of `Int64` data type before aggregation, and if found, convert it to a regular integer type to ensure compatibility with the aggregation methods.

Note: The function implementation is simplified here for illustration, and the actual fix may involve deeper analysis and modifications.
