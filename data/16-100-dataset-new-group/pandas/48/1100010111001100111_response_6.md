## Bug analysis
The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem that occurs when calling the `mean` method after grouping a DataFrame with columns of type `Int64`. This results in a TypeError. The issue also states that the error does not occur when calling other aggregation methods such as `min`, `max`, or `first`, but also occurs with `median` and `std`.

The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations, resulting in a TypeError.

## Bug cause
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the pandas library and is used for grouping and performing aggregation operations on the grouped data. The function has conditional logic to handle numeric data and performs aggregation operations like mean, median, etc. However, its handling of nullable data (`Int64`) appears to be incorrect, leading to a TypeError when certain aggregation methods are called after grouping.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to correctly handle nullable integer data (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations. This involves updating the conditional logic and data handling to ensure that calling aggregation methods like `mean`, `median`, and `var` after grouping with nullable integer data does not result in a TypeError.

## Bug fix
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should include updated conditional logic and data handling to handle nullable integer (`Int64`) data appropriately when performing aggregation operations. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_common_type()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[Tuple[BlockPlacement, np.ndarray]] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        result = no_result
        agged = False

        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.obj._get_axis(0), min_count=min_count
            )
            agged = True
        except (TypeError, DataError):
            pass

        if agged and result is not no_result:
            # Convert result to a Block if necessary
            result_block = maybe_convert_objects(
                make_block(result).astype(data.dtypes[locs])
            )
            new_items.append((locs, result_block.values))
            agg_blocks.append(result_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take_many_direct(new_items)
```

In the corrected version of the function, `convert_to_common_type` is used to ensure that the data is in a common type, and the aggregation operations are performed accordingly. Additionally, `maybe_convert_objects` is used to convert the result to a Block if necessary.

By incorporating these changes, the corrected function should handle nullable integer data (`Int64`) appropriately when performing aggregation operations, ensuring that the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue is resolved.
