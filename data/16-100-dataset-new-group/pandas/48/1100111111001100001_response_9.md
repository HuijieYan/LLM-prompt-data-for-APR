The bug that is causing the function to fail lies in the way it is handling empty data when filtering and aggregating numeric data. The issue arises from the problematic treatment of the data and the application of aggregation methods, particularly in scenarios with empty or non-numeric data.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve adding an extra check to validate data integrity before performing aggregation. This could help prevent the application of the aggregation methods to empty or non-numeric data.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        if len(data.blocks) == 0:
             raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
        no_result = object()
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Rest of the code for iterating and aggregating blocks remains the same
```

By adding the conditional check before entering the loop, we can prevent the execution of aggregation methods in scenarios where there is no numeric data. This will ensure that the behavior of the function is correct when dealing with empty data and potential edge cases, leading to more reliable and robust behavior.
