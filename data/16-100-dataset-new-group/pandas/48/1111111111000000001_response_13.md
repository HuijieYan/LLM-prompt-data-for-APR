The function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be intended for aggregation, but due to its complexity, it is throwing an error that causes the failing test to not pass. This leads to a bug in the aggregation process, preventing the correct results from being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the function is performing multiple checks and operations in a loop that is supposed to handle the aggregation of data. The extensive checks and operations within the loop are causing incorrect results to be returned, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the loop that iterates over the data blocks and attempts to perform aggregation operations should be refactored. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to simplify the operations within the loop and ensure that the aggregation process is handled correctly for different types of input data.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # Cast back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In the corrected version, the loop has been simplified to only perform the aggregation operation and cast back to the original dtype. This should ensure that the aggregation process is handled correctly and the correct results are returned, passing the failing test.
