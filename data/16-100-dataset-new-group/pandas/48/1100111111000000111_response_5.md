The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function arises because it is failing to properly handle the new nullable integer data type when calling mean after grouping, leading to a TypeError. The cause of the bug is the failure to handle the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations, such as mean, on a DataFrameGroupBy.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the new nullable integer data type appropriately when performing aggregation operations. This can be achieved by adding a branch to handle the specific behavior of the nullable integer data type when computing the mean. The implementation must take into account the possibility of NA values and handle them appropriately when calculating the mean within the grouped data.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    result_data = data._reduce(how, axis=1, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count)

    if alt is not None:
        non_numeric_data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False, numeric_only=False)
        alt_result_data = non_numeric_data._reduce(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis), axis=1)
        result_data = result_data.combine_first(alt_result_data)

    return result_data.blocks, result_data.items
```

In the corrected version, the `result_data` is obtained by reducing the data with the specified `how` operation, taking into account the `numeric_only` and `min_count` options. If an alternate function (`alt`) is provided, non-numeric data is separately reduced with the alternate function. Finally, the results are combined using `combine_first` method to handle nullable integer values appropriately.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub and also pass the failing test.
