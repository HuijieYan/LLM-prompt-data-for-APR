The cause of the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the handling of nullable integer data types when calculating aggregate statistics, such as mean, median, and variance.

The issue arises when the `DataFrameGroupBy` object returned by `pd.DataFrame(values, dtype="Int64").groupby("a")` is used to calculate aggregate statistics like `mean`, `median`, or `var`. The error occurs when the function tries to cast the result of the aggregation from a float 64 to an int 64, which is not possible due to the presence of nullable integer data types.

The corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should take into account the special handling required for nullable integer data types when calculating aggregate statistics.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[Int64Index] = []

    for name, group in self:
        try:
            result = group._cython_operation(
                "aggregate", how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, DataError):
            try:
                result = group.aggregate(how)
            except TypeError as e:
                # Handle exceptions and perform an alternate aggregation
                result = group.aggregate(alt)

        # Convert safely to nullable integer dtype
        if is_any_int_dtype(result) and result.ndim == 1 and not is_extension_array_dtype(result):
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)._mgr

        # Append the aggregated result to the list
        agg_blocks.append(make_block(result, group.items, group.blocks[0].ref_items, axis=0))
        agg_items.append(group.grouper.result_index)

    return agg_blocks, self._result_index
```

By handling the nullable integer data types appropriately during the aggregation process, the function can avoid the TypeError that occurs when trying to cast the result from float64 to int64. This version of the function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread and allow the `agg` and `apply` operations to execute successfully without any casting errors related to nullable integer data types.
