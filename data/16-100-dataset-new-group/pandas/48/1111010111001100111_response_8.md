The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is causing errors when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.

Based on the analysis of the failing tests and the runtime input/output values, it seems that the issue may be related to data type conversions and the handling of nullable integer values in the calculation of aggregate functions within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. 

To fix the bug, a potential strategy would be to explicitly handle the case of nullable integer values in the calculation of aggregate functions. This can involve checks for null values and appropriate type conversions or handling of nullable integers within the function.

Here is a corrected and modified version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that includes handling for nullable integer values when calculating aggregate functions:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Handle nullable integers for the 'mean' and 'median' functions
    if how in ['mean', 'median']:
        data = data._astype('float', copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... other existing code ...
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, a check is added to explicitly handle nullable integer values for the 'mean' and 'median' functions by converting them to float data type. This modification aims to address the type conversion and handling issues related to nullable integer values when calculating aggregate functions within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

By making these modifications, we aim to address the specific issue reported in the GitHub ticket and ensure that the corrected function works correctly for nullable integer values when calculating aggregate functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

After making these changes, the function can be tested with the original failing tests to ensure that the issue is resolved. If the corrected function passes the failing tests, it would resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
