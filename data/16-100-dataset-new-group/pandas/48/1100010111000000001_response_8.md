Looking at the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it appears that one potential error location is when handling the `deleted_items`. There seems to be an issue with the adjustment of the indexer to account for the items that have been removed. This could be causing the buggy behavior leading to failing tests. The cause of the bug is that the adjustment of the indexer for the deleted items may not be properly updating the indexes, which subsequently leads to incorrect results or exceptions.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and test the adjustment of the indexer for the deleted items, ensuring that it correctly reflects the removal of the items and that it is done consistently to prevent any unexpected failures.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...
        
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        adjustment = np.where(np.in1d(indexer, deleted))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            # Adjust the indexer
            adjusted_locs = indexer[offset:(offset + loc)]
            adjusted_locs = np.delete(adjusted_locs, adjustment)
            blk.mgr_locs = adjusted_locs
            offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we revised the adjustment of the indexer to account for the deleted items by using `np.where` and `np.delete` to properly adjust the indexes and avoid any incorrect results. This should fix the bug and the failing tests associated with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
