The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not returning the expected output when the test function `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` from the file `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py` is executed. It is failing to handle nullable integer type data properly.

The potential error locations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function include the issues with handling nullable integer types and the `min_count` parameter.

The `min_count` parameter defines the threshold count of non-na attributes required to aggregate the result. It is causing an issue when set to -1, which should not be the case.

To fix this, we need to check if the `min_count` value is -1 when the `numeric_only` parameter is True, and handle the aggregation and blocks accordingly.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if min_count == -1 and numeric_only:
                min_count = 0  # Handle the case when min_count is -1 and numeric_only is True

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

With the above fix, the function should correctly handle the nullable integer type data and the `min_count` parameter, providing the expected result for the failing test case.
