The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not correctly handling the numeric aggregation like 'mean', 'median', and 'var' when the dataframe `self.obj` contains nullable integer values. As a result, it fails to handle certain types of `blocks` causing test failures.

The issue seems to be related to the cycling through each block in `data.blocks` and the logic encapsulated in the try-except block when calling `aggregate` on `self.grouper` within the for loop. The exception isn't being caught for some cases, and the subsequent logic might not handle nullable integer values correctly.

To fix the bug, it's first necessary to identify which parts of the function are responsible for the mishandling of nullable integer values and adjust their behavior.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = None
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except Exception as e:
            pass
        
        if result is None:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        
        if result is not None and not isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype)
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.flatten()
        
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or new_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:(offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we handle the exceptions better by explicitly catching all exceptions and address the conditional behavior when `result` is None. The logic to handle nullable integer values is also added to reduce errors.

This revised function should fix the issue and pass the failing test cases.
