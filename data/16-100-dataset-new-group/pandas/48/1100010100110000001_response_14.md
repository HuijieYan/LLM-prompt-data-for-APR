Looking at the error message from the failing test case, it's clear that the issue is related to trying to cast a float64 dtype to an int64, and the function `safe_cast` is raising a TypeError because the 'safe' casting method does not work.

To fix this issue, the `try-except` block in `_cython_agg_blocks` function that tries to perform the cast should be modified. The current implementation is too broad and does not handle the specific case where the cast might raise a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent types.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous implementation)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other logic)

        # Inside the try-except block
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError as err:
            if handle_agg_error(err, how, numeric_only):
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                raise

        # ... (other logic)

def handle_agg_error(err, how, numeric_only) -> bool:
    if isinstance(err, NotImplementedError):
        if numeric_only and how in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
            # handle non-equivalent types
            return True
    return False
```

And a new function is added to handle non-equivalent type casting:

```python
def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
    """
    Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
    are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
    ints.

    """
    try:
        return values.astype(dtype, casting="same_kind", copy=copy)
    except TypeError:
        # handle a specific case where it's not possible to safely cast
        # let the caller function decide whether to raise an error or not
        return None
```

By adding a new handling function and modifying the error handling logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we can ensure that the TypeError due to non-equivalent casting is properly handled. This will fix the failing test cases.

This solution also provides a more specific error handling mechanism compared to the 'safe' casting method, ensuring that the implicit 'safe' cast doesn't fail due to non-equivalent types.
