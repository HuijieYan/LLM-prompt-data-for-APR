It appears that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is correctly processing the input data and generating the expected aggregation results. However, the failing test cases indicate that the function is not behaving as expected. This suggests that the bug may be located in the code surrounding the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, or possibly in another part of the codebase.

To address the bug in the function, we should first look for any issues in the surrounding context. The issue might be with how the function is being called, or there might be conflicting or incorrect data being passed to the function. Additionally, it would be beneficial to check if there are any relevant changes in other parts of the codebase that could be causing the failed tests.

As a strategy for fixing the bug, I suggest the following steps:
1. Review the calling functions in the code to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is being called correctly and with the appropriate input data.
2. Examine any recent changes in the codebase that might affect the behavior of the function.
3. Verify that the input data provided for each test case is consistent with the expected behavior of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Once the context of the function call has been verified and any relevant changes have been reviewed, we can consider making adjustments to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Given the complexity of the function and the interdependencies with other parts of the codebase, any changes should be tested thoroughly to ensure that they do not introduce new issues.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function based on the assumption that the function logic and surrounding context are correct:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = data._reduce(how, axis='columns')

    return agg_blocks
```
This corrected version uses the `_reduce` method of the BlockManager to apply the aggregation function correctly across the specified axis. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected and that it passes the failing test cases.
