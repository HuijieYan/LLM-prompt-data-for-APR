After analyzing the buggy function, related functions, and failing test code, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when applying aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` within grouped data.

The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function might be caused by the way the `grouper.aggregate` method is handling the input data, especially when dealing with nullable integer data type (`Int64`), leading to a `TypeError` in certain cases.

To fix this bug, we can start by checking the expected behavior of aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` when applied to grouped data with nullable integer data type. We also need to ensure that the `grouper.aggregate` method can handle `Int64` data type correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should address the bug and pass the failing test:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous code)

    # Check if the data has nullable integers and convert them to regular integers for aggregation
    if "Int64" in data.dtypes.values and how in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
        idx = data.items
        new_data = data.astype("float64")
        for pos, col in enumerate(data.columns):
            if data.dtypes[pos] == "Int64":
                new_data[col] = data[col].astype("float64")
        data = new_data

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

By adding the conditional check for handling nullable integers and converting them to regular floats if the aggregation function is `mean`, `median`, or `var`, we can address the issue related to calling the `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a `TypeError`.

After applying this fix, the function should now correctly handle the aggregation of nullable integer data and pass the failing test.

Please note that this fix assumes that the bug originates from the handling of `Int64` data type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. If the issue is caused by a different root cause, further investigation and modification might be necessary.
