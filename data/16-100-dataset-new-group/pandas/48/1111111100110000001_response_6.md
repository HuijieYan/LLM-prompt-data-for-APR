The error is caused by the attempt to safely cast a non-equivalent float64 to int64. This occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.

The strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the data being aggregated is correctly cast to the appropriate type before applying the aggregation function. We need to carefully cast the data to the appropriate type to avoid casting errors.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code ...

    # Safely convert data to appropriate types
    for i, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        # If the block is object-dtype and contains non-numeric data, skip it
        if block.is_object or not np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.number) or not numeric_only:
            continue
        if block.is_extension:
            try:
                data.blocks[i] = block.maybe_convert_objects(convert_dates=True, convert_numeric=True)
            except (SpecificationError, DataError, ValueError):
                # Data cannot be safely converted, skip this block
                continue
        else:
            data.blocks[i] = block.maybe_downcast_numeric()

    agg_blocks = []

    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items = []
    split_frames = []

    # existing code ...
```

In this corrected version, we are safely converting the DataFrame's blocks to the appropriate types before aggregation, by handling object-dtype blocks and downcasting numeric dtype blocks. This would avoid the casting errors and result in a successful aggregation process.

Once this change has been made, the function should pass the failing test.
