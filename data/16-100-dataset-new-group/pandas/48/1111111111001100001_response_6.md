The given buggy function is supposed to perform an aggregation operation on a DataFrameGroupBy object. It encounters certain issues where it tries to perform the aggregation and then handle the output, which results in incorrect results.

The buggy function _cython_agg_blocks() seems to be incorrectly handling the aggregation of data. It processes blocks of data by grouped values and tries to perform aggregation like mean, median, or variance on the non-NA/null values. However, it incorrectly processes the aggregation results, stores them in agg_blocks, and then performs additional manipulation to adjust the locs in the blocks. These manipulations are not handling non-numeric data correctly, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for handling the aggregation and data blocks in the _cython_agg_blocks() function and ensure that the data manipulation and aggregation results are correctly handled.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Perform aggregation using pandas API
    result = data.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

    # Reconstruct the aggregated blocks
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = [data.blocks[0].make_block(result.values.T)]

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we are using the pandas API directly to perform aggregation, which handles both numeric and non-numeric data properly. The agg() method is used to perform the aggregation, and the results are used to construct the aggregated blocks directly.

This corrected version should address the issues observed in the failing tests and provide the expected aggregated results.
