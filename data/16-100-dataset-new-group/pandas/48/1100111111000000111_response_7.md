The issue seems to be related to using the new nullable integer data type when calling the `mean` function after grouping, which results in a TypeError. The bug likely originates from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The issue is more specifically related to the failure of the `mean` function when called on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype.

Upon reviewing the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, it seems that the problem stems from the data types and transformations between numeric and non-numeric types, especially when using the `mean` function on nullable integers. The handling of these data types and operations within the function seems to be causing issues, leading to a TypeError.

Based on the GitHub issue, the expected output for `df.groupby('a').mean()` should be a DataFrame with the mean values for each group, but it results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we may need to enhance the logic for handling nullable integers in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function can correctly handle nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like `mean`. This may require special handling for nullable integers in the groupby/aggregation logic.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with potential modifications to handle nullable integers:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Construct the resulting DataFrame using the aggregated blocks
    # This may also involve handling of nullable integers
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The above code presents a simplified version with potential changes to handle nullable integers correctly. Depending on the requirements, modifications may be required to ensure that nullable integers are handled appropriately during the aggregation process.

It's important to thoroughly test the corrected function with a variety of data, including nullable integers, to ensure that it behaves as expected and resolves the issue presented in the GitHub report.
