To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to ensure that values of type float64 can be safely converted to int64 when necessary. The error is occurring when attempting to cast numpy arrays of float64 dtype to int64, which is not supported.

We need to check for this type of data and handle it appropriately, potentially by changing the dtype of the dataframe to a compatible type before performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Rest of the code remains the same...

        # ...existing code that performs aggregation on blocks...

        if result is not no_result:
            if node_result.dtype != np.dtype('int64'):
                result = result.astype('float64').round(0)  # Round to convert to int64

            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # the rest of the existing code remains unchanged...

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

This code checks if the resulting dtype of a block is not int64 and converts it to int64 by rounding it. This should ensure that float64 values are appropriately handled when attempting to cast to int64 during the aggregation process. This correction should resolve the TypeError issue when calling mean, median, and var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
