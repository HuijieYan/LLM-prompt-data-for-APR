The error seems to be related to casting a float to an integer, causing a 'TypeError'. The type of error suggests that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` is not handling the type conversion properly.

One potential error is in the line of code, specifically where the function attempts to cast data using `result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)`. This line of code is responsible for attempting to cast the result to the original data type but may be causing the casting issue.

To fix the bug, you need to handle the type casting correctly when results are being processed. One strategy could be to ensure that when the data is being processed and aggregated, the original data type is preserved and appropriately handled.

Here is the corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self,
        how: str,
        alt=None,
        numeric_only: bool = True,
        min_count: int = -1,
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if len(result) == 0:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if block.dtype.name.startswith('int') and result.dtype.name.startswith('float'):
            # Safely cast Int to Float
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.extend(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected, version, the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function has been replaced with code that performs finer control over type conversion based on the original data type and the result. This should fix the type casting issue and prevent the 'TypeError' when attempting to cast float to integer.

This modified version should be able to handle the type conversion correctly and pass the failing tests.
