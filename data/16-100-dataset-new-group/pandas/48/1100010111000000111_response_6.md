The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This issue is documented in the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

The cause of this bug is likely due to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It seems that the function is not handling the `Int64` dtype properly when performing the aggregation operation, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, a strategy would be to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to correctly handle the `Int64` dtype when performing aggregation operations. Specifically, the function should identify when the input data has nullable integer data type and adjust the aggregation process accordingly to prevent the TypeError.

The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    # Check if the data has nullable integer dtype (Int64)
    if hasattr(data.blocks[0], "is_nullable_integer_dtype") and data.blocks[0].is_nullable_integer_dtype:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only
            )
        except TypeError:
            # Handle the nullable integer dtype gracefully
            try:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only
                )
            except Exception as e:
                raise e
    else:
        # Standard aggregation operation for non-nullable integer dtypes
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the input data has nullable integer dtype (`Int64`). If it does, we attempt to handle the aggregation operation differently by converting the values to float before aggregation. If the standard aggregation operation still fails, we raise the exception to signal a potential issue with the nullable integer dtype.

After applying this correction to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it should now handle the `Int64` dtype properly when performing aggregation operations, resolving the TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype.
