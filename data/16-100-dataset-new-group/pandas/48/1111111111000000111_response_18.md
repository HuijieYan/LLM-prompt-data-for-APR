The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is experiencing a bug when applying certain aggregation functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer dtype. This results in a TypeError, as reported in the GitHub issue. The issue is likely related to the handling of nullable integer dtype when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

The potential locations of error are identified in the `for` loop, where an exception may occur when trying to aggregate the data, leading to the TypeError. Another potential issue stems from the `if` condition for `split_items`, where the logic for handling split blocks might be incorrect.

To fix the bug, a strategy is to specifically handle the nullable integer data type when applying aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` to ensure that the TypeError does not occur.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Exclude the block if the operation cannot be performed
            assert how == "ohlc"
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue
        except TypeError:
            # Handle nullable integer data type specifically
            if block.is_nullable_integer:
                # Convert to float
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            else:
                raise

        # rest of the code...

    # rest of the code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we specifically handle the case where the block has a nullable integer dtype by converting it to float when applying the aggregation function. This approach ensures that the TypeError does not occur when applying aggregation functions to nullable integer data.
