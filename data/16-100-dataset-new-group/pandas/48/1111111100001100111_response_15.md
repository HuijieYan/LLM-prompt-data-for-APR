Based on the GitHub issue and the related tests information, it seems that the bug occurs when certain aggregation functions, such as `mean`, `median`, and `std`, are applied to a DataFrameGroupBy where the input data has a nullable integer data type (`Int64`). The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, and it also does not occur when taking a single column to give a `SeriesGroupBy`.

The likely cause of the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function could be due to the way it handles null values (as indicated by the `TypeError` in the GitHub issue) when applying the aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function correctly handles nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when the aggregation functions `mean`, `median`, and `std` are applied.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This version simplifies the handling of aggregation and eliminates the need to perform manual type casting and exception handling for the nullable integer data type (`Int64`). It uses the `self.grouper.aggregate` to directly apply the aggregation functions to the block values for the specified operation.

With this correction, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now correctly handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when the aggregation functions `mean`, `median`, and `std` are applied to the DataFrameGroupBy.
