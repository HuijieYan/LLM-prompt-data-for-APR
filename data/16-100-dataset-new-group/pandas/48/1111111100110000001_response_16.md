Looking at the error message and the buggy function, it appears that the issue is with casting a non-equivalent float64 to int64 due to the casting rule 'safe'. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is somehow trying to cast a float64 to int64 using the `safe_cast` function, which results in a TypeError. This is likely due to an incompatibility between the input data and the target dtype during casting.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data is properly handled before casting to int64. One possible strategy is to check the input data and cast to the target dtype only if the data is equivalent to the target dtype.

Below is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            # Check if the dtype of result matches the dtype of block
            result = result if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 2 else np.array(result, dtype=block.dtype)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we added a check to verify if the dtype of the result matches the dtype of the input block. If they don't match, the result is converted to an array with the same dtype as the block. This should handle the safe casting error and ensure that the data is properly cast before aggregation. After these changes, the corrected version of the function should pass the failing test.
