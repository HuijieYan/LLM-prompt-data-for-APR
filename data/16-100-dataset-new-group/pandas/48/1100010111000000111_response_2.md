The bug is occurring in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function is failing to correctly aggregate data when the `dtype` parameter is 'Int64', resulting in a TypeError when the `mean` function is called after grouping.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle nullable integer data types (Int64) properly when performing aggregation operations. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user encounters a TypeError when calling the `mean` function after grouping using a DataFrame with 'Int64' dtype.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be updated to handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the given function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric_only=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the `get_numeric_data(copy=False)` has been replaced with `convert(numeric_only=True)` to properly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation operations.

With this fix, the function should now handle nullable integer data types correctly and pass the failing test case mentioned in the GitHub issue.
