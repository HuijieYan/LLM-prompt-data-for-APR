The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function stems from its handling of the `block` and `result` variables. The function is expecting a 2D array as the `result` output, but in some cases, it receives a 1D array. This leads to a TypeError when attempting to reshape the 1D array to match the expected dimensions.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle cases where the result may be a 1D array differently and reshape it appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the NotImplementedError and alternative calculation here 
            pass

        # The rest of the function remains the same...
```

By checking the type of the `result` and handling the 1D case separately, we can avoid the TypeError and ensure that the function reshapes the result appropriately.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the different input cases correctly.
