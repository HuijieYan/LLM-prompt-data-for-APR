## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` methods on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with a column of type `Int64`. The internals of these methods try to convert a float array to an integer, which is not allowed with the safe casting rule. This results in a `TypeError` and prevents the calculations from proceeding.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely in the calculation functions for `mean`, `median`, and `var` when called on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of type `Int64`.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is a failure to handle nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly when performing calculations in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class for methods like `mean`, `median`, and `var`. The functions fail to handle conversion from float to integer according to the safe casting rule, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Fix Strategy
The fix would be to modify the calculation functions for `mean`, `median`, and `var` methods to properly handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`). This could involve explicitly casting to float before the calculation, ensuring that the result is compatible with the original data type.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Collect individual blocks, then perform calculations
    agg_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Here we avoid performing the operation in an alternate way if it's not available for Int64
        if isinstance(block.values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray) and np.issubdtype(block.dtype, float):
            # Handle nullable integer type specifically
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
            else:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
                # Convert to float
                result = result.astype(float) 
                # Create a new block with the result
                agg_block = block.make_block(result)
                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # ... existing code ...

    # ... remaining code ...
```

The `DataFrameGroupBy` class's `_cython_agg_blocks` function is modified to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) by explicitly casting the result to float before creating a new block for aggregation. This modification ensures that calculations involving nullable integers are handled correctly and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug, allowing calculations with methods like `mean`, `median`, and `var` to work properly when applied to a `DataFrameGroupBy` object that includes columns of type `Int64`.
