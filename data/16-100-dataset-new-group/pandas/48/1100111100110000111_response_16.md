The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the `safe_cast` function, where it tries to cast a float array to an integer array, resulting in a `TypeError` due to non-equivalent data types. This bug causes problems when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the cast from float to integer only happens when the data types are equivalent. This can be achieved by checking if the casted array is equivalent to the original array.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ...
    
    result_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (code for aggregating block)

        if result is not no_result:
            # If the result dtype is the same as the original dtype, cast it
            if result.dtype == block.dtype:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                result_blocks.append(agg_block)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Cannot cast array from dtype '{result.dtype}' to '{block.dtype}'")

    # ...
    return result_blocks, agg_items
```

By adding a check to ensure the equivalent data types, we can prevent the inconsistent dtype casting, which caused the `TypeError` in the previous implementation.

This fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to calling `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype.
