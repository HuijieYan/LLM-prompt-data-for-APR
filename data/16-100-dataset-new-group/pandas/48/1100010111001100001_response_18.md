Suggestion for fixing the bug:
Looking at the function and the failing tests, it seems that the bug is related to the computation and processing of aggregate data. The bug occurs during aggregation operations, specifically when handling numeric-only data. 

In the given function `_cython_agg_blocks`, the issue seems to be related to the aggregation process and the handling of data blocks. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to review the logic for aggregation, particularly when dealing with numeric_only data and performing operations on data blocks. It might be necessary to revisit the implementation and the conditions for numeric_only check within the function.

Below are the suggestions for a corrected version of the function based on the analysis and the failing tests provided:

```python
# Corrected version of the function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[Union[int, str]] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count, downcast=None
        )

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.values

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        agg_items.append(block.items[0])

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version focuses on simplifying the aggregation process by directly using the `grouper.aggregate` method and appropriately handling the result. The provided logic assumes that the `(self.grouper.aggregate)` method is well-implemented and handles aggregation correctly. 

After implementing the corrected logic, it is important to re-run the failing tests to ensure that the corrected function now passes the test cases provided.
