Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue arises when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error states that it is not possible to cast a float64 array to an int64 array according to the safe rule.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It appears that the bug may be related to the casting of values between float and integer data types during aggregation. We need to ensure that the casting is done correctly to avoid the TypeError.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class DataFrameGroupBy:
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # Existing code

        if "mean" in how or "median" in how or "var" in how:
            # Handle mean, median, and var separately
            data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

            if numeric_only:
                data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

            # Perform aggregation
            aggregated = data.aggregate(how, axis=0, min_count=min_count)

            # If the dtype of the result is float64, convert to Int64 if possible
            if aggregated.dtype == "float64":
                try:
                    aggregated = aggregated.astype("Int64")
                except ValueError:
                    pass

            agg_blocks.append(make_block(aggregated.values, placement=new_placement, ndim=2))

        # Remaining code
```

In this corrected version, we specifically handle mean, median, and var functions and ensure that the dtype of the aggregated result is properly handled, attempting to convert to the Int64 type if possible.

By making these changes, we aim to resolve the issue experienced when calling these aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

This fix should address the TypeError involving the incorrect casting of float64 to int64, thus resolving the bug stated in the GitHub issue.
