The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is related to the GitHub issue "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

The potential error locations within the buggy function are in the try-except blocks, where the `NotImplementedError` and `TypeError` exceptions are handled.

The cause of the bug is that the code assumes that all the data blocks are numeric, and when the `groupby` is called on some non-numeric data blocks with `Int64` dtype, it throws a `TypeError`. The code also does not handle the nullable integers correctly in the try-except blocks.

To fix the bug, we need to handle nullable integer data types (Int64) correctly, and make sure that all the operations in the function are performed on numeric types if the `numeric_only` flag is set.

Here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=['number'], copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.values
        if numeric_only and not is_numeric_dtype(result):
            continue
        if isinstance(result, ExtensionArray):
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            result = result.aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, alt=alt)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we handle the numeric_only flag correctly by using `select_dtypes` to filter out non-numeric data blocks. We also ensure that operations are only performed on numeric types, and we handle nullable integers correctly.
