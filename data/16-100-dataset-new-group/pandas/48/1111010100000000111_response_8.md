The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to the handling of the nullable integer data type, 'Int64', when performing aggregation operations. This bug is causing a TypeError when calling the `mean` method after grouping with the 'Int64' dtype.

To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the nullable integer data type and ensure that aggregation operations such as `mean` work as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._try_cast_for_numeric_groupby()

    new_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_locs = []  # Track new location index

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None and result.ndim > 1:
            result = result[:, 0]

        new_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_locs.extend(block.mgr_locs)

    new_index = data.items.take(new_locs)

    return new_blocks, new_index
```

In this corrected version, the conversion for numeric types is handled by the `data._try_cast_for_numeric_groupby()` method. The result of the aggregation is extracted from `self.grouper.aggregate()` and directly added to `new_blocks`. Additionally, the new index is tracked and created with `new_locs` to ensure that it corresponds to the current ordering.

This should fix the bug related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with the 'Int64' dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.
