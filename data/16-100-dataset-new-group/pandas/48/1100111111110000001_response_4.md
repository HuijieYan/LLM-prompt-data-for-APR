It appears that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is encountering a type error when casting float64 to int64. This is happening because the input dtype is 'int64' but the output is 'float64'. 

To address this, we should modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that it only returns 'int64' or 'float64' types as required.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            agg_blocks.append(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This correction ensures that the result is checked for `None` and is only appended to `agg_blocks` if it is not `None`, avoiding the type casting issue.

This should resolve the type error that is occurring with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
