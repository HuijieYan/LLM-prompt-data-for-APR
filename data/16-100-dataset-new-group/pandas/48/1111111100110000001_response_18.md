Looking at the error message, it's clear that the issue is arising from attempting to cast an array of type `float64` to `int64`. This error is raised in the `safe_cast` function when trying to cast the values from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')` according to the rule 'safe'.

The error is originating from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly within the handling of certain operations which lead to attempting to cast a float64 to int64 when applying the median or var operations.

To fix this bug, you would need to ensure that any float64 values are appropriately handled and not attempted to be cast to int64. This might involve adjusting how the type cast is handled, including appropriate condition checks to take the right action based on the type of operation being performed.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... function implementation ...

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None and how != "ohlc":
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]

                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                    # reductions; see GH#28949
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                        split_items.append(locs)
                        split_frames.append(result)
                        continue

                    result_data = result._data.blocks[0]
                    result_values = result_data.values

                    if isinstance(result_values, np.ndarray) and result_values.dtype.kind == 'f':
                        # Check if the results are float type
                        result_values = maybe_convert_objects(result_values)

                    result_values = maybe_downcast_numeric(result_values, block.dtype)
                    result = block.make_block(result_values)

        if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    # ... the rest of the function ...
```

In the corrected version, there's an additional check to handle float values appropriately before attempting to apply the aggregate functions. This will prevent the TypeError caused by attempting to cast float64 to int64.
