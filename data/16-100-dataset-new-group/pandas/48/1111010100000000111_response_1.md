## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with the GitHub issue

The provided GitHub issue reports a bug where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The issue is reported for pandas version 1.0.1 and Python 3.7.3. The error does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but it also occurs with median and std. This bug is likely related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is responsible for performing aggregations on the grouped data.

## Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that could lead to the reported issue include handling the nullable integer data type (Int64), the way aggregation is performed for different functions like mean, median, and std, and how the result is processed and returned.

## Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function and GitHub Issue information

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles nullable integer data type (Int64) when performing aggregations like mean, median, and std. It is likely that the function doesn't handle the Int64 dtype correctly during aggregation, leading to the reported TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The bug may also be related to the processing and return of the result for certain aggregation functions.

## Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function will need modifications to correctly handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) during aggregation. Additionally, the function should be thoroughly checked for any issues related to the processing and return of the result for different aggregation functions like mean, median, and std.

## The corrected version of the function

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_items = data.items
    agg_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block, how)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise
            result = alt(block)
        # handle Int64 dtype for aggregation
        result, _ = maybe_convert_objects(result, data.items, copy=False)
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
        agg_blocks.append(make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs, ndim=1))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected version of the function includes handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) during aggregation and post-processing the result for different aggregation functions. This should address the reported bug where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.
