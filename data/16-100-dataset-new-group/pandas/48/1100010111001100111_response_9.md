The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to the `result` variable. It seems that the `result` variable isn't being properly handled after the exception is caught, leading to incorrect behavior when creating the `agg_block`. Let's address this issue by modifying the error handling and the process for creating the `agg_block`.

We'll revise the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to catch the `NotImplementedError` exception and handle it properly to create the `agg_block`. Additionally, we'll adjust the behavior when an `agg_block` is a DataFrame split into multiple blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous code)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous code)

        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                        # handle split DataFrame blocks
                        split_items.append(locs)
                        split_frames.append(result)
                        continue
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not no_result:
            # cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # handle ExtensionBlock and reshape if necessary
                if result.ndim == 1:
                    try:
                        result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                            result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                        )
                    except ValueError:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In this corrected version, we handle the `NotImplementedError` by attempting the alternative method and properly processing the result. Additionally, we handle the case when the `agg_block` is a DataFrame split into multiple blocks.

This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug. It handles `mean`, `median`, and `var` operations on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype, addressing the TypeError that was previously occurring.
