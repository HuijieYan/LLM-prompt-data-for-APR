Looking at the error messages, we see that the problem lies in the attempt to convert float64 to int64 using `astype`. The error is raised because the method cannot convert the float values to int64 without loss of precision.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to safely handle the conversion from float dtype to int dtype. We could use `maybe_convert_objects` method from pandas.core.dtypes.cast to safely cast the values to the dtype if they are equivalent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        # New method converts objects safely
        data = maybe_convert_objects(data, copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
        
        # rest of the function body
```

In this fixed version, we've used the `maybe_convert_objects` method to safely cast the data to the appropriate Dtype, so it can handle the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64, avoiding the TypeError.

Remember to test the corrected version with the failing test data to confirm the solution is successful.
