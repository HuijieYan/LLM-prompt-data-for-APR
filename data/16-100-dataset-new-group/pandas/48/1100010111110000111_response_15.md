The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the calculation and aggregation of numeric data, specifically when dealing with nullable integer data (`Int64`). This bug leads to a TypeError when attempting to cast an array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'.

The root cause of the bug is a failure to correctly handle nullable integer data within the `cython_agg_blocks` function. This causes the incorrect casting of float data to the existing nullable integer data type, leading to a TypeError. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the Nullable Integer dtype is handled correctly, including any necessary type conversion before aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # New code to handle Int64 datatype
    data = self._obj._ensure_valid_index(data)
    
    if data.dtype is not None and pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(data.dtype):
        data = data.astype(float)
        
    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data(copy=False)  # Use the internal _get_numeric_data function

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In this corrected version, we introduced a check to ensure that the data is being accurately converted to float data type before performing any aggregation operations. This should resolve the casting errors and the TypeError reported in the original issue on GitHub.
