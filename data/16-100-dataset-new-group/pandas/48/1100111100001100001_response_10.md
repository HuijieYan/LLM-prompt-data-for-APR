The bug in the given code seems to be that the `agg_block` variable, which is used to create a new block for the aggregated result, is being appended to `agg_blocks` regardless of whether it contains a valid result. This is causing issues when trying to fetch the results from this list.

The function first defines `agg_blocks` as an empty list to hold the aggregated blocks. Then, inside the loop that iterates over the data blocks, it creates `agg_block` for each block, irrespective of whether a valid result is obtained. This `agg_block` is then appended to the `agg_blocks` list unconditionally for each block.

To fix the bug, we should only append `agg_block` to `agg_blocks` if it contains a valid result. Additionally, the `new_items` list is used to maintain information about the location indices of the blocks. We should ensure that the `new_items` list and the `agg_blocks` list are populated consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function remain intact)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... (other parts of the function remain intact)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # ... (other parts of the function remain intact)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain intact)
```

In this corrected version, we only append `agg_block` to `agg_blocks` if a valid result is obtained. This ensures that `agg_blocks` contains only valid aggregated blocks, and the `new_items` list is consistent with the aggregation results.

This fix should address the bug in the original function.
