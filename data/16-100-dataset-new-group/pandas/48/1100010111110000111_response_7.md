The issue in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely leading to the TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. This issue is also reflected in the GitHub report titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

The cause of the bug is due to the unsafe cast of values to the dtype (`int64`) instead of the expected dtype (`float64`) when applying the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions to a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. 

To fix this bug:
1. We need to identify the data type of the result of the aggregation for `mean`, `median`, and `var` operations.
2. If the result is numeric, cast the values to the appropriate dtype.

Based on the analysis, here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing implementation
    
    # ... (rest of the code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        
        # ... (rest of the code)

        if result is not no_result:

            if how in ['mean', 'median', 'var']:
                result = result.astype('float64')  # Cast to float64 for mean, median, and var

            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                # (1, N) case can occur if block.values was Categorical
                #  and result is ndarray[object]
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    # Cast back if feasible
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    # reshape to be valid for non-Extension Block
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

This correction ensures that the result obtained after the operations `mean`, `median`, or `var` is appropriately cast to the expected datatype ('float64').

After implementing this correction in the `pandas` codebase and running the failing test, the bug should be fixed.
