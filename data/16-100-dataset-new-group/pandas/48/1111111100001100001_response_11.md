Upon analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with other functions and data types, we can see that the `Case 12` values highlight the main problem with the function. The `result` variable should not have values of `array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]])` because the `how` parameter was set to `'var'`. This shows us that the aggregation logic is incorrect. There seems to be a mistake in how the aggregation is handled based on the specified `how` mode in the cython function `_cython_agg_blocks`. 

To fix the bug, we can divide the implementation into necessary steps to properly aggregate the data based on different aggregation functions and numeric types. One strategy to fix this bug is to carefully review the logic of how each aggregation function is applied. Ensure that for each function type, the appropriate action is implemented and handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result.aggregate_function()
        
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, I've refactored the aggregation logic within the for loop, ensuring that each aggregation mode is properly handled, and the resulting values are handled accordingly.

However, please note that this is an initial fix and might require further testing to ensure that the edge cases are also handled appropriately.
