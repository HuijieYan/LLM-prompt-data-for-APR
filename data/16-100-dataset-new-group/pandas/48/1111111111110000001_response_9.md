The cause of the bug is that the `safe_cast` function is trying to cast an array from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')` following the rule 'safe', which is causing a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct data types are being used for the conversion, and that any operation that is intended to convert float to int is handled carefully.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ...
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... (other variable declarations)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            # ... (other exception handling logic)
        finally:
            if result is not no_result:
                # Perform conversions based on the data types
                values_dtype = block.values.dtype
                if result.dtype.kind == 'f' and values_dtype.kind == 'i':
                    result = result.astype(values_dtype, casting='safe', copy=False)
                elif result.dtype.kind != values_dtype.kind:
                    result = result.astype(values_dtype, copy=False)

                # create an aggregated block from the result
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    # ... (post-processing logic)
```

In the corrected version, after obtaining the result, it checks the data types of the result and the original block values. If the result is floating-point and the original block values are integers, it performs a direct cast of the result back to the integer data type using `astype`. For other cases, it performs a cast to match the original data type with `astype`.

By ensuring the correct data type conversion, this fix aims to resolve the TypeError caused by the inappropriate casting of array data types.
