### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the GitHub issue

The GitHub issue describes a problem where calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. This suggests that the bug is related to the aggregation process in pandas, specifically when working with Int64 dtype.

The `DataFrameGroupBy` class contains the buggy `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is involved in the data aggregation process when using functions like `mean`. It also calls the internal function `_get_data_to_aggregate` to retrieve the data to be aggregated.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function

The potential error locations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function could be related to the handling of data with the Int64 dtype and the aggregation process. It's possible that the bug is occurring when trying to aggregate Int64 data, leading to a TypeError.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

Based on the GitHub issue and the source code of the function, the bug seems to be related to the handling of Int64 data during the aggregation process. It appears that the function is not properly handling the aggregation of Int64 data, leading to a TypeError instead of the expected result. This could be an issue with the data conversion or handling within the function.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should be modified to properly handle the aggregation of Int64 data. This may involve checking for the specific dtype and ensuring that the aggregation operation is compatible with Int64 data. Additionally, the data conversion and handling process within the function should be reviewed to identify and resolve any potential issues that could lead to a TypeError.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

Based on the GitHub issue and the identified potential error locations, the following corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Retrieve the data to be aggregated
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Filter numeric data if numeric_only is True
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Perform the aggregation based on the specified method
    try:
        # Check if the data type is Int64 and handle aggregation accordingly
        if data.blocks[0].dtype == 'Int64':
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                data.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only
            )
        else:
            # For other data types, perform the aggregation as before
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                data.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

    except NotImplementedError:
        # Handle the NotImplementedError if needed
        # ...
        
    # Continue with the rest of the function as before
    # ...
```

This corrected version includes an additional check for the data type (Int64) and custom handling of the aggregation process based on the specific data type. This modification should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub problem description.
