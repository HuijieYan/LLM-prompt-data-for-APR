To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `aggregate` method works properly for nullable integer data types in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The issue posted on GitHub highlights the problem when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`. The expected output should be a mean calculation grouped by the specified column(s).

Looking at the failing test cases and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to calculating aggregate statistics for columns of nullable integer type.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types properly. Specifically, we need to ensure that the grouping and aggregation operations are performed correctly for the `Int64` dtype or nullable integer type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except TypeError:
            # Handle TypeError for unsupported aggregation operations
            if alt is not None:
                # Call the alternate function when specified
                result = block.agg(alt)
            else:
                # Handle the case when alt is not specified
                raise NotImplementedError(
                    f"Aggregation method '{how}' is not supported for the input"
                )

        # Create a new block with the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # combined_agg method to concatenate the results and items for the GroupBy object
    concat_result = combine_concat_result(
        agg_blocks, self.group_info, axis=self.axis or 0
    )

    return concat_result
```

In this corrected version, we have added logic to properly handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This includes catching and handling TypeError for unsupported aggregation operations, accommodating alternate aggregation methods when specified, and creating a new block with the aggregated result.

By addressing the specific needs of nullable integer data types in the aggregation process, we aim to resolve the issue of calculating aggregate statistics for columns with the `Int64` dtype while working with `DataFrameGroupBy` objects containing nullable integer data.

After implementing this corrected version, the `cython_agg_blocks` function should handle the aggregation operations for nullable integer data types correctly and pass the failing test cases presented earlier.
