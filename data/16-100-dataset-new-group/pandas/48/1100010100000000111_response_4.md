The bug in the provided function is likely causing the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue is related to the handling of nullable integer data types, which is likely leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be updated to handle nullable integer data types correctly when aggregating data. Specifically, the condition for checking the data type and the handling of nullable integer data types should be updated.

The corrected version for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is as follows:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes(copy=True)  # Use convert_dtypes to ensure correct type conversion

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rest of the code for cleaning up split blocks and resetting locs in the blocks remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version should address the issue reported on GitHub by handling nullable integer data types correctly when aggregating data.
