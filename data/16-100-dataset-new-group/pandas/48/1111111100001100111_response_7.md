After analyzing the buggy function and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the bug is related to handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) in the `groupby` and aggregation operation. 

The bug occurs when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with the nullable integer (Int64) dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The issue arises because of how the ` _cython_agg_blocks` function handles the aggregation under this scenario.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer (Int64) dtype appropriately and prevent the TypeError from occurring when calling `mean` in the specific use case described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to resolve the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Rest of the function remains the same

    if (
        numeric_only
        and how in ["mean", "median", "var", "std"]
        and isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype)
    ):
        method = {
            "mean": block.values.mean(),
            "median": block.values.median(),
            "var": block.values.var(),
            "std": block.values.std(),
        }.get(how)
        
        if method is not None:
            result = method
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check if `numeric_only` is `True`, the `how` parameter is one of "mean", "median", "var", "std", and the dtype of the block is `pd.Int64Dtype`. If so, we calculate the aggregation method using the nullable integer values and avoid the TypeError.

With this fix, the issue reported in the GitHub thread should be resolved.

Please note that this fix assumes the rest of the function logic remains the same, and the suggested code changes only focus on handling nullable integer data type during aggregation.
