The issue describes a problem where calling the `mean()` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The issue mentions that the error occurs when calling `mean()` after grouping, and also occurs with other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`.

The issue also provides an example of the expected output, the output of `pd.show_versions()`, and the system and package configuration details.

Based on the described problem and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that there is an issue with the aggregation operation on nullable integer dtype (`Int64`).

The problem is related to the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function performs aggregation and manages the data in the BlockManager. The specific code path responsible for performing aggregation on nullable integer data might be causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, you would need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle the nullable integer dtype appropriately during data aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes(infer_objects=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    indexer = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        result = block._groupby_and_aggregate(how, numeric_only, min_count, self.grouper, alt)

        if result.is_list_like:
            for res, loc in zip(result, locs):
                agg_blocks.append(res)
                indexer.extend([loc] * res.shape[1])
        else:
            agg_blocks.append(result)
            indexer.extend([locs] * result.shape[1])

    return agg_blocks, parent_axis.labels.take(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we handle nullable integer dtype appropriately by converting the data types using the `convert_dtypes` method and calling the `_groupby_and_aggregate` method to perform the aggregation operation.

After applying this fix, the `DataFrameGroupBy` object should correctly handle the aggregation of nullable integer dtype and not result in a TypeError when calling the `mean()` or other aggregation functions.

This fix is based on the assumption that the issue in the GitHub report is caused by the behavior of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, which seems to be responsible for the erroneous aggregation behavior. If the problem is more complex and the bug is caused by a different function or behavior, further investigation and modification may be necessary.
