## Buggy Function Analysis

The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is designed to process aggregation of data, but it seems to have issues when working with nullable integer data types. This is consistent with the GitHub issue that states that calling `mean` after grouping results in a `TypeError` when using nullable integer data type.

Looking at the cases of runtime inputs and outputs, we can see that the issue occurs with numeric data that has nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype.

The `numeric_only` parameter is set to `True`, which indicates that only numeric data should be included in the aggregation. However, when the data contains nullable integers, it seems that this is causing a `TypeError`.

The `result` variable, which holds the aggregated data, is also being processed to handle nullable integer data, but it's unclear whether this is being handled correctly.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug seems to be related to how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function processes numeric data with nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype. It seems that the function may not be handling nullable integer data correctly, leading to the `TypeError` observed in the failing test cases and the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug

The bug may be related to how the function processes nullable integer data. The fix may involve handling nullable integer data types properly, avoiding any operations that could cause a `TypeError` when working with nullable integer data.

Additionally, the function may need to be modified to account for the possible presence of nullable integer data when handling numeric-only aggregations.

## Corrected Version of the Function

```python
# Assuming that the problematic operations are related to handling nullable integer data, 
# the corrected version of the function could include explicit checks for nullable integer data and appropriate handling.

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.dropna().get_numeric_data(copy=False)  # Ensure data contains only numeric and non-null values
        for block in data.blocks:
            if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
                try:
                    block = block.astype('float')  # Cast Int64 blocks to float to avoid potential issues
                except:
                    # Handle exceptions related to converting to float, if necessary
                    pass

    # Existing logic...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for nullable integer (`Int64`) data and convert it to standard numeric types if needed, ensuring that the nullable nature of the data is handled properly. Additionally, we ensure that the remaining data contains only numeric and non-null values when the `numeric_only` flag is set. This is just one possible approach to fixing the bug.

Further testing and validation would be needed to confirm the effectiveness of this correction. Additionally, for a complete and robust solution, input validations, exception handling, and comprehensive testing should be considered.
