The given buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class within the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file fails to properly handle the `agg_blocks` and `split_frames`, leading to a DataError in cases where there are no numeric types to aggregate. This function is related to the `groups` class which is using `groups.agg` to apply the aggregate function to the DataFrame.   

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct data is being aggregated and that exceptions are handled appropriately.

Here is a possible fix for the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])  # Select only numeric columns

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    deleted_items: List[int] = []
    split_items: List[int] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.extend(block.mgr_locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj.reindex(data.items[block.mgr_locs], axis=1)
            s = obj.groupby(self.grouper.axis)
            result = s.agg(alt)

            if result._data.shape[1] > 1:  # Check for split blocks
                split_items.extend(block.mgr_locs)
                continue

            result = Block(result._data.blocks[0].values, block.mgr_locs, ndim=2, axis=1)

        agg_blocks.append(result)
        new_items.extend(block.mgr_locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Clean up the mixed-type blocks
    if split_items:
        temp_blocks = [data.blocks[i] for i in split_items]
        new_items, temp_agg_blocks = _clean_and_aggregate_temp_blocks(split_items, temp_blocks, alt)
        agg_blocks.extend(temp_agg_blocks)

    # Rearrange the aggregated blocks to maintain sequence
    indexer = np.sort(new_items)
    new_items = data.items.take(indexer)
    agg_blocks = _rearrange_agg_blocks(new_items, data, indexer, agg_blocks)

    return agg_blocks, new_items
```

This fix includes several changes:
1. Use `data.select_dtypes` to select only numeric columns if `numeric_only` is True.
2. Update the exception handling based on whether an alternate function `alt` is provided.
3. Check for split blocks and handle them separately, then clean and aggregate the remaining blocks.
4. Rearrange the aggregated blocks to maintain sequence.

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should pass the failing test.
