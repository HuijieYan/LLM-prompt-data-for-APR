Based on the error messages from the failing test and the GitHub issue, it appears that there's an issue with safely casting non-equivalent data types during the aggregation process for DataFrameGroupBy. The DataFrame contains columns with dtype 'Int64', which is the new nullable integer data type in pandas. When attempting to call mean(), median(), var(), or other aggregation functions on the groupby object, a TypeError is raised due to the incorrect casting of data types.

Given this information, the bug seems to be related to the casting of float64 data to int64 during the aggregation process. The error occurs when calling the aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object, specifically mean(), median(), or var().

To fix this bug, a strategy could be to modify the aggregation process in the _cython_agg_blocks() function to explicitly handle the nullable integer data type when performing calculations. This might involve checking the data type of each column and handling the casting of data types appropriately to avoid attempts to cast non-equivalent data types.

Here's a corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks() function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                #  reductions; see GH#28949
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    # We've split an object block! Everything we've assumed
                    # about a single block input returning a single block output
                    # is a lie. To keep the code-path for the typical non-split case
                    # clean, we choose to clean up this mess later on.
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                # (1, N) case can occur if block.values was Categorical
                #  and result is ndarray[object]
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1

                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    # reshape to be valid for non-Extension Block
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, special handling is added to ensure that nullable integer data is appropriately cast to avoid non-equivalent casting and subsequent TypeError during the aggregation process. This should address the issue and make the aggregation functions work properly when called on the groupby object.

Please note that applying this fix will need testing to ensure the corrected behavior for different aggregation functions on DataFrameGroupBy.
