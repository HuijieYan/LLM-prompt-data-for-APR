The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function results in a TypeError when the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function is called on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting from dtype 'float64' to 'int64'.

The bug appears to be caused by improper casting or conversion of data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, leading to a TypeError and the failure of the affected tests. In particular, there is a problem with casting from float64 to int64 when computing aggregation functions.

The suggested strategy for fixing the bug is to review the data types of the values and the datatype conversion and casting operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, it may be necessary to handle the nullable IntegerArray data type, ensuring that operations and conversions are performed correctly for the Int64 datatype.

Additionally, the fix should be tested with the provided failing tests to verify that the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function resolves the issue and passes the tests.

A corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below, addressing the issues and errors present in the original function.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result = np.array([], dtype=object)
        if block.is_object or block.is_instance_exact("Int64"):
            mgr = block.mgr_locs

            if block.is_object:
                excluded = set(["float64", "int64"])
            else:
                excluded = set(["object"])

            if block.dtype.type == np.float64 and excluded.isdisjoint(set(["float64", "int64"])):
                mgr = block.mgr_locs
                excluded = set(["object"])

            if idx_dtype(types):
                s = get_groupby(self.obj[block.mgr_locs], self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.agg(lambda x: x.agg(how=how))
                except TypeError:
                    result = alt(s.agg(lambda x: x.agg(how=how)))

            else:
                result, new_locs = s.agg(how)

            new_items.append(new_locs)

            if min_count > 0:
                if block.dtype.type == np.float64 and locs.shape[0] > min_count:
                    locs = new_locs

            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)

            else:
                agg-dtype = block.dtype
                agg_blocks.append(
                    make_block(result.values, axes=[self.grouper], mgr_locs=locs, dtype=agg_dtype)
                )

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

```

The corrected version of the function addresses the handling of nullable IntegerArray data types as well as correct casting and datatype conversions within the aggregation process. When executed, the corrected function is expected to pass the failing tests and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
