### Bug Analysis
The bug lies in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function attempts to handle aggregation of blocks within a group, but it encounters errors when trying to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`.

The failing test is due to the incorrect casting of numpy arrays from `float64` to `int64` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This leads to a `TypeError` when trying to cast non-equivalent float values to integers.

The bug has been reported on GitHub in issue #[32219](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/32219). The issue describes the problem of calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with DataFrame columns of type 'Int64' resulting in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Location
The bug is likely occurring within the section of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where it performs the casting of values from `float64` to `int64`. Specifically, the error occurs during the `safe_cast` function, which attempts to safely cast the values but encounters the `TypeError`.

### Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is an incorrect attempt to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` values to `int64` within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The safe casting mechanism fails when trying to convert non-equivalent float values to integers, resulting in the `TypeError`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the code to handle the aggregation of 'Int64' data type columns correctly, without encountering the TypeError related to casting from 'float64' to 'int64'. This likely involves revising the casting approach, validating the dtype conversions, and ensuring that the resulting dtype is appropriate for the aggregated data.

### Corrected Version
```python
# Assuming that the root cause of the bug has been identified and the fix is to modify the _cython_agg_blocks function to handle 'Int64' data types correctly

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing implementation)

  for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing implementation)

        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # Error handling for non-equivalent float values
        result = result.astype(np.float64)  # cast the result to float64
        result = result.astype(np.int64, errors='ignore')  # cast the result to int64, ignore errors

        # ... (remaining implementation)
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This is a simplified correction, and it focuses specifically on addressing the dtype conversion issue within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Additionally, further validation and handling would be required to ensure that the correct data types are used for aggregated values.
