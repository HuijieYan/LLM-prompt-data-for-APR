The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` takes several arguments and returns a tuple. It appears that the error message arises from type casting issues when trying to convert array values from one dtype to another. Specifically, the line `return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)` triggers a `TypeError` because it's trying to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe', which is not possible.

To fix the bug, modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to appropriately handle the type casting issues, ensuring that values are cast between dtypes correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    # We've split an object block! Everything we've assumed
                    # about a single block input returning a single block output
                    # is a lie. To keep the code-path for the typical non-split case
                    # clean, we choose to clean up this mess later on.
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue
                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        # Update dtype handling and type casting
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            
            # Updated this block to downcast to original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)

            # Updated this block to handle safe type casting from float to int
            try:
                result = result.astype(block.dtype, casting="unsafe")
            except (TypeError, ValueError):
                pass
            
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged
            # ... 
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...          
```

The changes to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function focus on handling the type casting issues that were causing the `TypeError`. Specifically, we've added `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` method to downcast the results back to the original data type, and the `astype` method to cast the results with `casting="unsafe"`.

Applying these changes should resolve the type casting issues and ensure that the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` functions performs as expected without raising `TypeError` due to incorrect type casting.
