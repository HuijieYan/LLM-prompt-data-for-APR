The problem seems to be that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not correctly handling `alt` for the `mean` and `median` functions. The test cases consistently produce incorrect output, where the expected result is not equal to the actual result.

The output of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function consists of the following:

1. `agg_blocks`: A list of blocks containing the aggregated values.
2. `new_items`: A list of new item locations.
3. `deleted_items`: A list of item locations to be deleted.
4. `split_items`: A list of split items.
5. `split_frames`: A list of split frames.
6. `agg_items`: The aggregated items.

To correct the buggy function, we need to ensure that the `alt` value, which is used when an operation is not implemented, is assigned correctly and calculated accurately.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=0, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("The operation is not supported.")
            else:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=0)

        if result is not no_result:
            # See if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `try-except` block is used to handle cases where an operation is not implemented. If an alternate function is not provided (`alt is None`), it raises a `NotImplementedError`. Otherwise, it uses the alternate function to get the result.
2. Instead of creating separate lists for different types of items, a single loop processes all blocks.
3. If the `result` is not equal to `no_result`, the appropriate block is created and added to the aggregated blocks along with its location.

The corrected version of the function should now accurately handle the aggregation and provide correct results to pass the failing test cases.
