The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` fails to aggregate the data when the input is of an object dtype. This issue causes the failing tests in the `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py` file. The root cause is that when the function tries to perform aggregation on non-numeric data, it falls back to a different computation that is not handling the nullable integer data correctly.

The suggested fix for the bug would be to handle the nullable integer data separately. In the case where the data is not of a numeric type and the function needs to calculate the variance, the `alt` argument in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should use the `.var()` method with `skipna=True`, as the regular variance function can handle nullable integers without issue.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous code)
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # Call the method depending on the operation requested
            if how == 'var' and isinstance(block, (ExtensionBlock, IntExtensionBlock)):
                result = block.var(skipna=True,ddof=0)
            else:
                result = alt(block, axis=self.axis)

            # rest of the code ...
```

By modifying the section in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that falls back to alternative methods when non-numeric data is encountered, we are separating the logic for handling nullable integers. The `result` variable is calculated based on the operation required. If the operation is "var", it uses the `.var()` method, and in all other cases, it falls back to the alternative computation.

With this change, the function will correctly handle nullable integer data when performing the variance aggregation, and should pass the failing tests in `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py`.
