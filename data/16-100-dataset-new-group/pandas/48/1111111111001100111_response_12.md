The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely due to an inconsistency between the expected and actual output of the function, causing a `TypeError`. This is consistent with the GitHub issue that reports a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype. The `mean` function is one of the affected operations, alongside `median` and `std`.

The function uses the `BlockManager` to perform aggregation on numeric data. However, due to the dtype incompatibility issue reported in the GitHub issue, the function likely encounters a type inconsistency when trying to perform the aggregation. This leads to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the nullable integer dtype (Int64) appropriately to avoid the `TypeError` when performing the aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

The corrected function should handle the nullable integer dtype appropriately, ensuring that the aggregation methods work seamlessly with the `Int64` dtype.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block._agg(how, min_count=min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates through each block in the `BlockManager` and applies the appropriate aggregation method based on the data type handled by each block.

This corrected approach should resolve the dtype inconsistency issue and ensure seamless operation of aggregation methods with the `Int64` dtype, fixing the bug and addressing the GitHub issue.
