## Issue Analysis
The issue is that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

## Potential Error Locations
The error may be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that is being used for grouping operations. The error message indicates that the function is attempting to cast an array from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')` according to the rule 'safe', but this casting is resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely related to the safe casting of `float64` to `int64`. The error message shows that the safe casting is failing, indicating that the function is incorrectly trying to cast float values to integer values, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that safe casting is handled properly for numeric operations on `Int64` data type. This may involve checking the data type of the values being operated on and handling the casting accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
```python
# The relative path of the source file: pandas/core/groupby/generic.py

# corrected version of the function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # ... existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            if block.dtype == "Int64" and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating):
                result = result.astype("Int64")  # cast floats to Int64
            elif block.dtype == "Int64" and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.integer):
                result = result.astype("Int64")  # cast integers to Int64
            elif block.dtype == "Int64":
                raise DataError(f"Cannot safely cast {result.dtype} to {block.dtype}")
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # ... existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version of the function, additional handling is added to the block casting process to safely cast numeric values to the `Int64` data type. This helps ensure that any casting operations are performed correctly and safely.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and pass the failing test.
