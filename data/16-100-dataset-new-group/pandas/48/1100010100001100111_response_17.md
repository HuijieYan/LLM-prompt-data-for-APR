The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be encountering an issue when performing certain aggregations on nullable integer data types. The GitHub issue describes a similar problem when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with nullable integer data type, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Based on the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug may be related to the handling of nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The specific aggregation methods such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` are causing the `TypeError` when applied to nullable integer data types.

To fix the bug, the function should handle nullable integer data types appropriately when performing the aggregations. This may involve using conditional checks to handle nullable values and their aggregations more robustly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that aims to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle aggregation for specific functions when using nullable integers
            if block.values.dtype.type == pd.Int64Dtype.type:
                # Convert nullable integers to regular integers for aggregation
                converted_values = block.values.astype('Int64').fillna(0)
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    converted_values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            else:
                # If the block values are not nullable integers, raise the error
                raise

        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
        # (no other changes are necessary, the focus is on handling nullable integers)

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same as the original implementation)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we have added specific handling for nullable integer data types within the loop where the aggregations are performed. This includes converting nullable integers to regular integers for aggregation to prevent `TypeError` and other errors.

This approach aims to resolve the bug by ensuring that all required data type conversions and handling are performed appropriately within the function. Further testing should be done to ensure that the corrected function effectively resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
