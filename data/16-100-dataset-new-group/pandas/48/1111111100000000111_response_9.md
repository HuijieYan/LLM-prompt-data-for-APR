The bug is caused by calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError. The issue is related to the new nullable integer data type, and it occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, and `std`. 

The cause of the bug in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` is that it is not handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) properly when performing aggregation operations such as calculating `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to add a check within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer type specifically and ensure proper aggregation for this data type.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None and (
                (block.is_numeric and block.dtype.name.startswith('Int'))
                or block.is_bool
            ):
                # Use alternate method for nullable integer and boolean types
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
        if result is no_result:
            # Handle other cases with the original method
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version includes a check for nullable integer (Int64) and boolean types within the loop, using the alternate method (if provided) for these specific data types when aggregating. This should resolve the TypeError issue described in the GitHub bug report.
