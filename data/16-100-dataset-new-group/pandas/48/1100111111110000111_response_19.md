Based on the failing tests and the error message, the issue seems to be related to a TypeError when trying to cast from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' for nullable integer values.

One strategy to fix this bug is to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to check for nullable integer dtype and handle the casting appropriately. Specifically, when working with nullable integer values, the aggregation should take into account the potential presence of NA values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code here)

    if data._is_view and numeric_only and isinstance(data.axis, ABCMultiIndex):
        raise SpecificationError("Cannot generate out index with duplicates")

    # Handle nullable integers specially
    if ("Int" in str(data.dtypes) or "UInt" in str(data.dtypes)) and numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=['floating', 'integer'])
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # ... (remaining code here)
```

By adding the check for `"Int"` or `"UInt"` in the data types, the function specifically handles the special case of nullable integers by only selecting the nullable integer, floating, and integer dtype columns. This should prevent the TypeError related to casting from 'float64' to 'int64' for nullable integer values.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub.
