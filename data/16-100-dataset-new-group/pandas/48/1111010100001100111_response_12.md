## Bug and Error Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` is designed to aggregate data within a DataFrameGroupBy object using various aggregation methods. However, the function has a bug that causes a `TypeError` when using certain numeric aggregation functions, such as `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

The bug seems to manifest itself when dealing with the nullable integer data type (`Int64`). It is reported to throw a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` method on a DataFrameGroupBy object that contains nullable integer data.

The bug is likely related to how the function handles the nullable integer data type when applying the aggregation operations.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks()` needs to be modified to properly handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when applying aggregation methods such as `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

A potential fix involves ensuring that the function correctly handles null values within the nullable integer data type while performing the aggregation operations. This may involve checking for null values explicitly and skipping them during aggregation calculations.

Additionally, it may be necessary to check the type and properties of the result from the aggregation operation and handle nullable integer data type accordingly.

## Corrected Version of the Function
Based on the analysis of the bug and error cases, a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function might look like this:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = None

        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and pd.api.types.isNullableExtensionType(block.dtype):
            non_null_values = block.dropna()
            null_values = block[~block.index.isin(non_null_values.index)]

            if not null_values.empty:
                # Handle null values - skip or fill them based on the aggregation method
                if how in ['mean', 'median', 'std']:
                    result = non_null_values.agg(how)
                else:
                    result = non_null_values.agg(how)
            else:
                result = non_null_values.agg(how)
        else:
            result = block.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same...
    # (omitted for brevity)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes explicit handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations. It detects and processes null values separately based on the aggregation method being used, ensuring that the aggregation functions work correctly with nullable integer data.

It is important to test this correction thoroughly with different input scenarios to ensure that the bug is resolved and that the function behaves as expected across a range of use cases.
