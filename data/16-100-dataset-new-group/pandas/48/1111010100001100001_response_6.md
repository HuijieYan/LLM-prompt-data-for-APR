The bug may be due to improper aggregation or handling of block values. It seems that the function is not performing the aggregation correctly. Additionally, there are no error checks in place, which may lead to unexpected behavior for certain inputs.

To fix the bug, we should carefully review the aggregation and data manipulation logic. Furthermore, we should add error checks to handle edge cases and unexpected scenarios properly.
We also need to ensure that the data type conversions and array manipulations are being performed accurately.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._try_cast_for_aggregation()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        result, _ = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
``` 

In the corrected version, we have improved the logic for aggregation and data handling. We also added error checks and performed proper datatype conversions and array manipulations.
