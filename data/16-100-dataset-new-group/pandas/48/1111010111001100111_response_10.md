## Issue analysis
The GitHub issue report describes a problem with calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This issue occurs in various cases, such as after grouping or taking a single column to give a `SeriesGroupBy`. The error also occurs with `median` and `std` but not with `min`, `max`, or `first`.

The expected output is a DataFrame with the grouped mean values, but the actual output is a TypeError.

The versions of pandas and other relevant libraries are also provided to give context to the environment in which the bug is occurring.

## Potential error locations within the buggy function
Based on the provided information and the failing test cases, the issue is likely related to the handling of nullable integer dtypes within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the DataFrameGroupBy class.

## Cause of the bug
The cause of the bug might be related to the way the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles the grouping and aggregation of numeric data when dealing with nullable integer data types. This likely leads to a TypeError when attempting to calculate the mean, median, or standard deviation.

## Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can potentially be fixed by adjusting the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer dtypes during grouping and aggregation. Specifically, the code should be modified to handle nullable integer dtypes in a way that allows for proper calculation of mean, median, and standard deviation.

## Corrected version of the buggy function
```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    g = self.grouper

    if how in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
        result, _ = data.aggregate(how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
    else:
        result, _ = g.aggregate(data)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, I've made the following changes:
1. Added a check for `numeric_only` and converted the data to dtypes using the `convert_dtypes()` function to handle nullable integer dtypes.
2. Instead of catching potential errors, explicitly perform the aggregation using the `aggregate` method, specifically handling scenarios where the `how` parameter is "mean", "median", or "var".

This corrected version should properly handle nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
