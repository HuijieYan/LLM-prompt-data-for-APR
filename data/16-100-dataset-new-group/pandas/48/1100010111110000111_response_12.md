Here are the potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. The function may not be handling nullable integer data properly.
2. There could be an issue with converting float64 to int64.

The cause of the bug is that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is not properly handling nullable integer data when applying aggregate functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` resulting in a TypeError when trying to cast float64 to int64.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data correctly when it encounters aggregate functions that require conversion from float64 to int64.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Placeholder for potential imports not provided

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # original code omitted for brevity

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if isinstance(data, DataFrame) and data.dtypes.apply(lambda x: x.kind in "iu").all():
        result = data._cython_agg_general(how, alt=alt, min_count=min_count)
    else:
        result = data.aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

    return result
```

In this corrected version, we no longer use a direct loop over the blocks, and instead apply the aggregation directly to the entire `data` object after ensuring that all the columns have 'integer' or 'unsigned integer' data type.

This correction should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data correctly when applying aggregate functions, resulting in no TypeError when converting float64 to int64.

Please note that the complete function may have more dependencies and should be tested thoroughly after the modification.
