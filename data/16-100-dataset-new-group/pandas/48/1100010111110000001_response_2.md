The issue seems to be related to the incorrect cast of values from float64 to int64 in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error messages indicate that the `safe_cast` function is attempting to cast an array of dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe', which is not possible.

The issue is likely due to the fact that the code is trying to cast float64 to int64 when it should be handling nullable integers (`Int64`) instead. It seems that the data should be treated as floats, not integers.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the type casting logic to ensure that the data is treated as floats, which aligns with the actual data type. We can also modify the logic to handle nullable integers in a more appropriate way.

The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is as follows:

```python
# corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (rest of the original code)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # The correction starts here
            # The code now appropriately multivalued cells without breaking integer semantics and no-cast rule
            if isinstance(result, tetnse):
                res = result.to_numpy(dtype=np.float64)
                res = np.nanmean(res, axis=1, keepdims=True) if how == "mean" else np.nanmedian(res, axis=1, keepdims=True)
                agg_block = block.make_block(res, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by ensuring that the result, which may be inferred dtype from the input, is treated as a float type, and aggregating the values correctly without breaking the integer semantics.
