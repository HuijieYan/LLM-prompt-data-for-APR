The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely causing the TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue is related to the handling of nullable integer data type when aggregating.

The cause of the bug is likely that the function is not handling the new nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `std`. This is likely due to the function not properly checking for the nullable properties of the Int64 data type, which leads to encountering a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be updated to properly handle the new nullable integer data type when performing aggregation. Additionally, the function should check for the nullable properties of the Int64 data type and handle the aggregation accordingly. This can be achieved by incorporating the nullable properties of the Int64 data type into the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    nullable_int_dtypes = ['Int64', '<Int64']
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.values.dtype) and block.values.dtype.name in nullable_int_dtypes:
            block_values = maybe_convert_objects(
                block.values, try_float=True, convert_string=True, convert_integer=True
            )
        else:
            block_values = block.values

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block_values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # rest of the function follows...
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to handle nullable integer data types specifically and convert them to the appropriate type before performing the aggregation. This ensures that the nullable properties of the Int64 data type are properly handled during aggregation operations, avoiding the TypeError issue reported in the GitHub issue.
