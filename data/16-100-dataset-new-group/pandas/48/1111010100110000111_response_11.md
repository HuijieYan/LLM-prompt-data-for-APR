**Bug Analysis:**
The error is occurring when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer (`Int64`) dtype.
The bug seems to be related to the way the values are being cast and the dtype being handled, resulting in a TypeError during the safe casting process.

**Error Location:**
The error seems to be related to the data type casting and handling in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the `_from_sequence` function and the subsequent handling of the result could be the potential error locations.

**Cause of the Bug:**
The bug occurs when casting float64 to int64 using the `astype` method with the "safe" casting rule. This causes the TypeError due to the unsafe casting of non-equivalent data types.

**Strategy for Fixing the Bug:**
The bug can be fixed by explicitly handling the nullable integer dtype (`Int64`) and ensuring appropriate casting based on the actual data type. Additionally, when calling the `_from_sequence` function, it should handle the nullable integer dtype properly to avoid the TypeError.


**Corrected Version of the Function:**
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    for block in data.blocks:
        ...
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            if isinstance(maybe_convert_objects(block.values, maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result.dtype)), np.ndarray):
                # Safely cast the values to the dtype if they are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the ints.
                try:
                    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                    result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block.dtype)
                    agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                except (TypeError, ValueError) as err:
                    casted = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(block.values, result.dtype)
                    if (casted == result).all():
                        agg_block = block.make_block(casted)
                    else:
                        raise TypeError(
                            f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype(block.dtype)}"
                        ) from err
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    ...
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` functions are used to handle the safe casting process.
2. The `astype` method is avoided in favor of more explicit and safe casting.
3. The error handling has been improved to properly cast and handle the nullable integer dtype.
4. The potential TypeError condition has been explicitly handled and raised for non-equivalent data types.

With these changes, the bug should be addressed, and the corrected function should handle the safe casting and dtype conversion properly.
