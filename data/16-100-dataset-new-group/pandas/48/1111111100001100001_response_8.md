The bug exists in the for loop in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where a certain condition is not handled properly, leading to incorrect values. The issue seems to be related to how the logic handles the different cases in the loop.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review and refactor the logic within the for loop to handle different cases properly based on the expected behavior for each aggregation function such as mean, median, or variance.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if not pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(block.dtype):
            # Exclude non-numeric block types
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if how == "var":
            result = block.var()
        elif how == "median":
            result = block.median()
        else:
            result = block.mean()

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
    deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
    ai = np.arange(len(data))
    mask = np.zeros(len(data))
    mask[deleted] = 1
    indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
