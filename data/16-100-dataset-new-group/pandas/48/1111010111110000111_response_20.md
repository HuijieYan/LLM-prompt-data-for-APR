The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has a bug that causes it to return values of the wrong data type, leading to TypeError when calling certain aggregation functions like mean, median, or var on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 data type.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly, leading to incorrect type casting and resulting in a TypeError when calling the aggregation functions.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the function handles the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly and performs type casting appropriately to avoid the TypeError when calling the aggregation functions.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # handling Int64 data type explicitly
        if block.values.dtype == 'Int64':
            # convert to float if the block type is Int64
            result = block.values.astype(float)  # convert to float
        else:
            result = block.values  # no conversion needed
        
        # aggregate the result
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly, and the type casting will be performed appropriately to avoid the TypeError when calling the aggregation functions.
