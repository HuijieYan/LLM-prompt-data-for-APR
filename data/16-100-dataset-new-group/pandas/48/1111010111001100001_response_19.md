The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing to properly handle the aggregation tasks for the `DataFrame` objects. It's intended to: 
1. Get numeric data to aggregate if `numeric_only` is set to `True`.
2. Iterate over each block of the `DataFrame` to perform the aggregation, being careful to check for unsupported operations.
3. Combine the resulting aggregate blocks into a final result. 

The issue arises in the `try` and `except` blocks, where an incorrect result is assigned to the variable `result`. This leads to the incorrect values being used in the subsequent computations. To fix the bug:
- The correct values should be checked before assigning to `result` within the `try` block.
- The appropriate data types should be considered while grouping and aggregating.
- The behavior on failure to perform the operations should be thoroughly checked to handle any exceptions gracefully.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data().astype(float)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = np.array([[0.0] * len(data.items)], dtype=float)

        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # If we have numeric_only=False and non-applicable functions, 
            # prefer to perform the operation in an alternate way
            if alt is not None:
                try:
                    result = block.values.apply(alt, axis=self.axis)
                except Exception:
                    # An exception occurred, exclude the block
                    continue

        # Exclude any non-numeric results 
        if not np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.number):
            # continue and exclude the block
            continue

        if how in ['var', 'std']:
            if min_count > 0:
                na_mask = block.values.isna()
                n = len(data.items) - na_mask.sum()
                if n < min_count:
                    # continue and exclude the block
                    continue

        # Convert the resulting array to a new Block
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected version addresses the issue where the incorrect value was being assigned to `result` within the `try` block. Also, it ensures that unsupported operations are handled properly and the results are being correctly typecasted to the specific dtype defined by the `Block` object.
