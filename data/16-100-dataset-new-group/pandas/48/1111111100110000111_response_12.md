The bug seems to be related to the type casting issue, specifically converting float64 to int64, in the `pandas` library. The error message indicates that a TypeError occurs when attempting to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64 using the `astype` method. The error is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError.

The cause of the bug is likely a problem with handling the `astype` method in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function is trying to convert float64 values to int64, which is not possible according to the safe casting rule.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the type casting issue correctly. This may involve checking whether a value can be safely cast to the specified dtype, and then providing an appropriate handling for cases where safe casting is not possible.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous logic)

        # Safely cast the block to the original dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(block.values, dtype=block.dtype)
        
        # ... (rest of the logic)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # ... (previous logic)

    # ... (rest of the logic)
```

In the corrected function, we use the `maybe_convert_objects` function to safely cast the block values to the original dtype. This function handles the conversion of float64 values to int64 appropriately, and ensures that the safe casting rule is respected.

After making this change, the function should be able to handle type casting issues more effectively, and the TypeError related to the type casting problem should be resolved.

It's important to note that this is a hypothetical solution based on the limited information provided. The actual fix may require deeper understanding of the `pandas` library and the specific requirements of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Therefore, it's recommended to consult the maintainers of the `pandas` library or explore the official issue thread on GitHub for the latest updates and official fixes.
