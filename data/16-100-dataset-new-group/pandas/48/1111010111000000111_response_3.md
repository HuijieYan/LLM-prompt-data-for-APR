The provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` has multiple potential error locations. However, based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, it seems that the issue is related to grouping and aggregating nullable integer data using functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

The cause of the bug is the failure of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data while aggregating with the mentioned functions. This results in a `TypeError` when calling these aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle nullable integer data when performing aggregation operations. This can be achieved by checking the dtype of the data and applying the appropriate logic for nullable integer data types during the aggregation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if block.dtype.type == np.integer and block.isna().any():
            result = np.nan
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```

In the corrected version, we check the dtype of the block, and if it's an integer type with NaN values, we assign the result as `np.nan` to handle nullable integer data during aggregation.

This correction should resolve the issue highlighted in the GitHub bug report, and the failing tests should pass with this corrected implementation.
