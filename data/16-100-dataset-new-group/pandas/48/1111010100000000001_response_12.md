The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a member of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, and it aims to compute aggregated blocks from a set of input data blocks based on some grouping criteria. The function uses a strategy to identify and aggregate numeric data only, while handling object-dtype blocks and potentially splitting them into separate blocks.

The potential errors in this function seem to be related to how it handles the aggregation of data blocks and the logic around checking for numeric data, dealing with object-dtype blocks, and managing the resulting items and blocks.

The cause of the bug could be related to how the function handles edge cases, such as when there are no numeric types to aggregate or when the blocks are split into separate items.

To fix the bug, we can try a strategy that involves refactoring the logic around handling the aggregation of numeric and object-dtype blocks as well as how it manages the resulting items and blocks.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number], copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                continue

        if not isinstance(result, (DataFrame, np.ndarray)):
            continue

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):     
            result = result.to_numpy()

        if len(result.shape) == 1:
            result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_block = make_block(result, block.items, klass=Block, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(agg_block)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    idx = np.concatenate([blk.mgr_locs for blk in new_items])
    idx = np.argsort(idx)
    agg_items = data.items.take(idx)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function selects only numeric block data when `numeric_only` is `True` using the `select_dtypes` method. It then aggregates the data and appends the results to the `agg_blocks` list. Before returning, it maps the original data items to the new items in the aggregated blocks. This approach aims to resolve the potential errors and improve the overall functionality of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
