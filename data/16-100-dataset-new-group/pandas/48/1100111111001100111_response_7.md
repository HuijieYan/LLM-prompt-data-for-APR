The issue seems to be related to an error that occurs when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 data type, resulting in a `TypeError`. The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does occur with `median` and `std`.

The issue arises when calling `mean` after grouping, but works when using `int64` dtype or when taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy.

Based on the given information, there might be an issue with how the function `_cython_agg_blocks` handles data with the Int64 data type when computing the mean.

To fix this bug, the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be modified to handle the Int64 data type correctly when computing the mean. This could involve checking for the dtype of the data and using a different method to calculate the mean when the data type is Int64.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that attempts to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (rest of the loop remains the same)

        if block.dtype.name == 'Int64' and how == 'mean':
            # handle Int64 dtype separately
            result = block.values.to_numpy().astype(float).mean()
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(np.array([result]))
        else:
            # for other dtype or other operations, proceed as before
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=0
            )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

This corrected version includes a check to handle the mean operation with the Int64 data type separately. By converting the Int64 data to float and then computing the mean, it ensures that the mean operation is correctly handled for the Int64 data type.

It's important to note that the actual implementation might need to be adjusted based on the specific behavior of the Int64 data type in the DataFrameGroupBy context.

After applying this fix, running the failing tests should validate the correction and resolve the bug.
