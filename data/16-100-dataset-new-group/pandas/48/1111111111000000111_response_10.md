Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely causing the TypeError when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, which is the subject of the GitHub issue. The bug is likely due to issues with handling nullable integer data types during aggregation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types correctly during aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        block_data = block.values
        agg_func = getattr(block_data, how)  # Get the aggregation function

        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block_data):  # Check if the data is integer type
            # Exclude NA values and convert to float for aggregation
            block_data = block_data[pd.notna(block_data)].astype('float')

        result = agg_func(block_data, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        # Create a new block with the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, block.items, ndim=1)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version includes a check for nullable integer data types and correctly handles them during aggregation.

Please note that the corrected version may need to be tested against other use cases to ensure its correctness and stability.
