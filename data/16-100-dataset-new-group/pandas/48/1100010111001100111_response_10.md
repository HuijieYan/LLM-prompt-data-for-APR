Based on the failing test and the runtime input/output variable values, it seems that the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function may be related to the calculation of the mean, median, or var (variance) of DataFrameGroupBy objects that have nullable integer data types.

The issue on GitHub also confirms that calling mean, median, or var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError, while other methods like min, max, or first work without error.

To fix the bug, you can add an exception handling block specifically for mean, median, and var calculations when the dataframe contains nullable integer data types. Within that exception block, you can implement a different method for calculating the mean, median, or var.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function based on the analysis:

```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]:

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if how in {"mean", "median", "var"} and block.dtype.type == np.integer:
                # Special handling for mean, median, and var with nullable integer data type
                result = block.values.astype(float).mean(axis=1).reshape(-1, 1) if how == "mean" else \
                         block.values.astype(float).median(axis=1, skipna=True).reshape(-1, 1) if how == "median" else \
                         block.values.astype(float).var(axis=1, ddof=0).reshape(-1, 1)
            else:
                raise
        except Exception:
            # Handle any other exceptions
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        # Rest of the code for creating agg_blocks, etc.
        # ...
```

In the corrected version of the function:
1. There is an additional exception handling block specifically for mean, median, and var calculations when the data has a nullable integer data type. This block handles the mean, median, and var calculations differently by casting the values to float and using the respective methods for each operation.

By adding this exception handling, the function should handle mean, median, and var calculations with nullable integer data types without raising a TypeError.

Please note the exception block in the suggested corrected function may not be the most efficient in terms of performance. Therefore, further improvement could be made if performance becomes a concern.
