The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the aggregation operation performed on the DataFrame groupby object. The bug is causing a `TypeError` when calling `mean` after grouping results in the grouped DataFrame by integer type.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to the operations and type inference on the grouped data. The error occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, and `std` after grouping the DataFrame. The issue provided on GitHub also confirms this behavior.

To fix this bug, the code must handle the special case of aggregating the grouped data with integer dtype, particularly when performing operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    # Process object-dtype blocks
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Handle the specific case of integer dtype
        if block.dtype == "Int64":
            # Convert to float64 dtype to avoid TypeError on aggregation operations
            result = result.astype("float64")

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In the corrected version, we address the specific issue related to integer dtype by converting the result to `float64` dtype if the block has an "Int64" dtype. This approach ensures that the aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std` can be performed without raising a `TypeError` when the data has integer dtype.

By implementing this fix, the function should now handle the special cases of integer dtype when aggregating the grouped data, resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
