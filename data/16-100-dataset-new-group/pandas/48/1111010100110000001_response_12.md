The issue is related to the individual elements in the `values` array and the way they are being cast to the specified dtype. The error message indicates that the function is trying to cast an array of float64 elements to an int64 dtype which is resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the handling and casting of values should be revised. It is likely that a cast from float64 to int64 may not be feasible if the values themselves are not equivalent (as indicated by the error message). A strategy for fixing the bug would be to identify the source of the issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the `safe_cast` method and its associated `astype` calls. It is best to review whether the elements of the `values` array can safely be cast to the specified dtype or need to be handled differently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, needs_safe_cast = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        if needs_safe_cast:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_numeric=False)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (skip to end for remaining code)
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this solution, inside the loop, the `aggregate` function returns both the result and a flag indicating whether a safe cast is needed. If a safe cast is required, the `maybe_convert_objects` function is called with `convert_numeric=False` which will apply type conversion where necessary without directly converting float64 elements to int64. This should fix the bug by ensuring that non-equivalent float64 values are not directly cast to int64, thus resolving the TypeError.
