From the error message and GitHub issue, it seems that there is an issue with the casting of values from float64 to int64. The error occurs when calling aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.

The error message indicates that the `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` is being raised during the safe casting of values from float to int.

Looking at the source code of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it seems that the issue may be in the section where it tries to cast the block back to the original dtype using the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function. It also checks the `is_extension` attribute of the block, which could cause issues in casting.

Given the context from the error message, the source code, and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to the casting of values from float to int when performing aggregation operations on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.

One strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the casting of values from float to int more carefully. Additionally, it may be necessary to update the logic for handling extension blocks to ensure that the casting is done correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, series=block.is_series_like)
        maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_locs)

        new_items.append(block.items)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In the corrected version, I've removed the specific handling for extension blocks and directly used the `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_numeric` functions to handle the casting and downcasting of values. This should ensure that the casting is done correctly, addressing the TypeError that was raised.

This correction has been made based on the assumption that the issue was related to the inappropriate handling of extension blocks and the casting of values when performing aggregation operations. However, further testing and validation might be needed to confirm that the bug has been fixed.
