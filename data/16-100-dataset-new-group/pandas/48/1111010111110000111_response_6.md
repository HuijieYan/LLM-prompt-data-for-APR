The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing an issue when calling mean, median, or var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The error occurs due to an attempt to convert the values to an inappropriate type, and the error message shows that the casting fails from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'.

In order to fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to properly handle nullable integer data types when aggregating. Specifically, it should avoid attempting to cast the values to an inappropriate type and perform the aggregation based on the input data types. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
          
        agg_block : Block = make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

    # rest of the code to reindex and return agg_blocks and agg_items
```

After making these changes, the function should be able to handle nullable integer data types properly during aggregation, and the error should be resolved.

It's important to check whether the correction of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function resolves the issue as reported in the GitHub issue. If the corrected function solves the problem, it can be tested with the failing test cases to ensure that it now returns the expected results without raising any TypeErrors.
