The issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to how the DataFrame is processed or the way certain calculations are performed as it groups and aggregates data. The function runs into problems with the calculation of aggregate blocks.

Some of the potential error locations can include calculating aggregations with NaN values in the DataFrame, handling split items, or managing the indexes when some items are deleted.

To fix the bug, it would be necessary to review how the DataFrame is being processed, the calculations being performed on it, and how the data is handled during aggregation.

Here's a revised version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that attempts to address the potential issues identified:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset block locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised version focuses on handling each block individually and tracking the locations to adjust the aggregations accordingly. Additionally, it simplifies some of the operations, potentially avoiding issues related to split items and deleted items.

Please test this revised version with the failing test case scenario to validate its correctness.
