The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing an issue that needs to be fixed. The buggy class DataFrameGroupBy is inheriting the GroupBy class.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The `no_result` variable is not being used within the exception handling.
2. The lines that handle the exception cases and the alternate way of performing the operation are causing confusion and not working correctly.

The cause of the bug is that the exception handling for `NotImplementedError` is not correctly implemented, and it leads to incorrect aggregation.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be:
1. To properly handle the `NotImplementedError` and perform the aggregation in an alternate way if `alt` is provided.
2. Ensure that the `no_result` variable is used correctly to avoid inheriting a result from earlier in the loop.
3. Clean up the mess left over from split blocks by adjusting the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the exception handling for `NotImplementedError` has been improved, and the `no_result` variable is utilized within the loop to avoid inheriting the result from an earlier iteration. Additionally, the cleanup for split blocks has been updated to ensure the locs in the blocks correspond to the current ordering.
