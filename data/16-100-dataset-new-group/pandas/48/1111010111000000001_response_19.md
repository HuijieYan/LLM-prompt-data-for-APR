First, the code provided contains multiple test functions that aren't necessarily related to the issue at hand. We'll focus on the first test function that fails:
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "values",
    [
        {
            "a": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
            "b": [1, pd.NA, 2, 1, pd.NA, 2, 1, pd.NA, 2],
        },
        {"a": [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3], "b": [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]},
    ],
)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("function", ["mean", "median", "var"])
def test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float(values, function):
    # https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/32219
    output = 0.5 if function == "var" else 1.5
    arr = np.array([output] * 3, dtype=float)
    idx = pd.Index([1, 2, 3], dtype=object, name="a")
    expected = pd.DataFrame({"b": arr}, index=idx)

    groups = pd.DataFrame(values, dtype="Int64").groupby("a")

    result = getattr(groups, function)()
    tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)

    result = groups.agg(function)
    tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)

    result = groups.agg([function])
    expected.columns = MultiIndex.from_tuples([("b", function)])
    tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)
```

From the failing test function, it looks like it's verifying that applying specific functions (`mean`, `median`, `var`) to nullable integers returns the expected output. The failure likely means that one of these operations produced an incorrect result, which could be caused by the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks`.

Upon closer inspection of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it seems to be manipulating and aggregating data blocks within a DataFrame group. It has several complex operations that could potentially cause incorrect outputs. One thing to note is that the function deals with different block types and tries to determine the result based on the input blocks. There are also exception handling blocks which hint at specific edge cases.

The cause of the bug could be related to how the function handles nullable integers or alternative methods of aggregation. Since the failing test is specific to nullable integers and particular aggregation functions, the issue might be due to the handling of `pd.NA` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function during aggregation, especially for functions like `var` which operate differently on nullable integers.

To remedy this, one possible strategy for fixing the bug is to review and revise the logic for handling nullable integers, especially with respect to the `pd.NA` values and their impact on aggregation operations. Additionally, the handling of the desired aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `var` should be thoroughly reviewed and tested.

Here's a corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks` that takes into account the need for proper handling of nullable integers:

```python
# Provided corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # more items will be listed here

    # Check for null values in the DataFrame and handle appropriately
    if data.isna().any().any():
        if how in {"mean", "median", "var"}:
            # Handle `pd.NA` values for specific aggregation functions
            # appropriately (e.g. replace with the average non-NaN value for mean).
            if how == "mean":
                data = data.fillna(data.mean())
            elif how == "median":
                data = data.fillna(data.median())
            elif how == "var":
                data = data.fillna(data.mean())  # Adjust if necessary
        else:
            # For other aggregation functions, NaN values can simply be dropped.
            data = data.dropna()

    # Rest of the logic goes here

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that the corrected version provided above is a simplified example to demonstrate handling of nullable integer values. Depending on the actual requirements and intended behavior, the logic inside `_cython_agg_blocks` may need further modifications. Additional edge cases may also need to be considered based on the detailed knowledge of the DataFrame and aggregation operations being performed.
