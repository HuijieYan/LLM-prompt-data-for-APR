There appears to be an issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The function seems to be trying to aggregate data based on certain criteria and create new Blocs as a result. However, in the cases provided, the result at the end of the function seems to be a 1x3 array without any data exceptions.

Based on the input and the values of variables, it looks like the function is not able to handle the specified behavior properly. It seems to be encountering issues with calculating aggregate data based on the input parameters.

In order to fix the bug, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and potentially the `grouper` and `self.obj` elements. The issue may lie in how these components interact and how the aggregation is being performed. 

Here's a potential solution:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Perform aggregation based on 'how' parameter
        # ...
        # Other existing logic for agg_blocks generation

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Other existing logic for creating agg_items and adjusting indexer

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
With this solution, I have omitted some parts of the original function for brevity and focused on suggesting an approach to solve the aggregation calculation issue. The recommendation is to review and potentially re-implement the aggregation logic to ensure that it applies the desired aggregation method correctly.
