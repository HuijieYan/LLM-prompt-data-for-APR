Looking at the error messages, the `safe_cast` function is trying to convert a `float64` array to an `int64` array using the `astype` method, which is failing due to the non-equivalence of the types.

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, which is most likely causing the exception reflected in the error messages.

A strategy for fixing this bug is to ensure that values are compatible before casting them. This can be done by using the `dtype` attribute to check if the blocks are of the same type before performing operations on them. Additionally, handle the case in which non-equivalent values are encountered during the cast, and avoid raising a TypeError in those cases.

Below is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# assuming that input parameters such as self, how, alt, numeric_only, min_count are accurately defined in the original function

def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing function body goes here

    for block in data.blocks:
        # other parts of the function go here

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            new_result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            if block.dtype == new_result.dtype:
                # safe to cast
                result = new_result
            else:
                # Not equivalent types, avoid casting
                result = block.values.copy()
        
        # remaining logic continues

    # remaining logic continues
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check to determine if the original dtype and the downcasted dtype match, and proceed with the cast only if they are equivalent. If not, we use a copy of the original values instead of attempting the unsafe cast. This approach should resolve the issue and eliminate the TypeError caused by trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.
