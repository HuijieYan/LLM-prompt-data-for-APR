The analysis of the buggy function and its relationship with the failing test code reveals that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing to produce the expected result when dealing with nullable integer values. The `getattr` and `agg` methods are specifically testing for mean, median, and var functions on a nullable integer DataFrame grouped by integer values. The test is asserting that the returned result should be an exact DataFrame with float values. 

The potential error locations within the `cython_agg_blocks` function may include the logic for handling nullable integer data types. It seems that the function is not handling nullable integer data properly, which results in incorrect aggregation output.

The cause of the bug is related to the mishandling of nullable integer data during the aggregation process, leading to incorrect results. The `DataFrame` or nullable integer type might not be handled properly in the `cython_agg_blocks` function, causing the failing tests.

A strategy for fixing the bug could be to ensure that the function properly handles nullable integer data types during the aggregation process. It should account for NaN or NA values and process the nullable integer type accordingly to produce the expected result. The logic for checking and handling nullable integer values may need to be modified to align with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if isinstance(block, Block):
            result = block._try_aggregate_string_function(
                self.grouper, how, alt=alt, axis=self.axis
            )
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis)

        # Handle nullable integer data types
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and pd.api.types.is_nullable_dtype(result.dtype):
            result = pd.Series(result, dtype=float)

        # Create new block for the aggregated result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

In the corrected version, the function properly handles nullable integer data types by converting them to a standard float data type to ensure correct aggregation results. This modification aligns with the expected behavior of the function and is expected to make the failing test cases pass.
