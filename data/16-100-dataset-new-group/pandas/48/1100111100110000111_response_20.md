Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue, it seems that the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering issues when casting the values from float64 to int64. This error is specifically occurring when using the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The specific line causing the issue is:
```python
result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype)
```

This line is trying to cast the result to the original dtype, which is leading to a TypeError when the dtype is being cast from float64 to int64.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle the safe casting more effectively by checking if the original dtype is an extension type and handling the casting accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # omitted - previous code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # omitted - previous code
        
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        if result.dtype != block.values.dtype:
            if block.is_extension:
                casted = result.astype(block.values.dtype)
                if (casted == result).all():
                    result = casted
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {block.values.dtype}"
                    )
            else:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    # omitted - remaining code
```

This corrected version checks if the original dtype is an extension type and handles the casting accordingly. If the dtype is an extension type, it first tries to safely cast the values and then checks if the casted values are equivalent. If they are equivalent, it uses the casted values; otherwise, it raises a TypeError.

This modification should address the TypeError when trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, as reported in the GitHub issue.
