## Bug Explanation
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data in the `BlockManager` based on the parameters `how` and `numeric_only`. The bug seems to be related to splitting object-dtype blocks, particularly for cases where the `how` parameter is `'var'`. The function appears to contain logic for exceptional cases that may result from implementing alternate aggregator functions, but a constraint is not properly handled, specifically when the `alt` parameter is `None` and `how` is not equal to `'ohlc'`.

## Proposed Fix
The function needs to be reviewed to ensure that all exceptional cases are handled and that the logic for the alternate aggregator functions is well-defined and aligned with the expected behavior for different `how` parameters. Additionally, potential issues with splitting object-dtype blocks should be addressed, especially in the context of aggregating with `'var'`.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, incorporating the relevant bug fixes:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Logic for alternative aggregation
        result, locs = <code for aggregating based on how and alt>

        # Handling the exceptional case where alt is None
        if alt is None:
            if how != "ohlc":
                # Properly excluding the block for var
                if how == "var":
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
        
        # Rest of the existing logic can be retained

    <remaining code>
```

Please note that the actual implementation of the alternative aggregation logic may vary depending on the specific behavior desired for each `how` parameter. This proposed fix provides a general outline for handling the exceptional cases and ensuring that the function behaves as expected for different aggregation scenarios.

Additional input regarding the specific behavior and edge cases for the aggregation function will help refine the proposed fix further.
