Based on the buggy function and the failing test cases, it seems that the issue is related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The problem might be occurring in the logic used to build `agg_blocks` and `new_items` lists or the handling of grouped results. It is likely that there are some incorrect data transformations, causing the function to produce incorrect results.

To fix this, I would suggest reviewing the data transformation process and ensuring that the functional and logic flow adheres to the intended behavior of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[List] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if alt is not None and isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        new_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(new_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, each data block is processed individually to perform aggregation based on the specified function and options. The results are properly appended to `agg_blocks` and `new_items` lists, and the final `indexer` is used for reordering the blocks based on the groupings.

Keep in mind that this fix assumes that the underlying logic for aggregation and data manipulation is correctly implemented in the related functions and methods. Further adjustments may be necessary if the issue persists, or if additional dependencies are involved.
