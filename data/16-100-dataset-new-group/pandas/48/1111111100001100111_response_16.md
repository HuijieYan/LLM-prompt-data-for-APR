### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs when trying to call the `_cython_agg_blocks` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. The function is failing due to errors when attempting to calculate aggregate statistics such as mean, median, var, etc. for columns with the `Int64` dtype. The error is likely related to the handling of nullable integer data types within the function's logic. The error message being encountered is a `TypeError`.

### Bug Fix Strategy
The fix for this bug will likely involve modifying the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle the `Int64` dtype when calculating aggregate statistics. Specifically, this may involve adjusting the type handling and computation steps to accommodate the nullable integer data type.

### Bug Fix
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/generic.py

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def aggregate(self, func=None, *args, **kwargs):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def _get_data_to_aggregate(self) -> BlockManager:
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
@pin_whitelisted_properties(DataFrame, base.dataframe_apply_whitelist)
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    # ... (other functions)

    # The corrected version of the buggy function
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()

        for block in data.blocks:
            # ... (existing logic)

            # Modify the logic for handling nullable integer data types
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values.to_numpy(), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the NotImplementedError

        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        if split_items:
            # ... (existing logic)

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The suggested fix involves explicitly handling the nullable integer data type within the logic of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. By utilizing the `.to_numpy()` method to convert the data to a NumPy array, the function can properly handle the nullable integer data type when calculating aggregate statistics.

Note: The complete fix may involve additional changes to properly handle the nullable integer data type throughout the function. The provided fix is a simplified example intended to illustrate the general approach.
