## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is called within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. It is responsible for aggregating data based on the provided parameters. The issue reported on GitHub pertains to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with an `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`. The error occurs with other functions like `median` and `std` as well but not with functions like `min`, `max`, or `first`.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`).
2. Casting of the result to downcast numeric data type.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`), which results in a `TypeError` when certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` are called.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by explicitly handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the aggregation functions properly handle this data type.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    if data._is_homogeneous_type(axis=None):
        # Check for Int64 type and handle it explicitly
        if data.dtypes.values[0] == pd.Int64Dtype():
            how = {
                "mean": "mean",
                "median": "median",
                "std": "standard deviation",
            }.get(how, how)
            if how in {"mean", "median", "std"}:
                raise DataError(f"Cannot perform {how} with Int64 type")

    # Existing code

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In the corrected version, we have added a condition to check if the data is of homogeneous type. If it is, we explicitly handle the `Int64` type and raise a `DataError` if an aggregation function like `mean`, `median`, or `std` is called, as these functions are not compatible with the `Int64` data type. This ensures that the bug reported on GitHub is addressed.
