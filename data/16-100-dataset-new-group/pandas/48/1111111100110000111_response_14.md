## Issue Analysis
The issue occurs when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. It results in a TypeError. This problem is specific to the new nullable integer data type.

## Potential Error Locations
The error may be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where the safe cast from `float64` to `int64` is attempted.

## Cause of the Bug
The actual cause of the bug is the inability to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` based on the rule 'safe'. This is due to the new nullable integer data type causing issues with casting during the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy for fixing the bug would involve refining the implementation of casting and aggregation within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. There may be a need to handle the nullable integer data type in a special way to ensure proper aggregation and type casting.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing implementation

    for block in agg_blocks:
        result = maybe_convert_objects(block, try_float=True)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs))
```
