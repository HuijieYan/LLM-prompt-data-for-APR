A potential bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is that `agg_block` is being appended to `agg_blocks` before being assigned a value. This implies that `agg_block` is being appended with `None` or with an incorrect/faulty value. This could cause issues during the aggregation process. 

Another potential bug is in the use of `assert` statement for handling exceptions. Assert statements should generally not be used for error handling. It's possible that the assert statement may be interrupting the exception handling and causing the code not to proceed as expected.

To fix the above-mentioned issues, the function needs to be refactored to ensure that `agg_block` is correctly assigned a value before appending it to `agg_blocks`. Additionally, proper exception handling should be implemented using try-except blocks instead of assert statements.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
# import statements as outlined in the prompt

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # New handling of exceptions using try-except blocks
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Implement alternate handling logic or raise an error
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate handling logic required")
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array.dropna()]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        # Rest of the validation and result processing logic
        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

By implementing these changes, the code should now handle exceptions properly and ensure that `agg_block` is correctly assigned a non-null value before appending to `agg_blocks`. This should resolve the issues and enable the corrected function to pass the failing tests.
