The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function arises from the failing to downcast the aggregated result to the original dtype. This results in a TypeError when trying to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the result is downcasted to the original column dtype after aggregation. This can be achieved using the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function provided by pandas.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if result is not no_result:
        # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)  # Downcast the result to the original dtype

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            # ... (other code remains the same)
          
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By downcasting the result to the original dtype, we ensure that the Types do not mismatch and avoid the TypeError caused by the failing safe cast operation.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing tests without raising TypeError.
