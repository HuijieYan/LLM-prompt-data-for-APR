The bug arises when trying to safely cast the values from a float64 to an int64 using the `.astype()` method. The function `safe_cast` is supposed to securely cast values to a given data type, but it's unable to perform the operation when casting from float64 to int64, resulting in a TypeError. This issue is occurring during the groupby and aggregation process causing the failing test.

The strategy to fix this bug is to ensure that the cast from float64 to int64 is done safely, or alternatively, change the dtype of the values to be cast to the appropriate type before performing the cast.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                #  reductions; see GH#28949
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    # We've split an object block! Everything we've assumed
                    # about a single block input returning a single block output
                    # is a lie. To keep the code-path for the typical non-split case
                    # clean, we choose to clean up this mess later on.
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype.name == 'int64' and result.dtype.name == 'float64':
                result = np.round(result).astype('int64', casting="unsafe", copy=False)

            # ... (other cases and related conditions)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

In the corrected version, when attempting to cast from float64 to int64, it first checks if the current dtype is 'int64' and the result dtype is 'float64'. If so, it rounds the result and then casts it directly to 'int64' without safe casting, ensuring the correct dtype is applied.

By applying this fix, the `safe_cast` function will not encounter the error when attempting to safely cast the values, as it will correctly handle the unsafe cast operation. This should resolve the bug and make the function robust against this specific error.
