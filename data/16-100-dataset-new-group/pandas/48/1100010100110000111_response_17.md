#### Analysis and Identification of Potential Error Locations
The error message indicates a problem with casting an array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'. The error seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, specifically when working with nullable integer data type.

Potential Error Locations:
- The error might be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function due to a problem with casting from float to int while aggregating data in a groupby operation.

#### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function attempting to safely cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, which is causing a TypeError due to the casting rule 'safe'.

#### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 values to int64 in a way that ensures compatibility with nullable integer data type and avoids raising a TypeError.

#### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... existing code ...
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... existing code ...

        if result is not no_result:
            # ... existing code ...
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, np.float64)

                if result.name is not None and result.name not in agg_blocks[0].items:
                    try:
                        result = result.reindex(agg_blocks[0].items, copy=False)
                    except ValueError:
                        pass

                if numeric_only and not self.contains_numeric_only(result):
                    continue

                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(result)

    # ... existing code ...
```

The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function includes handling safe casting of non-equivalent float64 values to int64 by converting objects and downcasting to the appropriate dtype. This should resolve the TypeError when attempting to cast array values from float to int.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub post and should ensure that calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype no longer results in a TypeError.
