## Bug analysis
The bug seems to be related to calling the `mean` function after grouping a DataFrame with an `Int64` dtype. The bug results in a `TypeError`. The issue seems to be a problem with the new nullable integer data type and how it interacts with the `mean` function after grouping.

## Bug cause
The bug might be caused by how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles different data types, particularly the `Int64` dtype. It seems to result in the `TypeError` reported in the GitHub issue.

## Bug fix strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can handle the `Int64` dtype correctly when calling the `mean` function after grouping. This might involve handling nullable integer data types more effectively in the function.

## Corrected code
Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    # Handle nullable integer data types explicitly for the 'mean' function
    if 'Int64' in str(data.dtype):
        data = data[~pd.isna(data)]  # remove NA values for nullable integer types
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    # ... continue with the rest of the function
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle nullable integer data types (specifically 'Int64') by removing NA values before performing aggregation with the `mean` function. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
