Upon analyzing the provided function and the failing tests, it appears that the issue arises when the function tries to aggregate the data based on the specified method. It makes a class attribute assignment to `agt_blocks`, which will be replaced in each loop, resulting in the data being lost for each aggregation result.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves preserving the results obtained in each loop iteration by appending the aggregated `result` and `locs` to separate lists. Also, `agg_block` needs to be created within the valid scope of the loop iteration to correctly hold the aggregated result. Finally, the results can be combined at the end of the loop into `agg_blocks` using the aggregated `locs`.

Given this insight, here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_locs: List[np.ndarray] = []  # Preserving locs for each aggregation result

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Exception handling logic remains the same as before
            continue

        # ... (rest of the loop's body remains the same)

        # Append locs in each loop iteration for combining later
        agg_locs.append(locs)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # Extension block handling logic remains the same as before
                pass

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)  # Create agg_block in the valid scope

            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... (rest of the function)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected function will now preserve all the aggregation results and its corresponding locations during each iteration, and then combine them into `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` at the end. This should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests.
