The bug causes a TypeError when calling certain aggregation functions (such as mean, median, and var) on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer data type (dtype='Int64'). The error message indicates that there is an issue with casting the data types from float64 to int64.

The bug is likely caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` method attempting to cast the data incorrectly when using certain aggregation functions. The method is performing checks and type casting based on the functionality provided, but it seems to be facing issues with nullable integer data types.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle nullable integer data types properly, ensuring that the type casting is done correctly for the specific functionality being called.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (pre-existing code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if block.dtype.kind == 'i':
            # Handle nullable integer data type
            if how in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
                if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                    # If the result is a DataFrame, unwrap it and cast it safely
                    result = result._ data.blocks[0].values.astype(block.dtype, copy=False)
                else:
                    # If the result is a numpy array, cast it safely
                    result = maybe_convert_objects(
                        result, as_series=True, copy=False, dtype=block.dtype
                    )
        else:
            # Handle other data types (not nullable integer)
            result = maybe_convert_objects(
                result, as_series=True, copy=False, dtype=block.dtype
            )

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    # ... (existing code)
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the case for nullable integer data types when calling specific aggregation functions. We ensure that the type casting is done safely and appropriately based on the data type of the block.

By making these adjustments, the bug should be resolved, and the method should be able to handle nullable integer data types correctly when performing aggregations.

Additionally, the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method is expected to pass the failing test described in the GitHub issue.
