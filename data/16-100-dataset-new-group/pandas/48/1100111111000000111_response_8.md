## Analysis
The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is operating on grouped data, and it seems to be encountering issues when performing aggregation on grouped data with nullable integer (`Int64`) datatype. This suggests that there might be a bug in handling the nullable integer data type when applying aggregation functions.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely to be located in the section of the code where the function tries to handle the nullable integer data type, specifically in the part where it calls the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function and in handling the grouped data with `Int64` datatype.

## Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is related to the introduction of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the DataFrame and GroupBy operations. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is not properly handling the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can properly handle the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation. This might involve updating the logic around handling nullable integer data type and handling the grouped data with `Int64` datatype.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(dtypes='number', copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, has_vector_output = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, center=False
        )
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_numeric=False)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, fastpath=True)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function is unchanged
```
In the corrected version, we have updated the function to utilize the `self._get_data_to_aggregate()` method to get the data for aggregation and made changes to the handling of nullable integer data type and aggregation operations. We've also added a call to `maybe_convert_objects` to handle the nullable integer data type in the result. This corrected version should handle the nullable integer data type properly and resolve the `TypeError` issue.
