#### Steps for fixing the bug:
1. Analyze the buggy function, which is `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.
2. Identify potential error locations within the function, such as exception handling and aggregation operations.
3. The cause of the bug is identified from the failing test, which is related to calling aggregation functions on DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype, resulting in a TypeError.
4. A strategy for fixing the bug may involve checking the dtype and handling the nullable integer data appropriately during aggregation operations.
5. Here is the corrected version of the function that should pass the failing test and resolve the issue.

#### Corrected Version of the Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    else:
        data = data.to_numeric(copy=False, errors="coerce")

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_dates=False)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The changes made in the corrected version involve using the `to_numeric` method to handle the nullable integer data appropriately when `numeric_only` is `False`. Additionally, the `maybe_convert_objects` function is applied to the aggregation result to ensure the correct handling of object types.

These changes should address the bug and allow the function to successfully perform aggregation operations on DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype, resolving the issue described in the GitHub report.
