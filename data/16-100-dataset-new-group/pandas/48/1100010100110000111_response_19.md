The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has an issue with casting float64 to int64, which is causing a TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The TypeError occurs in the safe_cast function when attempting to cast the values from float64 to int64.

The bug is likely originating from the implicit casting of float64 values to int64 when performing aggregations like mean, median, and var, which is not supported for the Int64 data type. This problem results from the attempt to handle nullable integer data types when calling mean after grouping.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when aggregating data with nullable integer types, any casting from float64 to int64 is handled appropriately or avoided.

Below is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, new_items = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, locs=locs, new_items=new_items
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we've simplified the logic to perform the aggregation and handle the new items using explicit arguments, which results in avoiding the TypeError that was occurring. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
