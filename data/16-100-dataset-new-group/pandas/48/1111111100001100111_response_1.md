The bug in the provided function is likely causing the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue. The error seems to occur when calling groupby.mean() after using the new nullable integer data type. The expected behavior is to get the mean of the columns after grouping, but the bug is preventing that.

Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, it seems that the function is not handling nullable integer data types properly, resulting in a TypeError. The function needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data types correctly.

To fix the bug:
1. In the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, add a check for the data type of the input DataFrame. If the data type is nullable integer (`Int64`), handle it differently to ensure proper aggregation.

2. Use a conditional statement to differentiate between nullable integer and other data types, such as regular integers or floats.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    # Add a check to handle nullable integer data types differently
    if isinstance(self.obj, pd.DataFrame) and self.obj.dtypes.eq('Int64').any():
        data = data.get_numeric_data()  # Handle nullable integer data types differently
    elif numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # ... existing code ...
```

By adding this check and handling nullable integer data types separately, the function should be able to properly process the input data with nullable integer data types and return the expected output without TypeErrors.

This change addresses the GitHub issue related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype and should resolve the problem reported in the issue.
