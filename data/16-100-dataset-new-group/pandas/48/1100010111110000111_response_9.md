The bug is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype. This is reported in GitHub issue #32219.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should avoid calling the `astype` method on the `values` array using the target `dtype`. Instead, it should use a safe casting method to check the dtype compatibility of the values array and then perform the cast if they are equivalent.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ...
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False, try_integer=True)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, copy=False)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # ...

    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By using the `maybe_convert_objects`, `maybe_downcast_numeric`, and `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` methods, the function ensures safe casting when aggregating blocks, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by casting from `float64` to `int64`.

This corrected function should resolve the bug and pass the failing test cases, thereby addressing GitHub issue #32219.
