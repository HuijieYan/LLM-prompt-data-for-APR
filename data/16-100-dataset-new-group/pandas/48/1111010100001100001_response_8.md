The cause of the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to incorrect handling of the result array and subsequent processing. The bug might be caused by incorrect variable assignments and operations within the for loop, particularly with respect to the data manipulation and aggregation logic. The issues appear to arise when calculating the result and preparing the aggregation blocks, resulting in incorrect shapes or contents.

A strategy to fix the bug could involve reviewing the data manipulation and aggregation logic within the for loop, specifically checking the result type and shape, as well as verifying the correctness of the aggregation block creation. It's also essential to ensure accurate indexing and referencing of the resulting data from the aggregation.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No valid types to aggregate")

    # Additional processing and indexing logic here...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

It's important to revisit the entire logic for data processing within the for loop to ensure that the result is correctly calculated and processed to create the aggregation blocks. Additionally, the final steps regarding indexing and returning the result should be handled accurately to ensure correctness.
