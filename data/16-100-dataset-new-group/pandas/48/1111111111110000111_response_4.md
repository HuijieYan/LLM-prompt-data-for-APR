The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function from the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file appears to cause a `TypeError` when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `dtype='Int64'`. 

The issue arises when there is an attempt to cast non-equivalent float values to integer values. This error is caused by the usage of the numpy `astype` function within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, which attempts to cast `float64` to `int64` according to the safe casting rule, and fails because these dtypes are not equivalent.

To fix the bug, the casting should be handled differently, and the issue might be mostly concerning the handling of `dtype='Int64'`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    idx = data.items
    agg_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        new_block = self._cython_agg_block(block, how)
        agg_blocks.append(new_block)
    return agg_blocks, idx
```

This corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks` ensures that each block from the `BlockManager` is passed to `_cython_agg_block` for aggregation and doesn't attempt dtype conversions.

This should resolve the issue and allow the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions to work as expected on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `dtype='Int64'`.
