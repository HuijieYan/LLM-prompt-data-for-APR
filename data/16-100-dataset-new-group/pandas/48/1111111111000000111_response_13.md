The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing due to the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue was reported in a GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError." The buggy function is failing the following test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` in the file `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py`.

The cause of the bug is the inability to handle the mean function when applied to a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. This is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function not handling the Int64 dtype properly when calculating the mean.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the Int64 dtype properly when aggregating functions such as mean in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the function should be modified to correctly handle the Int64 dtype during aggregation, ensuring that it does not result in a TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            # Here, handle the Int64 dtype properly when calculating the mean
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]].astype(float)  # Convert Int64 to float
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)
        # rest of the function remains the same
```

By handling the Int64 dtype properly when using the mean function in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the bug should be resolved, and the corrected version should pass the failing test and address the issue reported on GitHub.
