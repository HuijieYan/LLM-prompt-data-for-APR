The issue with the `Buggy function` is caused by incorrect handling of the `DataType` of the input, which results in a `TypeError`.

The actual problem is that the original function doesn't correctly handle the nullable integer (`Int64`) datatype. When trying to aggregate data using `mean`, `median`, or `var`, it results in a `TypeError`. The function does not consider the appropriate behavior for these functions when the data contains nullable integers.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the nullable integer datatype correctly for aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
        
    if data.is_integer():
        data = data.astype("float64")
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code to handle the new_items and return the agg_blocks and agg_items
    # ...
```

The modified function first checks if the data contains integer values and converts it to `float64` if it does. Then, it correctly performs the aggregation using the converted data. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue with nullable integer datatype when using aggregation functions.

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle nullable integer datatypes, and the failing test cases related to the GitHub issue should pass.
