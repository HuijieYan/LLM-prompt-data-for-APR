Looking at the provided buggy function and the failing test, the issue reported on GitHub, and the error messages, it seems that the bug is related to the use of the nullable integer data type ('Int64') in combination with the `groupby` and aggregation functions in pandas.

The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting the array from float to integer type. This can be related to the specifics of the 'Int64' data type and the way it interacts with the aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the 'Int64' data type appropriately when applying aggregation functions in the `groupby` operation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=True)  # Change copy argument to True

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for locs, block in data.items_iter():
        # Update the loop to handle nullable integer data type
        if block.dtype.name.startswith('Int'):
            block = block.astype(float)

        result, _ = block.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
        # ...
```

This corrected version includes handling of the 'Int64' data type by explicitly converting it to a float type before performing the aggregation. This should resolve the issue with TypeError when calling `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with 'Int64' dtype.

With this change, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
