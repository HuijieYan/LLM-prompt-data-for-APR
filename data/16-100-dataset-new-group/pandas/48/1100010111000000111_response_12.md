Based on the GitHub issue and the failing test, the bug seems to be related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with an Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The bug occurs when using the new nullable integer data type, and it causes issues with mean, median, and std functions. 

To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we should check for the nullable integer data type and handle it appropriately when aggregating using the mean function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if issubclass(result.dtype.type, np.integer):
            result = result.astype(float)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code to sort and return the aggregated blocks

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, after aggregating the data using the `self.grouper.aggregate` function, we check if the dtype of the result is a subclass of integers. If it is, we convert the result to the float dtype using the `astype` method. This should fix the bug related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with an Int64 dtype, resolving the TypeError issue described in the GitHub report.

By incorporating these changes to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately during aggregation, the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should resolve the bug.
