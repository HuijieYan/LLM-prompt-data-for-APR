Based on the runtime values and types of variables provided, it seems that the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is caused by the handling of the `numeric_only` parameter and the data types within the DataFrame. When the aggregation function is called with certain data types (e.g., Int64), it results in a TypeError. This aligns with the GitHub issue that mentions calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be modified to handle the different data types properly, ensuring that the aggregation functions work correctly with the nullable integer data type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    # ... (remaining code)
```

In the corrected version, we've added the `convert_dtypes` method to handle the data type conversion properly, ensuring that the aggregation functions work correctly with different data types, including Int64.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `mean` aggregation function and others work as expected with nullable integer data types.
