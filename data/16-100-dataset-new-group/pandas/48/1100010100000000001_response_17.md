One potential error in the buggy function is the fact that there is an inconsistency in handling and processing data. This inconsistency might lead to incorrect results or errors in data processing and aggregation.

To fix this bug, we can apply the following strategy:
1. Remove the unnecessary complexity and improve the consistency in handling different cases of data aggregation.
2. Refactor the exception handling and aggregation logic to ensure that it's consistent and reliable across different types of data and operations.
3. Ensure that the data processing and aggregation steps follow a clear and predictable flow to avoid unexpected errors or results.

Here's the corrected version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError) as e:
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block
                if how == "ohlc":
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    # Exclude the block and continue
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

        # Process the result and aggregate the block
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update the indexes
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the exception handling has been improved to handle NotImplementedError and TypeError consistently. Additionally, the result processing and aggregation logic have been refactored to establish a clear and predictable flow for data processing and aggregation.
