The bug in the provided function is due to the safe casting of values from type 'float64' to type 'int64'. The error message 'TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'' indicates that the function is attempting to perform a safe cast from float64 to int64, which cannot be done due to non-equivalent data types.

To fix this bug, you can change the line where the values are being cast to use a different casting rule. One of the possible strategies for fixing the bug is to cast the values using `casting='unsafe'` instead of `casting='safe'`. This will allow the unsafe conversion of the values, but will avoid the error due to the non-equivalence of data types.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
  # rest of the function is unchanged
    ):
    # existing code
  
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, result)
            result = cast(pd.Series, result)._values
            try:
                # Replace the TypeError with original error
                result = result.astype(dtype, cast['unsafe'], copy=False)
            except TypeError:
                raise TypeError(
                    f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
                )
            if (result == block.values).all():
                return result
            else:
                raise TypeError(
                    f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
                )
  # remaining code is unchanged

```

In this corrected version, the line where the values are cast has been replaced with an attempt to perform the cast using `casting='unsafe'`. If the cast fails, a TypeError will be raised with an appropriate error message. If successful, the result will be returned.
