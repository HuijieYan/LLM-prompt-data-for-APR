The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. When using the new nullable integer data type, the error occurs, but it works with int64 dtype. The error does not occur when calling functions like min, max, or first, but it also occurs with median and std.

The bug seems to be in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The error occurs when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

The issue mentioned on GitHub provides detailed examples of the problem and the expected output.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the casting of values from float64 to int64 is handled properly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Rest of the function implementation...

    # Cast the result to the appropriate dtype
    if result is not no_result:
        # Ensure that result is cast properly
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)

        try:
            result = result.astype(data.dtypes[0])
        except ValueError:
            raise DataError(f"Unable to transform to {data.dtypes[0]} dtype")

        # Construct the aggregated block
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, data.items, data.ref_items)

    new_items.append(locs)
    agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function implementation...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

We need to handle the casting of result values using `maybe_convert_objects` to try float casting and then explicitly convert the result to the appropriate dtype using the `astype` method.

This should ensure that the casting of non-equivalent float64 values to int64 is handled properly, avoiding the TypeError that was being raised in the failing test cases.
