It seems like the `_cython_agg_blocks` function has an issue with casting numeric types correctly between integer and floating point. 

The error message indicates that it's trying to cast an array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe', and it raised a `TypeError` indicating that it's unable to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

This is an issue with the way it's handling the casting of data. It's trying to cast float data to integer datatype, which is not possible without handling the exceptions properly. 

To fix this error, you can change the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function in the `pandas/core/dtypes/cast.py` file. This function should handle the downcasting of numeric types more gracefully.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            pass

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:

        # we need to adjust the indexer to account for the
        # items we have removed
        # really should be done in internals :<

        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By incorporating better error handling and using the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function, this corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks` should no longer throw casting errors and should pass the failing test cases.
