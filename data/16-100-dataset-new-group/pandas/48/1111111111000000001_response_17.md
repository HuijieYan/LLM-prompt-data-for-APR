The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks()` seems to be causing some issues when applying certain aggregation functions to groups of nullable integer data.

In the `for` loop of the function, there is a lot of complex logic happening to handle group-wise aggregation of data blocks. The use of `result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(...)` in the loop is suspect. In the case where an exception is thrown, the logic after the `except` block might not be functioning as expected. 

A good strategy for fixing this issue would be to simplify the code and to handle exception scenarios more explicitly, ensuring that control flow is correctly managed.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            result = alt(obj, axis=self.axis)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please ensure to test this corrected function with the previously failing test cases to confirm it works as expected.
