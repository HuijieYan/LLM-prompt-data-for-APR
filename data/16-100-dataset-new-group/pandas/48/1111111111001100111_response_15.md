The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` can be fixed by handling the `IntegrationArray` dtype properly during aggregation. Based on the failing tests and the GitHub issue, it seems that there is an issue when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError. 

To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to handle the dtype of the data appropriately, especially when it is an `IntegrationArray`. We should make sure to cast the result back to the original dtype if feasible, and handle the aggregation operation specifically for the `IntegrationArray` type. 

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = block.values  # Get the values
        dtype = block.dtype  # Get the dtype
        if dtype == 'Int64' and how in ['mean', 'median', 'var']:
            result = result.astype(float)  # Cast to float for calculations
        else:
            result = result.astype(dtype)  # Cast back to the original dtype

        # Perform aggregation operations
        if how == 'mean':
            result = result.mean(axis=1, skipna=True)
        elif how == 'var':
            result = result.var(axis=1, ddof=1, skipna=True)
        elif how == 'median':
            result = np.median(result, axis=1)

        # Create a new Block with the calculated result
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

In this corrected version, the dtype of the values is checked before performing aggregation operations, and appropriate type handling is applied. This should fix the bug and ensure that the DataFrameGroupBy aggregation works correctly with Int64 dtype.

By incorporating these changes, the function should now correctly handle the aggregation operations for the IntegrationArray type, resolving the issues reported in the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.
