The bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely caused by the calculation of the columns' group-wise aggregation in the function. The function is supposed to aggregate the data in each group based on the specified `how` method (e.g. mean, median, var). However, it seems to be returning incorrect aggregated values. This is likely due to the incorrect calculation of the `result` variable and improper handling of locs and items during aggregation. 

To fix this bug, we can rewrite the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly in each group, resulting in the expected aggregated values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    indexer = None
    for block in data.blocks:
        values = maybe_convert_objects(block.values)
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_blocks.append(make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs))

    # Concatenate and sort the aggregated items
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        indexer = np.concatenate([indexer, blk.mgr_locs]) if indexer is not None else blk.mgr_locs
        indexer = np.argsort(indexer)

    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we iterate over each block of data, apply the aggregation using the grouper's `aggregate` method, and create new blocks with the aggregated result. We then concatenate and sort the aggregated items to return the final aggregated blocks and items.

By rewriting the function in this way, the issue with the incorrect calculation of the result should be resolved, and the function should pass the failing tests.
