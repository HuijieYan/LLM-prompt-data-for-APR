Looking at the provided buggy function, we can see that it is trying to cast float64 values to int64 using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`, but that is resulting in a TypeError due to the type mismatch. This error occurs when the function is trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64. 

To fix the issue, the `safe_cast` function can be adjusted to handle such type casting errors and provide a more suitable error message. Then, the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` should be updated to use this adjusted `safe_cast` function.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous loop logic)
        
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            try:
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            except TypeError:
                # cannot safely cast non-equivalent values to the desired dtype
                raise TypeError(
                    f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {block.values.dtype} to {np.dtype(result.dtype)}"
                )

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                # (1, N) case can occur if block.values was Categorical
                #  and result is ndarray[object]
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    # Cast back if feasible
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining logic of the function)
```

In the corrected version, the type casting logic has been updated to use `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` which handles such type casting errors and provides a more suitable error message as per the earlier approach. This corrected logic should resolve the type mismatch error when trying to cast float64 to int64.

In summary, the correction involved enhancing the type casting part of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle non-equivalent value types exceptions properly. This revised implementation should resolve the previous type casting issues.
