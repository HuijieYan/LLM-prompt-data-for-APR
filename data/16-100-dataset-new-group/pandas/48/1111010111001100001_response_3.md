Based on the analysis of the provided test cases, the issue within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function appears to be related to the aggregation process, particularly when handling nullable integer data types. The `numeric_only` parameter is set to `True`, so the function is expected to only operate on numeric data. However, when dealing with nullable integers in the DataFrame, the function is not handling them correctly, resulting in the failing tests.

To fix the bug, it would be beneficial to modify the aggregation logic to properly handle nullable integer data types.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Reset the mgr_locs for each block
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset+loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated version includes a conversion of the data to numeric type using `data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)`, and also streamlines the aggregation process.

By employing these changes, the corrected function should be able to handle nullable integer data types appropriately and resolve the failing tests.
