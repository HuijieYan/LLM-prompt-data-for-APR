I have analyzed the buggy function and identified potential error locations. The buggy function appears to be failing to handle and aggregate the data blocks properly, resulting in issues related to the management of the locational information and the splitting of object-dtype blocks.

The cause of the bug seems to be related to improper handling of the locational information and errors in the special handling of exception cases.

To fix the bug, I would suggest revising the logic of managing locational information and improving the exception handling to ensure proper aggregation of the data blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the given function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Get data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    index_dtype = np.object_  # Set the default dtype for indexing

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        try:
            result, index_dtype = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, locs=locs, index_dtype=index_dtype
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Generally if we have numeric_only=False and non-applicable functions, try to use alternate aggregation method
            if alt is None:
                # No alternate aggregation method available, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            # Call the alternate aggregation method
            obj = self.obj._take_with_is_copy(locs, axis=self.axis)
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            if result._data.shape[1] == 1:
                result = result.iloc[:, 0]

            # Reshape the result array if needed
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            if result.ndim == 1:
                result = result[:, None]

        # Create a new block for the aggregated result
        agg_block = make_block(result, locs, ndim=1, placement=locs)
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, I have revised the logic for managing locational information and addressed the exception handling to ensure proper aggregation of the data blocks. I have also added support for handling index_dtype to maintain consistency in the dtype of locational information.
