### Analysis
The `TypeError` indicates a problem when casting array values from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'. This error occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function after grouping data with the `GroupBy` method in the `pandas` library. The GitHub issue further confirms that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`.

### Bug Identification
The bug seems to be caused by an improper cast of array values from `float64` to `int64` when calling the `mean` method after grouping with `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Cause
The `TypeError` arises from an incorrect type casting operation due to the combination of `float64` and `int64` dtype values when applying the `mean` function to a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the type casting operation is compatible with the input data, specifically when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function after grouping with `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = maybe_convert_objects(data).get_numeric_data(copy=False)  # Use maybe_convert_objects

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected version, the `maybe_convert_objects` function is used to ensure that the data is properly converted to the appropriate format for calculations. This should address the issue of incorrect type casting and resolve the bug. After applying this fix, the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should work as intended when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` function after grouping with `Int64` dtype.
