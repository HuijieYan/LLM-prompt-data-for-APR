The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is that it is not handling the grouped data correctly. The `mgr_locs` attribute of a `Block` object is used to determine the location of the block within the `BlockManager`, and it needs to be correctly updated after the aggregation operation. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in handling different block types such as `IntegerArray` and `FloatBlock` which are not being handled consistently.

The function fails for all test cases with different values for `how` because it does not correctly aggregate the data based on the specified function.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be updated to correctly aggregate the data based on the provided `how` parameter and update the `mgr_locs` attribute of the `Block` objects to reflect the new position within the `BlockManager`. Additionally, the different block types should be handled consistently.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        
        # Perform aggregation based on the specified function
        if how in ['mean', 'median', 'var']:
            result = block.apply_agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, alt=alt)
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError(f"Aggregation method '{how}' not supported")

        # Convert the result to the original dtype and get the aggregated block
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No data to aggregate")

    # Update block locations
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(offset, offset + loc, 1))
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, I have added a proper condition to handle different aggregation methods, updated the `mgr_locs` attribute for each block based on the aggregation, and handled the resulting blocks consistently.

With these changes, the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now pass the failing test cases for different `how` values.
