The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function likely stems from issues with the aggregation process and the dtype conversion, as seen in the failing test cases. The main problem seems to be with the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function, which may not be handling the conversion correctly with the `Int64` data type. To fix this, we can try modifying the process of handling the data type conversion and potentially bypassing the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function for the `Int64` data type.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            try:
                result = alt(block.values, axis=self.axis)
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

        # Handling the result
        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype == 'Int64':
                result_dtype = 'float64'
            else:
                result_dtype = block.dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_dates=True, copy=False)

            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs, klass=FloatBlock, ndim=2, dtype=np.dtype(result_dtype))
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (other parts of the original function)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we are explicitly handling the `Int64` data type in the aggregation process and ensuring that the result dtype is properly cast to `float64`. We also bypass the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function for the `Int64` data type, and use `make_block` to create the aggregation block with the correct dtype.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test cases and resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
