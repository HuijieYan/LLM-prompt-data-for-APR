The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the aggregation process, where the implementation differs from the expected behavior of the `groupby` operation. The output of the function, especially the `agg_blocks`, is incorrect, causing the failing tests.

The cause of the issue seems to be the aggregation logic inside the `for` loop, where the `Block.values` are aggregated based on the `how` parameter. The handling of the aggregation doesn't conform to the expected behavior of the `groupby` function, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can modify the aggregation logic to correctly perform the aggregation based on the values within each group.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Construct the result based on the aggregated blocks
    result_items = []
    for item in new_items:
        result_items.extend(item)

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(result_items)
```

This corrected function eliminates handling of special cases during aggregation and relies on the standard groupby aggregation to produce the correct result.

Make sure to verify this correction against a larger set of test cases to confirm that the corrected function behaves as expected.
