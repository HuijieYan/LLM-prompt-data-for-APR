## Bug Analysis
The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object where the underlying `DataFrame` has nullable integer data type (`Int64`). The issue seems to be related to casting from float64 to int64 when performing the aggregation.

The error message indicates that the bug occurs during an attempt to safely cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, resulting in a `TypeError`.

## Bug Location
The bug is most likely occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, particularly during the casting of float64 to int64 for aggregation.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for cases where the aggregation process involves casting data from float64 to int64.
2. Handle the casting operation in a way that correctly deals with nullable integer (Int64) data types.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Original function body remains the same

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other code)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, obj.values)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)

            # Correctly handle nullable integer dtype
            try:
                cast_result = result.astype(block.dtype)
            except TypeError as err:
                casted = result.astype(block.dtype, copy=False)
                if (casted == result).all():
                    result = casted
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {block.dtype}"
                    ) from err
            else:
                result = cast_result

            # Check for split blocks and adjustments
            if block.is_extension and result.ndim == 1 and not result.shape[1] == 1:
                # Handling cases where we've split an object block
                # Adjust the code accordingly

        # ... (other code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that the corrected version is a partial code snippet and should be integrated into the existing `_cython_agg_blocks` method. This fix considers the correct handling of nullable integer data types during the casting operation for aggregation.
