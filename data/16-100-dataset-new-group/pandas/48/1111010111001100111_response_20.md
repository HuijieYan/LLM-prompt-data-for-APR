The issue appears to be related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object that contains columns with the `Int64` dtype. This results in a `TypeError`. The issue is reproduced by creating a DataFrame with nullable integer data and then calling `groupby` followed by the `mean` function.

The problem seems to arise when the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is executed, as it is responsible for aggregating the data. It appears that certain operations, such as mean, median, and var, lead to a TypeError when called on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype data.

To fix this bug, a potential strategy would be to add a specific case within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the aggregation for columns with nullable integer dtype. This might involve creating a custom aggregation method for nullable integer data, ensuring that it handles the aggregation calculations in a way that doesn't result in a TypeError.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Handle nullable integer dtype specifically
        if block.dtype.name == "Int64":
            result = block.to_numpy()
            result = getattr(result, how)(axis=1, skipna=True)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        else:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the rest of the cases
                # ...
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, a specific case is added to handle the aggregation for nullable integer dtype. This should help resolve the TypeError when applying aggregate functions like mean, median, and var.

It's important to thoroughly test this fix to ensure that it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread and that it doesn't introduce any regressions for other use cases.
