The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing due to the inability to cast an array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. The error occurs when trying to cast a float array to an integer array which is detected by the `safe_cast` function.

To fix this bug:
1. Ensure that the data remains in a standard format throughout the process.
2. Validate the data type compatibility to avoid errors when casting from float to integer or vice versa.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Convert to float if needed
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:

        # Perform the aggregation and keep data in a standard format
        groups = self.grouper.size()
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        
        if block.dtype == "Int64" and result.dtype == "float64":
            result = result.astype('Int64')

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By ensuring that the data remains consistent and validating the data type compatibility, this should resolve the issue of failing to cast from float to integer.
