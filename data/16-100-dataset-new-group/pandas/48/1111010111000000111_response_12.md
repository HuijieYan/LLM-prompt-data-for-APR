To address the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to modify the exception handling, cast the results, and handle object blocks properly. The issue is caused by an error in handling the outcome of the aggregation operation within the function. In this case, the function is failing to handle the `mean` operation on nullable integer data types, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we will need to implement error handling for different aggregation functions and properly cast the results to resolve the issue. Additionally, we should address the handling of object blocks to ensure that the execution does not result in an error.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
      
        try:
            if alt is not None and isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values if len(result._data.blocks) == 1 else result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        except (TypeError, ValueError):
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        block_dtype = block.dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block_dtype)
        new_items.append(locs)

        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if deleted_items:
        # Handle any deleted items
        merged_deleted_items = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = self._get_indexer(data.items, merged_deleted_items)
        agg_blocks, new_items = self._handle_deleted_items(agg_blocks, new_items, indexer)

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

The corrected function introduces proper error handling during the aggregation process, casting of results, and management of deleted items. The amendments should ensure the function operates correctly and resolves the TypeError encountered when calling the `mean` operation on nullable integer data types.
