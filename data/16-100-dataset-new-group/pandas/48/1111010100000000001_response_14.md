Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. There are multiple assignments in the function, and it's not clear what is being assigned to what variable in some cases.
2. The exception handling seems to be written in a way that may not be catching all the possible exceptions.
3. Some variables seem to be used before being assigned, or potentially being reassigned without proper reset.
4. There is a block of code that is not clear about its purpose and its flow.

Cause of the bug using the buggy function:
The bug in the function seems to be caused by improper handling of exceptions and potentially incorrect variable assignments. In addition, the flow of some of the conditional statements is not clear, leading to potential issues with the logic.

Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Clearly define the flow of the function and the purpose of each block of code.
2. Ensure that the exception handling is comprehensive and captures all possible error scenarios.
3. Explicitly initialize and reset all variables before using them.
4. Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
