The issue with the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be related to the implementation of the block aggregation logic. The function is trying to aggregate blocks of data based on certain criteria, but there are potential error locations within the function that could lead to data misalignment and unexpected outcomes.

Upon analyzing the code, the primary causes of the bug seem to be related to data splitting and unexpected transformations in the aggregation process. The exception handling and conditional branching also add complexity to the function's logic and might contribute to the bug.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to simplify the logic of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and reduce the use of exception handling for control flow. Additionally, it's important to ensure proper alignment of aggregated blocks and handle data splitting in a more predictable and straightforward manner.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, with simplified logic:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._astype_nans_if_datetimelike()._convert(datetime=False, numeric_only=True)

    if len(data.blocks) == 0:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
    result_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        values = block.values
        if len(values) == 0:
            raise DataError("No data to aggregate")
        
        if isinstance(values, Block):
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Cannot perform the operation in an alternate way")
            else:
                result = alt(values, axis=1)
        
        result_blocks.append(make_block(result))

    return result_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, the function starts by fetching data to aggregate. It then checks if the data should be restricted to numeric types and handles potential errors with an empty data check. The aggregation logic is simplified, ensuring that non-numeric types are handled appropriately and any alternate strategies for aggregation are applied as needed.

By simplifying the logic, reducing exceptions, and handling empty data cases, the function should produce more predictable and reliable results while aggregating the blocks of data.
