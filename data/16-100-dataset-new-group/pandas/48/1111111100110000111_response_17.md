Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the safe casting error when attempting to operate on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. This issue was reported in a GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError". The issue arose from using the nullable integer data type and calling mean after grouping, which resulted in a TypeError.

The error message suggests that there is an issue with safely casting non-equivalent float64 to int64 when trying to perform the specified operation.

To address this bug, one possible approach could be to review the _cython_agg_blocks method's inner workings, particularly where it interacts with the safe_cast function. Ensuring that the internal process of casting from float64 to int64 is handled appropriately and without any loss of precision is crucial.

Here's a corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function that takes into consideration the safe casting requirements and ensures that numeric values from different data types are handled appropriately:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Remaining code to fetch and process data
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result

        # Code to handle aggregation based on data blocks

        if result is not no_result:
            # Add safe cast condition to handle casting from float64 to int64
            try:
                result = values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
            except TypeError as err:
                casted = values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)
                if (casted == values).all():
                    return casted
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {values.dtype} to {np.dtype(dtype)}"
                    ) from err

        # Remaining code to process aggregations

    # Remaining code to process aggregated blocks and items
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised version ensures that when an exception is raised during the cast operation, it falls back to check if the casted values are equivalent, providing a safer approach to casting non-equivalent data types.

It is important to ensure that this corrects the TypeError reported in the GitHub issue where the mean operation on a DataFrameGroupBy resulted in a TypeError when using Int64 dtype, and verify that the corrected function provides the expected output.
