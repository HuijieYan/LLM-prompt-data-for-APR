The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has issues with handling nullable integer data. The `TypeError` exception is preventing successful aggregation for nullable integer data types, causing the failing tests.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data properly by converting it to `float` before performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Convert nullable integer data to float to avoid TypeError
    data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle nullable integer data properly and pass the failing tests.
