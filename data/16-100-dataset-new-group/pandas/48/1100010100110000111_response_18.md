## Analysis
The error occurs when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The error message indicates that there is a problem with casting from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'. This issue has been identified in pandas version 1.0.1.

## Bug Location
The error is occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. It seems that the function is unable to handle the casting from `float64` to `int64` for the grouped data.

## Cause of Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function does not handle the safe casting from `float64` to `int64` for the grouped data when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix this bug, you would need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that safe casting from `float64` to `int64` is handled correctly when calling aggregation functions on grouped data.

## Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    ...

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype.kind in ["f", "u"]:
                result = result.astype(block.dtype, copy=False)
            split_array.append(result)

    # combine the results
    if agg_numbers:
        result_blocks = _simple_blockify(agg_numbers, items=new_items, klass=Block)
        for blk in result_blocks:
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer_manager
        result_blocks.extend(agg_group_columns)

    return result_blocks, new_items
```

This corrected version aims to handle safe casting from `float64` to `int64` in cases where the result is an ndarray of kind 'f' or 'u'. After applying the correction, the function should handle the aggregation of grouped data with the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions without TypeError caused by the problem in casting.
