The issue with the buggy `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to the data processing and aggregation logic.

After analyzing the function and its relationship with the test code, it seems that the `DataFrame` object used for testing is not getting processed properly during aggregation, resulting in failed test cases for functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

The cause of the bug is most likely related to the data type handling and aggregation operations when a nullable integer type (`Int64`) is used.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve checking the data type conversions and handling for nullable integers during aggregation, ensuring that the aggregation results are correctly calculated and returned as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True)

    # Perform the aggregation
    agg_blocks, agg_items = data.aggregate(how, alt=alt, min_count=min_count)

    if not (agg_blocks or agg_items):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this corrected version, the `DataFrame` should be properly processed and aggregated, and the test cases for functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` should pass successfully.
