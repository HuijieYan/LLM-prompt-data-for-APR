After analyzing the runtime values and types of variables in the given buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the use of the `ExtensionBlock` when handling nullable integer (`Int64`) data types in the `DataFrameGroupBy.mean()` method. 

The bug appears to occur when calling the `mean()` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer (`Int64`) data type, resulting in a `TypeError` when aggregating the data. This issue is consistent with the GitHub problem description provided, where operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std` result in the same error.

To fix this bug, it is recommended to check for and handle nullable integer data types specifically within the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function, especially when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and standard deviation.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... other variable initializations

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.values.dtype):
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle other exceptions as before
            
        # ... other processing steps for aggregation

    # ... handle other steps for aggregation and return results as before
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly check if the data type of `block.values` is nullable integer (`Int64`) using `pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype()`. If the data type is nullable integer, perform the aggregation using a specific handling strategy for these data types. Otherwise, follow the regular aggregation flow.

By adding this check and handling strategy, we aim to address the issue caused by calling aggregation operations on nullable integer data types in the `DataFrameGroupBy.mean()` and related methods.

This correction should resolve the `TypeError` issue and enable the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function to handle the nullable integer data types appropriately during aggregation operations, ultimately passing the failing tests and addressing the problem described in the GitHub issue.
