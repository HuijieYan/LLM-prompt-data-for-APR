There are several issues with the provided function, some of which include:
1. Confusing variable names: The function uses variable names like `how`, `alt`, `locs`, `data`, and `result`, making it challenging to understand the logic within the function.
2. Mutability: The function modifies both `agg_blocks` and `new_items` lists within a loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
3. Exception handling: The function handles exceptions using `assert` statements, which are not suitable for exception handling.
4. Complex logic: The function's implementation is complex and difficult to follow, reducing its maintainability.

To fix the bugs, a suggested strategy would be to:
1. Rename the variables to more descriptive names to improve readability.
2. Avoid modifying the lists while iterating over them.
3. Use proper exception handling to catch and handle exceptions.
4. Simplify the logic to make it more understandable.

Below is the corrected version of the function:
