The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function causes a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with an `Int64` dtype. The issue has been reported on GitHub with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

After analyzing the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug lies in the handling of nullable integers when calling aggregation functions such as `mean`, `median`, or `var` on a grouped DataFrame.

Based on the runtime input/output values and the GitHub issue, the cause of the bug appears to be related to the handling of nullable integers in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It results in a `TypeError` when using mean, median, or var functions with grouped DataFrames that contain columns with nullable integer dtype.

To fix the bug, the handling of nullable integers needs to be corrected in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to accommodate these types of data. This may involve adjusting the logic in the function to correctly handle nullable integer data when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to address the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Updated logic to handle nullable integer dtype
    if self.obj.dtypes.all() == 'Int64' and alt is None:
        alt = np.nan

    agg_dict = {col: how for col in data.columns}
    result = data.agg(agg_dict)

    agg_block = make_block(result.values, result.index, result.columns)

    return [agg_block], result.index
```

This corrected version handles the nullable integer dtype by setting `alt` to `np.nan` when necessary and then using the DataFrame's `agg` method to calculate the desired aggregation. After these adjustments, the function should be able to handle nullable integer dtypes properly and resolve the reported issue on GitHub.
