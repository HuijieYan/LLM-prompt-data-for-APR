## Issue Analysis
The issue is related to calling the `mean` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object when the data type of the column is `Int64`. This error occurs for `mean`, `median`, `var`, and `std` operations. The expected behavior is to return the mean of the grouped data. This bug was reported in a GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

## Identified Potential Error Locations
The bug likely originates from the interaction between the `_cython_agg_blocks` function defined in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` and the `mean` aggregation operation on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` data type. The error handling and casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function might be leading to the `TypeError` issue.

## Explanation of the Bug
The bug is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` data type. This issue arises from the inability to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` according to the casting rule 'safe'. The error message indicates that the values are being cast using the `astype` method and are failing due to non-equivalence.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The strategy to fix the bug would involve examining the data type casting and aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the aggregation operations with `Int64` data type do not result in type casting issues. This could involve refining the casting logic and handling the interaction between different data types more effectively.

## Fix for the Bug
The fixed version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below. The fix involves modifying the logic for handling non-equivalent data types and casting to ensure the aggregation operations with `Int64` data type do not result in type casting issues.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing implementation

    # ... [existing implementation]

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing implementation

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        except NotImplementedError:
            # Existing implementation

        except TypeError:
            # Handle exception caused by type casting issues
            if block.dtype.name == 'Int64' and how in ['mean', 'median', 'var', 'std']:
                # Handle casting for specific operations
                result = block.values.astype(float)
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )

            else:
                raise  # Re-raise the original TypeError

        # ... [existing implementation]

    # ... [existing implementation]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the fixed function,
- If the dtype of block is 'Int64' and the operation is 'mean', 'median', 'var', or 'std', it explicitly converts the block values to `float` data type and then performs the aggregation operation.
- For all other cases, it falls back to the existing logic for aggregation.

This updated logic should resolve the type casting issue and ensure that the `mean`, `median`, `var`, and `std` operations work correctly on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with `Int64` data type. This should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
