## Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with other components

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of `GroupBy`. The purpose of this function is to aggregate data within the specified groups. The function retrieves the data to be aggregated by calling the `_get_data_to_aggregate` method and then performs the aggregation operation. The detected errors within the function may be the cause of it malfunctioning.

### Identified potential error locations within the buggy function

1. The attempt to apply aggregation to nullable integers and convert the result to a float may have issues.
2. The logic for handling split blocks and frames might be incorrect.
3. The error handling mechanism when an operation is not implemented (e.g. `NotImplementedError`) might not be handling exceptions properly and leading to erroneous outcomes.

### Explaining the cause of the bug

The failing test is designed to check the behavior of applying aggregation functions to nullable integer data. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is not handling this scenario correctly, leading to failing tests.

### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug

1. Review the logic for handling both nullable integers and non-nullable data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. Ensure that the exception handling mechanism is implemented correctly for cases where operations are not implemented.
3. Validate the logic for handling the split blocks and frames to confirm that it works as expected.

### Corrected version of the buggy function

```python
# Buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code, may need modification

    # Below is an example of a possible correction, but more detailed investigation is needed
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Rest of the function...
```

The correction should also include a review and potential modification of the subsequent logic for handling the results of the aggregation operation, especially when dealing with nullable integer data and split blocks/frames.

Further in-depth analysis is required to provide a more accurate corrected version of the function.
