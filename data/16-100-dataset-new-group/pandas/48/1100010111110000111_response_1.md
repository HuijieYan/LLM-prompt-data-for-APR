The issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to the way it handles nullable integer data types when calculating aggregations using the `groupby` method. The error message indicates a TypeError related to casting an array from dtype `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'. This suggests that there are issues with dtype handling and casting when performing aggregations with nullable integer data types.

Since the error occurs specifically when calling `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions, it could be related to how these particular functions handle nullable integer data types when calculating the aggregations.

To fix the bug, we should review the data casting and dtype handling within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Additionally, we should ensure that the handling of nullable integer data types and the casting to other dtypes is done in a way that aligns with the expected behavior of these aggregations with nullable integers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                if len(result.columns) != 1:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

                result = result.iloc[:, 0]

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version of the function, the conversion of data to numeric types has been replaced with `.convert_dtypes()` to handle nullable integer data types appropriately. Additionally, the handling of the result and aggregation has been updated to ensure that the dtype conversion is done correctly for the aggregated data.

This should resolve the TypeError related to casting between float64 and int64 and ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types during the aggregations.
