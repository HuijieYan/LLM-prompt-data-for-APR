The bug likely arises from incorrect adjustment of values after performing a grouped aggregation operation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. To fix the bug, the correct offset for adjusting the indexer after removing items needs to be calculated. The correct ordering of blocks and items for aggregation should also be handled properly.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    ...
    # existing code

    if deleted_items:
        # adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
        # calculate the correct offset for adjusting the indexer after removing items
        offset = 0
        for i in range(len(deleted_items)):
            deleted_items[i] = np.argwhere(np.isin(indexer, deleted_items[i]))
        for d in deleted_items:
            indexer[d] -= (offset + np.searchsorted(indexer[offset:], d) - 1)
            offset += len(d)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    # existing code
    ...
```

This corrected version of the function should properly handle the indexer adjustment for deleted items and ensure the correct offset for reordering items during block aggregation. This should address the bug and ensure that the failing tests pass.
