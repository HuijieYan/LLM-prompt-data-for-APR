## Identifying the bug

The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The bug causes a TypeError when calling the `mean` function after grouping with the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) but works with the regular integer data type (`int64`). The bug also occurs with other functions such as `median` and `std` but not with `min`, `max`, or `first`.

## Potential error locations

The bug might be in the logic related to handling nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Cause of the bug

The bug is likely caused by the function's inability to properly handle nullable integer data types and might be related to how the underlying data is aggregated specifically for nullable integers.

## Strategy for fixing the bug

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would be to enhance the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer data types and ensure that the aggregation operations work correctly for these data types.

## Bug Fix

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Check for nullable integer data type
    if data._is_integer_dtype and data._is_nullable_integer_dtype:
        data = data.convert_to_int()
    
    # Performing aggregation operation
    try:
        agg_blocks = data._agg(how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
    except (TypeError, SpecificationError):
        raise SpecificationError(f"Aggregation function '{how}' not supported for nullable integer data type")

    return agg_blocks
```

In this corrected version, we handle the special case of nullable integers by converting them to regular integers before performing the aggregation operation. Additionally, a specific error is raised if the aggregation function is not supported for nullable integer data types.

This correction aims to properly handle nullable integer data types during aggregation and improves the functionality for these data types, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
