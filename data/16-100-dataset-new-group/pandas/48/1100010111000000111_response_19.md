Based on the failing test and the GitHub issue, it seems there is a bug related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, which results in a TypeError. The bug is related to the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The issue was reported on GitHub with the detailed problem description and expected output.

The bug seems to be occurring due to a problem in handling the nullable integer datatype in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug would be to ensure that the computation of the mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype works as expected, without resulting in a TypeError.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, numeric_only, min_count)
        agg_block, locs = self._handle_result(block, result, alt)
        if agg_block is not not_result:
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Prepare the final output
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
    for i, block in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc_size = len(block.mgr_locs)
        block.mgr_locs = np.arange(len(data))[
            np.concatenate(new_items).searchsorted(block.mgr_locs)
        ]
        if loc_size != len(block.mgr_locs):
            raise SpecificationError(
                "cython_agg_blocks: Number of mgr_locs changed during aggregation"
            )

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function now includes separate calls to `_aggregate_block` and `_handle_result` to ensure that the computation of the mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype is correctly handled. Additionally, the final output is prepared by updating the `agg_items` and `mgr_locs` accordingly.

This corrected version should address the bug and ensure that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype works as expected.
