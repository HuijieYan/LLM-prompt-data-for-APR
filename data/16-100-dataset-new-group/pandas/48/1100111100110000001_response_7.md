The given error message traces back to a TypeError raised while the section of the buggy function is trying to safely cast a float64 array to an int64 array. The error originates in the function `safe_cast` in the file `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` at this line:
```python
values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
```
The error is due to the fact that the given float64 array can't be safely cast to an int64 array, resulting in the `TypeError` being raised.

Upon further inspection, the bug seems to be related to the casting of the `float64` values to `int64` inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The error is not due to the data or the inputs, but rather the algorithm of safe casting from float to integer.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure a safe cast of the `float64` values to `int64` by handling the casting behavior accurately. Therefore, it's important to inspect the implementation of the `safe_cast` function to improve the typecasting behavior.

Here's the corrected implementation for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with appropriate error handling for the data type conversion:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code goes here

    # New code to handle safe data type casting
    try:
        values = data.values.astype(int)  # Convert the values to int type
    except Exception as e:
        raise DataError(f"Failed to cast data to int type: {str(e)}") from e

    # Existing code goes here
```

In the provided code block, a `try` block has been added to handle the data type casting of `float64` to `int64`. An explicit conversion to integer is attempted and an exception is raised with relevant details if the casting fails.

The above changes should enable safe casting of the data and prevent the TypeError caused by unsafe typecasting during aggregation operations. After applying these changes, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should correctly handle the type casting of the data to avoid producing the TypeError raised previously, resolving the bug.
