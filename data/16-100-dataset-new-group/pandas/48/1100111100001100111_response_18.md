## Bug Analysis
The bug causes a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype. The bug is reproducible when calling other aggregation functions like `median` and `std` as well.

From the runtime values and types of variables and the GitHub issue, it is clear that the bug is related to the dtype `Int64`, and the specific arithmetic operations such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` when performed on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

The bug occurs within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically due to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations on the DataFrameGroupBy object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
The bug needs to be addressed by appropriately handling the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations on the DataFrameGroupBy object. Specifically, the aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` need to be updated to handle nullable integer data type appropriately.

Additionally, the function should be updated to cover edge cases such as callable `alt` being None and the need for robust error handling for unsupported operations.

## Bug Fix

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    # New code block to check for nullable integer data type
    if data._is_view and hasattr(data._mgr, "_box_arrs"):
        if data._mgr._box_arrs:
            # Replace nullable integer data with NaN for aggregation
            for i, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
                if block.is_object or issubclass(block.dtype.type, pd.Int64Dtype):
                    new_block = block.astype("float64")
                    data.blocks[i] = new_block
                    block = new_block
    
    # Carry out original logic for aggregation operations
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The updated code block checks for the presence of nullable integer data within the input DataFrame, and if found, replaces it with NaN to handle aggregation operations appropriately. This fix covers the specific issue related to the bug identified in the GitHub issue.

After applying this fix, the function should correctly handle aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std` on DataFrameGroupBy objects with nullable integer data type.
