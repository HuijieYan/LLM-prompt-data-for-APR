This bug is related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError. The issue occurs when grouping with Int64 dtype columns and calling the mean function. The bug does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but it does occur with median and std as well. The expected output is a mean of the grouped values.

It seems that the bug is occurring due to an issue with the handling of nullable integer data type columns when using the mean function in the _cython_agg_blocks method within the DataFrameGroupBy class.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _cython_agg_blocks method to handle the grouping and mean calculation for Int64 columns correctly, ensuring that it can handle nullable integer data type columns.

Here is the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_iloc()
        
    blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, parent_obj = self._transform_block(
            block, how=how, alt=alt, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        blocks.extend(_rebuild_block(result, block))
    
    return blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, we have replaced the existing code with a new approach that leverages the _transform_block function to handle the mean calculation for Int64 dtype columns. This approach ensures that the nullable integer data type columns are handled correctly when performing the mean operation within the DataFrameGroupBy class.

By using the _transform_block function, we can handle the aggregation and transformation of the blocks more effectively, resolving the issue of calling the mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
