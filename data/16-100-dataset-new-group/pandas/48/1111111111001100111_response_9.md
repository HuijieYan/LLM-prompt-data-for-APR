The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing a TypeError when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.

Upon reviewing the code and the failing tests, it appears that the bug lies within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function where the TypeError is occurring when trying to perform aggregation operations with the `Int64` dtype.

To fix the bug, it's important to handle the `Int64` dtype correctly during the aggregation process to avoid the TypeError. This can be achieved by ensuring that the `Int64` dtype is properly accounted for and that the operations are carried out in a way that is compatible with this datatype.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should resolve the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        if isinstance(block.values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray):
            # The block has Int64 dtype
            values = block.values.to_numpy(na_sentinel=np.nan)
            result = getattr(values, how)(axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            values_arr = pd.arrays.IntegerArray(result, dtype="Int64")
            agg_block = block.make_block(values_arr)
        else:
            # Perform the aggregation as normal
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in data.blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this corrected version, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now properly handle the `Int64` dtype during aggregation and avoid the TypeError that was occurring.

Please verify this corrected version with the failing tests to ensure that it resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
