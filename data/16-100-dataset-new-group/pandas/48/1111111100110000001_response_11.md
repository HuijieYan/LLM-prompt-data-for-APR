The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` likely contains a bug that is causing the TypeError during the cast operation. The error message indicates that casting a float array to an integer array failed. The function appears to be performing aggregation operations on data blocks but is failing to handle the numeric data types correctly, resulting in the cast error.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully identifying the point in the code where the type casting is occurring and ensuring that the correct data type is used.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data(copy=False)  # Fixed method name

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (previous code)
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_datetime=True)  # Change maybe_downcast_numeric to maybe_convert_objects
            agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs, klass=block.__class__, ndim=2)  # Changed make_block arguments
            new_items.extend(block.items)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

The changes made include:
1. Corrected the method name from `data.get_numeric_data` to `data._get_numeric_data`.
2. Changed the function call to `maybe_convert_objects` instead of `maybe_downcast_numeric` to handle the conversion of objects, including datetime.
3. Modified the arguments passed to `make_block` to correctly create the aggregation block from the result.

By making these changes, the function should now handle the numeric and other data types correctly, making sure that the result is properly processed and casted without causing the TypeError.
