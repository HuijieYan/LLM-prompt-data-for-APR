The code for the buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is difficult to analyze because it has a lot of dependencies, and it calls several functions that might be causing the errors experienced in the failing test cases. The error originates in the `safe_cast` function located in `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` and was called from a function in a related part of the code.

To fix the bug, we should review the `safe_cast` function's use of the `astype` method and how it handles the casting of values. It's likely that there is an issue with casting the inferred float dtypes to an integer dtype, causing the `safe_cast` function to raise a TypeError exception.

Let's proceed to change how values are converted and casted in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's the fixed version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function with inline comments:
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other code)

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # handle dtype conversion
        if isinstance(block.values, (pd.Int64Dtype, np.integer)):
            if isinstance(result, (float, np.floating)):
                # Convert the result to match the dtype of the block
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)

        # ... (other code)

    # ... (other code)
```

In this fixed version, we check if the block values are of integer type (`pd.Int64Dtype` or `np.integer`). If that's the case and the result type is a float, we convert the result to match the dtype of the block before processing any further.

By explicitly checking the block values' type and handling the conversion, we anticipate avoiding the TypeError exception in the `safe_cast` function.

This should address the issue and correct the failing test cases. After applying this fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be able to handle the dtype conversion correctly and pass the failing test cases.
