Based on the bug and the provided function, it seems that there is an issue with handling nullable integer data type when calling the `mean` function after grouping. This results in a TypeError.

A potential error location for the issue might be within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where the data is aggregated for numeric types. It seems that the function is not properly handling the nullable integer data type when aggregating the data.

The bug might be caused by the function not being able to handle the transformation of nullable integer data type when performing aggregation. This results in a TypeError when calling the `mean` function after grouping.

One strategy for fixing the bug would be to check for the nullable integer data type specifically and handle it appropriately within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This would involve identifying the nullable integer data type and applying the aggregation operation accordingly to avoid the TypeError.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to resolve the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)  # New helper function
        if result is None:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        if result._data.shape[1] != 1:
            raise NotImplementedError("Something went wrong")

        agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, 0]._data.blocks[0])
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust indexes for deleted items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items


def _aggregate_block(self, block, how, alt, min_count):
    locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
    obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)

    if block.dtype == 'Int64' and how == "mean":
        result = s.aggregate(lambda x: x.mean(numeric_only=True))
    else:
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except Exception as e:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue
    return result
```

In the corrected version, a new helper function `_aggregate_block` is introduced to handle the aggregation of data. Within this helper function, a check is added to handle nullable integer data type specifically when performing the `mean` aggregation. Additionally, the handling of deleted items and adjustment of indexes are also updated to ensure proper aggregation and indexing.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug and allow the `mean` function to work properly with nullable integer data type when calling after grouping.
