The issue reported on GitHub indicates that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with the `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError. This issue occurs when calling other functions such as median and std as well. The expected output of the `mean` function on the provided example is to display the mean values for each group.

The potential error location is in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, as it deals with the aggregation of data and might be encountering an issue with the `Int64` dtype.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the handling of the `Int64` dtype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The error occurs when trying to perform certain aggregations on the `Int64` dtype data, resulting in a TypeError. This is likely due to the function not handling the `Int64` dtype as expected.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to properly handle the `Int64` dtype when performing aggregations. This may involve checking for the dtype and implementing specific handling for `Int64` dtype during aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Process each block
        # ... (previous block processing code)

        # Check if the data type is Int64
        if block.dtype.type == np.int64:
            # Convert the block values to float64 for aggregation
            block = block.astype("float64")

        # Perform aggregation
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Handle the result and add it to agg_blocks

    # Handle other cases and return agg_blocks and agg_items
```

In the corrected version, before performing aggregation, we check if the data type of the block is `Int64` and if so, convert the block values to `float64` for aggregation. This approach ensures that the aggregation methods can handle the `Int64` dtype without encountering a TypeError.
