To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to handle the case where the input DataFrame has nullable integer data type (`Int64`). This issue has been reported on GitHub and the problem is that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError.

### Analysis
The bug is likely occurring due to the handling of nullable integer data type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically when aggregating using the `mean` function.

### Error Locations in the Buggy Function
The error is likely occurring when handling the `Int64` dtype and attempting to aggregate using the `mean` function in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function does not handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly when performing aggregation operations like `mean`.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to correctly handle the aggregation operations for nullable integer data types. We should ensure that the mean operation is performed accurately when the `Int64` dtype is present in the input DataFrame.

### Corrected Version
The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly and perform the aggregation operations accurately.

One potential way to fix the bug is to use `pd.NA` as a marker for missing values and handle it appropriately in the aggregation process.

Here's a possible corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:
```python
# Import relevant libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Other imports from the original function remain the same ...

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # ... (other parts of the existing implementation)

    # New implementation to handle nullable integer data type (Int64)
    for block in data.blocks:
        if np.issubdtype(block.values.dtype, np.integer):
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.values):
                result = getattr(block.values, how)(axis=1, skipna=True, min_count=min_count)
                # Replace pd.NA with np.nan in integer dtype blocks
                result = np.where(result == pd.NA, np.nan, result)
                result = np.nanmean(result)
                agg_block: Block = make_block(result, klass=Block)

            else:
                # Non-integer dtype blocks
                try:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                        block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
                # Handle other cases
                # ...

        else:
            # Handle non-integer dtype blocks
            # ...

    # ... (remaining implementation)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we handle the cases where the input data has nullable integer data type (Int64) by converting `pd.NA` to `np.nan` and then performing the mean operation using `np.nanmean`.

This way, the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function should accurately handle the nullable integer data type and correctly perform the aggregation operations for functions like `mean`.
