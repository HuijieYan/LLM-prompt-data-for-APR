The bug appears to be in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` file. The function is intended to aggregate numeric data, but it doesn't handle nullable integers (`Int64` type) correctly, resulting in a `TypeError` when trying to safely cast float64 to int64.

The root cause of the bug is the failure to handle nullable integers during the aggregation process, specifically in the `split_frames` part of the function.

To fix the bug:
1. Check for the presence of nullable integers and handle them appropriately during the aggregation process.
2. Consider using conditional statements to apply the correct casting based on the data type encountered during the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # ... existing code ...

            if result is not no_result:
                # ... existing code ...

                if not np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.integer):
                    # If result is not an integer, safely cast it to the appropriate integer type
                    result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # ... existing code ...

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This version ensures that when a result is not no_result, it is checked for being an integer type and is then safely cast to the appropriate integer type using the `maybe_convert_objects` method.

By addressing the handling of nullable integers specifically, we can fix the TypeError encountered during the aggregation process with nullable integer types.

It's essential to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure that it handles nullable integers appropriately and to maintain compatibility with other data types during the aggregation process.
