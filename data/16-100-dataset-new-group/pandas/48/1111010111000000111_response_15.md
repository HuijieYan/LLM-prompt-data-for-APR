The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has multiple potential error locations. Based on the GitHub issue for this bug, the problem is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. This error occurs when attempting to call aggregate functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer data.

The potential cause of the bug is that the `DataFrameGroupBy` object is not handling the nullable integer data type correctly when calling aggregate functions.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data correctly when calling aggregate functions. This would involve checking for the nullable integer data type and appropriately handling it in the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, 
        how: str, 
        alt=None, 
        numeric_only: bool = True, 
        min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:           
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            values = block.values
            # Handle nullable integer data
            if values.dtype.kind in ['i', 'u']: # i - signed integer, u - unsigned integer
                try:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                        values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            
            if result is not None:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No types to aggregate")
        
        # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This version handles the nullable integer data type by performing a conversion to float before calling the aggregate function, and it appropriately handles the result based on the data type.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases.
