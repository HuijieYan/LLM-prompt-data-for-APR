Based on the runtime input/ouput values and types of the buggy function, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the bug without having the full context, but it's likely that the bug is related to the calculation of the result and the subsequent structure of `agg_blocks` and `new_items`.

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be aggregate data based on certain criteria (`how`), and the bug might be in the logic related to the aggregation process. The result is calculated and then modified based on specific conditions, which might affect the subsequent processing in an unintended way.

A strategy for fixing the bug would involve carefully reviewing the logic for calculating the result, the subsequent processing and structuring of `agg_blocks` and `new_items`, and ensuring that the transformations being applied are consistent with the expected behavior.

Given the complexity of this problem, and the incomplete picture we have from the provided runtime input/ouput values, I recommend refactoring the `_cython_agg_blocks` function while using the test cases themselves to guide the changes.

Below is a corrected version of the function based on a generic fix without a thorough understanding of the entire code and its context:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # ... (rest of the code)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
