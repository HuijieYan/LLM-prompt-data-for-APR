## Bug Cause:

The bug seems to be caused by incorrect handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` function. The function is encountering a `TypeError` when trying to calculate the mean with the nullable integer data type.

## Bug Fix Strategy:

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly, particularly when computing the mean. This may involve type casting or modifying the logic to accommodate the behavior of nullable integer data type in Pandas.

## Bug Fix:

```python
    @rewrite(DataFrameGroupBy)
    def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data._get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        if isinstance(data, DataFrame):
            data = data._prep_ndarray(copy=False)

        return GroupBy._cython_agg_blocks(self, how, alt=alt, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count)
```

This bug fix involves introducing a new implementation of `_cython_agg_blocks` method. We're also calling `get_numeric_data` and `_prep_ndarray` methods on the `data` to ensure the correct handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) during the aggregation process in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

By making these changes, the function should be able to handle the nullable integer data type correctly, and the bug should be resolved.

## Note:

In the provided fix, we are assuming that the methods `get_numeric_data` and `_prep_ndarray` would handle the type casting or modifications required to correctly process the nullable integer data type in the aggregation steps. If these methods do not exist or do not handle the nullable integer data type appropriately, a different approach may be required.
