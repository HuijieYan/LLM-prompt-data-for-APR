The error in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class seems to occur when trying to cast float64 values to int64. This causes a `TypeError` as it is not possible to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64.

It is likely that the aggregation is expecting the result to be of integer type, but the input values are of float type, leading to the error. To fix this, we can try converting the output to float before performing the aggregation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Convert to float
    data = data.astype(float)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # rest of the function code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By converting the input data to float, the problem of casting non-equivalent float64 to int64 will be resolved.
