The provided buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be a part of a larger class and file named `DataFrameGroupBy` in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. It is responsible for performing aggregation operations on grouped data when using the `groupby` method in Pandas.

The test cases provided demonstrate that the function currently fails to compute the correct results for the given values and aggregation functions. The failing test cases use the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on grouped data, and compare the results with expected values. The buggy function is expected to correctly aggregate the data as per the given operations and thus, pass these test cases.

Upon reviewing the provided function, potential errors can be identified within the loop where the aggregation is being performed on the data blocks. It seems that the loop may not be iterating correctly for the specified aggregation operations, resulting in incorrect or unexpected results.

A strategy to fix the bug involves reviewing the loop and the conditions under which different aggregation operations are performed. Additionally, the operations related to excluding blocks and cleaning up split blocks should also be reviewed, as they might be impacting the overall result.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This version attempts to address the issues with the original function and is expected to pass the failing test cases:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result = self.grouper.sql_aggregate(block.values, how, min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            obj = self.obj[block.items[locs]]
            result = obj.groupby(self.grouper).agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        finally:
            if result is not no_result:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
                agg_block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items)

                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise Exception("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = sorted(np.concatenate(new_items, axis=0))
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that this is a hypothetical correction based on the provided information. It is recommended to thoroughly test the corrected function with a variety of use cases to ensure its correctness and effectiveness.
