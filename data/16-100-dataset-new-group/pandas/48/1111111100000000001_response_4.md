## Buggy Function Analysis
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function aims to perform aggregation on blocks based on certain criteria. It uses the `self._get_data_to_aggregate()` method to fetch the data to be aggregated and performs various operations on the blocks. However, there seems to be a bug in the error handling logic, which may cause unexpected behavior during aggregation.

## Potential Error Locations
1. Error handling within the loop (`except NotImplementedError` and `except TypeError`) might not be correctly capturing all exceptional cases.
2. Handling of split frames in the `split_items` branch might not be fully addressing all split block scenarios.
3. Adjusting locs in the blocks and handling deleted items might introduce indexing issues.

## Bug Cause
The bug could arise due to incorrect handling of exceptions, leading to inconsistent results during aggregation. Additionally, the processing of split frames and adjustments in the final indexing might lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Fix Strategy
1. Improve error handling to address all possible exceptional cases during aggregation.
2. Enhance the handling of split frames to ensure all scenarios are correctly accounted for.
3. Review and simplify the process of adjusting locs in the blocks to avoid indexing issues.

## Corrected Version
```python
# Corrected version with improved error handling and split frame processing

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=self.mgr.dtype)
        
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_locs)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks and not split_frames:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_frames:
        new_blocks = []
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]  # Validate shapes
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                new_blocks.append(result._iat[:, i])

        agg_blocks.extend(new_blocks)

    index_order = np.concatenate(new_items)
    aggregated_items = data.items.take(np.sort(index_order))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = np.arange(len(data)) - mask.cumsum()
        indexer = indexer.take(index_order)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = index_order[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, aggregated_items
```

In the corrected version, the error handling logic is improved, and the processing of split frames is appropriately handled. Additionally, the adjustment of locs in the blocks and handling of deleted items is reviewed for simplification and accuracy.
