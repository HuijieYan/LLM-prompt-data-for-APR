The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is causing a TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `std` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype. Based on the provided GitHub issue, this bug seems to be related to the use of the nullable integer data type and its interaction with the grouping and aggregation operations.

The bug is likely caused by the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, when applying aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, or `std`, the function is encountering a TypeError due to how it manages and processes the nullable integer data.

To fix the bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to support the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly without causing TypeErrors during aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    # Iterate over the blocks in the data
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = data._try_aggregate(
            block, self.grouper, how, alt=alt, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    # Get the items and reset the locs in the blocks
    indexer = np.concatenate([block.mgr_locs.as_array for block in agg_blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the `BlockManager` is first converted to use the new nullable integer data type (`Int64`) by calling the `convert_dtypes` method. Then, the function iterates through the blocks in the data, applying the aggregation operation using the `_try_aggregate` method. Finally, it assembles the aggregated blocks and items and returns them as the result.

This corrected version addresses the issue related to TypeErrors when using aggregation operations with the nullable integer data type in a `DataFrameGroupBy`.

By making these changes, the function should now properly handle the nullable integer data type during aggregation operations, resolving the TypeError encountered in the GitHub issue.
