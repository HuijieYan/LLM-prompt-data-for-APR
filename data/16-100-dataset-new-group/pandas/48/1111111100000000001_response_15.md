The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be responsible for aggregating data in DataFrameGroupBy class. The potential error locations could be in the aggregation logic and the management of temporary arrays and lists.

The cause of the bug could be due to incorrect handling of data types, split object-dtype blocks, and potential index-related issues.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling split items and deleted items should be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the DataFrameGroupBy class should handle numeric and object-dtype blocks more reliably.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Adjust the block locs to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate([blk.mgr_locs for blk in data.blocks])
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In this version, the code is streamlined to better handle the aggregation logic and ensure the correct management of locs and items.
