The bug in the code seems to be related to the aggregation of data for numeric columns only. The variable `result` is created using the `self.grouper.aggregate` function, and then attempted to be cast to the original data type. This process breaks when the data is split into multiple blocks, causing the program to throw errors.

To fix the bug, the aggregation for split data needs to be handled separately. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (previous lines of code are unchanged)

    split_agg_blocks = []
    if split_frames:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])
    
    agg_blocks += split_agg_blocks  # Collect split blocks

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Do not forget to sort the indexer
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    indexer = np.sort(indexer)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    if deleted_items:
        # We need to adjust the indexer to account for the items we have removed
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:  # Use final `agg_blocks` list
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we handle the split data separately and collect the split blocks into `split_agg_blocks`. Then, we concatenate this with the original `agg_blocks`. Finally, we sort the indexer, adjust it for removed items, and update the block locations accordingly.

This should fix the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
