The potential error in the _cython_agg_blocks function is the management of the indexer and locs for the blocks in the final output. The logic for handling split blocks and deleted items also seems complex, which could potentially lead to errors.

One strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic for handling split blocks and deleted items, and ensure that the indexing for the final output is handled correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is not None:
                # call our grouper again with only this block
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame reductions
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    # Skip the block if there's an exception in trying to aggregate
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(np.ndarray, result)

            if result is not no_result:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Combine the results into a new BlockManager
    combined_blocks = BlockManager(agg_blocks, [data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))])

    return combined_blocks.blocks, combined_blocks.items
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling split blocks and deleted items has been removed to simplify the function's implementation. The function now aggregates the blocks and combines the results into a new BlockManager before returning the final blocks and items.
