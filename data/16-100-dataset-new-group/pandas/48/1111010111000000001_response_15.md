The given function `_cython_agg_blocks` has few potential error locations and the main cause of the bug is that the function is failing to cast nullable integer values to the correct float value, resulting in incorrect aggregation.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the nullable integer values separately and cast them to the correct float value before performing aggregation. 

Here's the corrected version of the function to address the bug:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            # Handle nullable integer values
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            # Handle non-integer values
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function code remains the same
```

Additionally, avoid using the `assert` statements for handling exceptions and replace them with proper exception handling logic to improve stability.

This corrected version should address the bug and pass the failing test.
