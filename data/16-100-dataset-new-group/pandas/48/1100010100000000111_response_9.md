## Analysis
The issue reported is that calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The error occurs when using the new nullable integer data type.

## Potential Error Locations
1. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles the aggregation logic for the DataFrameGroupBy.
2. The block values may not be properly handled within the function, resulting in a TypeError when applying the `mean` function.

## Cause of the Bug
The bug is likely caused by the function not properly handling the new nullable integer data type (Int64) when performing aggregation operations like `mean`. This results in a TypeError and the incorrect output observed in the GitHub issue.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function properly handles the new nullable integer data type when performing aggregation, specifically for functions like `mean`. This may involve appropriate type checking and data conversion to support nullable integer types during aggregation.

## Corrected Version
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.base import DataError

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError as e:
            if alt is None:
                raise e
            else:
                # Handle aggregation with alternative method
                result = alt(block, axis=self.axis)

        # Adjust the dtype if needed
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_dates=False,
                                       convert_numeric=not is_extension_array_dtype(result))

        # Create the aggregated block
        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

Please note that this is a simplified version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, and it assumes that the necessary type checking and data handling for nullable integer types are being handled appropriately elsewhere in the codebase. Additional modifications might be necessary based on the specific handling of nullable integer types within the Pandas library.
