The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is mainly responsible for aggregating the data in the `GroupBy` object. However, there are several locations within the function that could potentially cause the bug, such as the handling of split object-dtype blocks, the logic for casting the block back to the original dtype, the cleaning up of the mess left over from split blocks, and the adjustment of the indexer to account for the items removed.

Using the failing test case, the bug arises when the `_cython_agg_blocks` function does not handle certain scenarios correctly, leading to DataError. This could be due to the way it processes the numeric data blocks and the split frames.

To fix the bug, a strategy could be to review the handling of different block types, such as object-dtype blocks and split frames, to ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Assume the remaining code in the function remains unchanged
    # ... (other code)

    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Code to handle split object-dtype blocks
        if block.is_object or block.is_extension:
            split_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            split_frames.append(DataFrame(block))
        else:
            # Code to handle numeric data blocks
            # ...

    # Remove the mess left over from split blocks
    if split_items:
        for locs, frame in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            indices = np.argsort(np.concatenate(locs))
            i = 0
            for ind, group in frame.groupby(np.concatenate(locs)):
                size = len(group)
                loc_size = len(locs[i])
                agg_blocks.append(make_block(group, placement=ind, ndim=2))
                offset = 0
                for j, block in enumerate(agg_blocks[-1:]):
                    block.mgr_locs = ind[offset : offset + size]
                    offset += size
                i += 1

    # ...
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the function adds logic to handle split object-dtype blocks correctly. It also properly removes the mess left over from split blocks by creating new blocks and adjusting the locator indices as needed. These changes should resolve the issue causing the failing test cases.
