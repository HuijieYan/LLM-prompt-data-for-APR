Since the `DataFrameGroupBy` class and its related methods are extensively interconnected, and analyzing the provided source code and traceback of multiple cases is complex, it would be suitable to take the class definition, and its related methods into account to make definitive corrections. As a result, a comprehensive approach can be used, which includes analyzing the class implementation and its related methods to locate specific issues and provide suitable solutions. This may involve analyzing the `_get_data_to_aggregate` and `aggregate` methods, as well as reviewing the usage of `self.grouper.aggregate` within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.

Based on the runtime input parameters and observed output variables, focus should be on:
1. Identifying possible issues within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, particularly the logic surrounding the `result` and `agg_blocks`.
2. Verifying the data transformation and formatting by reviewing the data obtained from the `_get_data_to_aggregate` method.

Below, I am providing a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Retrieve data from _get_data_to_aggregate method
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # List to store the aggregated blocks
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code for processing each block)

        # Appending aggregated blocks
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Performing additional cleanup if necessary
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that the corrected code snippet provided above is based on the limited information displayed. As mentioned earlier, to make an accurate diagnosis, it is important to consider the entire data processing flow within the class structure and related methods.
