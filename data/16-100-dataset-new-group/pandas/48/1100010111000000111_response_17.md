The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely causing the `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype. The issue seems related to the manipulation of numeric data.

The `DataFrameGroupBy` is failing when trying to execute `mean` after grouping due to the data type `Int64`. This occurs with `median` and `std` as well.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the nullable integer data type and calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation correctly in the presence of these data types.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function should now handle the nullable integer data type correctly, calculate the `mean`, `median`, and `std` as expected, and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
