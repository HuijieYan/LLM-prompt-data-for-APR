In the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the bug is likely to be caused by the handling of the `min_count` parameter and the `if numeric_only` condition. 

The function is failing to handle nullable integer data type (dtype='Int64') correctly when using the new nullable integer data type, leading to the TypeError when calling mean after grouping. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError". The bug seems to be related to aggregating nullable integer columns when applying a function like mean, median, or var after grouping.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle nullable integer data type correctly, especially when the `numeric_only` flag is set to True.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate().copy()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.fillna(0)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

            if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                # We've split an object block, need to clean up this mess later on
                raise NotImplementedError("Split object block not supported yet.")

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
This corrected function is designed to handle nullable integer type correctly and addresses the issue reported on GitHub related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in TypeError.
