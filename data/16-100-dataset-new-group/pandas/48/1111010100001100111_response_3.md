The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely causing this error. The function is designed to aggregate blocks of data based on certain criteria, but it may not be handling the nullable integer data type properly, leading to the TypeError.

Based on the provided runtime values and types of variables, it seems that the function is working properly in the given test cases, as it is aggregating the data correctly and returning the expected results. Therefore, the GitHub issue might be outdated or not fully representative of the current behavior.

To address the potential issue with calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, the following changes can be attempted in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure it handles the nullable integer data type properly:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Check the dtype of the block and handle nullable integer type
        if block.dtype == "Int64":
            # Convert the block to a regular integer array to avoid TypeError
            block = block.astype("Int64").astype(int)

        # Perform aggregation based on the adjusted block
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        
        # ... existing code ...
```

In the updated code snippet, we check the dtype of the block and handle the nullable integer type by converting it to a regular integer array before performing the aggregation. This approach ensures that the `mean` function, as well as other aggregation functions, can handle the nullable integer data type properly.

Make sure to test that this change resolves the issue reported in the GitHub ticket before committing it. If the provided information from the GitHub issue is accurate and the provided test cases are insufficient, additional analysis would be needed to identify and resolve the bug based on the specific error encountered.

Note: This solution assumes that the current implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is functioning as expected based on the provided runtime values and types of variables. Subsequent analysis may be required if the existing code does not align with the reported issue and test cases.
