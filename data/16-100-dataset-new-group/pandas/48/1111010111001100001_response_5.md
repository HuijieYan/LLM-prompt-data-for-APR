The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is caused by incorrectly constructing the `agg_blocks` list and updating the `mgr_locs` of the blocks. This results in incorrect values being returned, leading to failing test cases.

The fix for this bug involves updating the logic for constructing the `agg_blocks` list and updating the `mgr_locs` for these blocks. The logic for creating the aggregated blocks should be revised based on the provided input values to ensure that the correct values are aggregated and placed in the resulting blocks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, agg_block = self.aggregate_block_values(block.values, how, alt, self.grouper, min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(i, i+1, 1))
    
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the above corrected version of the function, a new method `aggregate_block_values` is called to handle the aggregation of block values. It makes use of the `block`, `how`, `alt`, `grouper`, and `min_count` parameters to correctly compute the `agg_blocks`.

This updated version should fix the bug and make the failing test cases pass.
