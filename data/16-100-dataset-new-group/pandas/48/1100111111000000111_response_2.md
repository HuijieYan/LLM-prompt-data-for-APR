First, the bug is occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The related functions `aggregate` and `_get_data_to_aggregate` are also present in the same file.

The issue seems to occur when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype. The GitHub issue states that it results in a `TypeError` and also mentions that the error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but it does occur with `median` and `std`.

The most probable cause of the bug is related to the handling of nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation operations such as `mean`, `median`, and `var`. The `DataFrameGroupBy` class method `_cython_agg_blocks` is responsible for handling the aggregation of the data, and the bug is likely related to how it processes `Int64` data type in this context.

One possible strategy for fixing the bug would be to add specific handling for `Int64` data type in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to ensure that the aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` work correctly with nullable integer data.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Convert Int64 data to float for aggregation
    data = maybe_convert_objects(data, convert_dates=False, convert_numeric=True, convert_timedelta=False)

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Aggregate result to get single values for each group
        result = _transform_template(result, how, axis=1, labels=None, min_count=min_count)

        agg_blocks.append(make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs, klass=Block))

        indexer = np.concatenate([x for x in block.mgr_locs])

        new_items.append(indexer)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected code, we first convert the `Int64` data to float for aggregation using the `maybe_convert_objects` function. Then, we perform the aggregation and create the aggregated blocks to return the results.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the aggregation operations work correctly with nullable integer data type (`Int64`).
