To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to handle the case when the input DataFrame contains nullable integer (Int64) values. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that calling `mean` after grouping with nullable integer values results in a TypeError. This issue appears when using `int64` dtype or `Int64` dtype and calling mean, median, or std. 

The cause of the bug is likely due to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function not handling nullable integer values correctly, leading to a TypeError when certain aggregation methods are called.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to explicitly handle nullable integer values. We can use the `np.nanmean` and `np.nanmedian` functions provided by NumPy to handle calculations with nullable integer values.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (omitting previous code)

        if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            # Handle nullable integer values
            values = block.values.astype(float)

            if how == 'mean':
                result = np.nanmean(values, axis=1)
            elif how == 'median':
                result = np.nanmedian(values, axis=1)
            # Add handling for other aggregation methods if necessary
            else:
                # For other aggregation methods, use the original method
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )

        else:
            # Handle other types of values
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        # ... (rest of the code)

    # ... (rest of the code)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We explicitly check if the dtype of the block is `pd.Int64Dtype` to identify nullable integer values.
2. If the block contains nullable integer values, we convert the values to float and use `np.nanmean` and `np.nanmedian` to calculate the mean and median, respectively.
3. For other aggregation methods, we continue to use the original method.
4. The rest of the code remains the same as it was in the original function.

By making these changes, we ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can handle nullable integer values and perform the aggregation calculations without raising a TypeError.

This corrected version should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test cases provided.
