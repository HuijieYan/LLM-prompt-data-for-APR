The code fails with a `TypeError` "Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'". This error occurs when the `astype` function is called with the `dtype` parameter of 'int64' and the input values are of type 'float64'.

The issue might be caused by the attempt to cast an object of type 'float64' to 'int64' while performing a function that generates a result in 'float64' format, such as calculating mean or variance. To fix this issue, the code needs to detect these scenarios and avoid the incompatible casting.

One possible strategy to fix the bug would be to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to include logic that specifically handles the case where the result of the aggregation function is of type 'float64' and the target data type for storage is 'int64'. In such cases, the handling can be adapted to avoid the direct casting to incompatible data types.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
          # ... (existing code)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype == np.dtype('int64') and result.dtype == np.dtype('float64'):
              # Check if the result should be stored as 'float64'
              agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            else:
              # Otherwise, use the original dtype of the block
              agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result.astype(block.dtype))

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (existing code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making the modification shown in the updated `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the bug should be resolved and the failing test cases should now pass without the `TypeError` related to casting from 'float64' to 'int64'.
