The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to how it aggregates data using the `grouper` object. The issue reported on GitHub indicates that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`, and similar issues occur with other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`.

The strategy for fixing the bug could involve checking the dtype of the data being aggregated and handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) differently to avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.internals import Block
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result

        # Check if the data is of type 'Int64'
        if block.dtype.name == "Int64":
            # Handle nullable integer data differently
            result = self.grouper._cython_aggregate_number_inv(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle the exception if necessary
                pass

        # Handle the result and aggregation for 'Int64'
        if block.dtype.name == "Int64":
            # Handle nullable integer data differently
            result = result.astype(float)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Return the aggregated blocks and items
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

With this corrected function, it should be able to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when aggregating the data, and it should resolve the reported error when calling `mean` or other aggregation functions on `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.
