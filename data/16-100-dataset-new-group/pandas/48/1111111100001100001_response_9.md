The bug in the given function is causing incorrect results to be returned, as seen in the runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function and the variables right before the function's return. Based on the information provided, it's important to ensure that the aggregation of blocks is being done correctly, and that the result is correctly assembled to aggregate the numeric values within the dataframe.

The returned result is in the form of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` where `agg_blocks` contain the aggregated values and `agg_items` specifies the items in the result. However, the results are inconsistent and not matching the expected values.

To fix the bug, the aggregation of blocks needs to be reviewed. The calculation of aggregation and the handling of data for aggregation should be checked to ensure that correct and consistent results are obtained.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    # Aggregating the numeric values within the dataframe
    if how == "mean":
        result = data.mean()
    elif how == "median":
        result = data.median()
    elif how == "var":
        result = data.var()
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid 'how' parameter")

    # Constructing the aggregated blocks
    for block in result.blocks:
        agg_block = block.make_block()

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, result.items
```

In this corrected version, the aggregation process is simplified to use `mean()`, `median()` and `var()` methods to directly aggregate the data. This should ensure the correct aggregation of the data and the consistent results.
