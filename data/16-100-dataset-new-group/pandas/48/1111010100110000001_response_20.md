The issue is caused by the attempt to cast `float64` to `int64`, which is not allowed. To fix this bug, we need to update the safe casting function to handle the non-equivalent data types. We also need to return the transformed results from the exception of `safe_cast` safely.
Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # Removed other parts of the implementation for brevity

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Code inside the unaffected
        if result is not no_result:
            # Unchanged block
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    # No changes in this section

    result_blocks = []
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc
        result_blocks.append(blk.make_block(blk.values.astype(np.float64)))

    return result_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected implementation, it safely casts the agg_blocks to `np.float64` which should resolve the issue.
Now the function should handle non-equivalent data types and return the results as expected.
