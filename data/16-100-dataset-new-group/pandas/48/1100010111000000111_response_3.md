The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` from the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function is intended to aggregate the data, but it fails when trying to calculate the mean of nullable integer data.

The potential error location is within the try-except block that handles the exception `NotImplementedError`. The code within this block is intended to handle non-applicable functions by calling an alternate function, but it may not be working correctly for the case of calculating mean, median, or var.

The cause of the bug is related to the handling of nullable integer data while aggregating using mean, median, or var methods. The original function does not correctly handle the nullable integer data, leading to a TypeError when trying to calculate these aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to properly handle nullable integer data when using mean, median, or var aggregation. This may involve adjusting the logic within the try-except block and ensuring that the function correctly handles nullable integer data in these cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if isinstance(result, (DataFrame, Series)):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values  # unwrap DataFrame/Series to get array
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, keep_dataframe=True)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[:loc]
        indexer = indexer[loc:]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Make sure to run the test cases to verify that the corrected function passes the failing test.
