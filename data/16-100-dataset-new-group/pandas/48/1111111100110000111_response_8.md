The bug in the provided function causes a TypeError when trying to safely cast an array of float64 to int64 according to the 'safe' rule. The bug is present in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

The cause of the bug is that the function is attempting to perform a cast from `float64` to `int64` using the 'safe' rule, which is not possible due to the non-equivalence of the data types.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the safe casting operation is handled appropriately and the types are compatible.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            # ... other code ...
            
            if result is not no_result:
                if block.dtype != np.int64:
                    result = result.astype(block.dtype, casting='unsafe')
                # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        if split_items:
            # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
            for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
                # ... other code ...
    
        # ... other code ...
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the key change is in handling the dtype casting. If the `result` type is not equivalent to the block's dtype, it is cast explicitly while ensuring that the casting rule is 'unsafe', as casting from float64 to int64 is not allowed according to the 'safe' rule. Then, the result is downcasted using the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function, as before. The `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are then returned after processing the split items and messy blocks.

This correction should resolve the TypeError when performing the safe cast from float64 to int64 and ensure compatibility with different data types.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
