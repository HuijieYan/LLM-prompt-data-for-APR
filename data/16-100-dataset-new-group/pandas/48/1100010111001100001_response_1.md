The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` appears to be failing the tests due to an issue with the calculation and aggregation of the desired result.

Upon examining the provided runtime input/output variable values, it's evident that the function is supposed to aggregate specific values for columns defined in the input DataFrame. However, issues arise with the manipulation and aggregation of the `block` and the subsequent construction of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`.

Based on the provided information, it seems that there are inconsistencies and possible errors involving the computations and manipulations. To address the bug, we can update the logic concerning how data is aggregated and processed within `_cython_agg_blocks`.

Given the above context, we can now provide a corrected version of the buggy function.

## Corrected Version of the Buggy Function

```python
from pandas import DataFrame, Index
from pandas.core.internals import ExtensionBlock
from pandas.core.arrays.integer import IntegerArray
import numpy as np

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: DataFrame = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        block_data = block.values

        # check if block contains integer values
        if isinstance(block_data, IntegerArray):
            result = block_data.mean() if how == "mean" else block_data.median()
            agg_block = ExtensionBlock(result, slice(0, 1, 1), 1, dtype=float)

            # append the newly aggregated block
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

    if len(agg_blocks) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = Index(data.items, dtype='object')
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected version of the function addresses the aggregation process and looks for numeric blocks before performing the aggregation. Additionally, the function returns aggregated blocks and items using the provided DataFrame and input parameters.

Applying these modifications attempts to rectify the issues identified and provides a more effective implementation for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
