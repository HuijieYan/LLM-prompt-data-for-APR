## Analysis
The GitHub issue reports a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue specifies that the error occurs when calling `mean` after grouping, and it also occurs with other functions like `median` and `std`, but not with functions like `min`, `max`, or `first`.

The provided code contains the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is responsible for aggregating the grouped data. It seems likely that the issue is related to the aggregation process performed by this function, resulting in a Type Error when dealing with Int64 dtype.

## Potential Error Locations
- Processing the data blocks in the aggregation loop
- Handling the result of the aggregation
- Dealing with nullable integer data type

## Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type, Int64, during the aggregation process in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The function is not properly handling the nullable integer data type, leading to a Type Error when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function properly handles the aggregation of data with nullable integer type (Int64). This may involve checking for the nullable nature of the data and handling it appropriately during the aggregation process. Additionally, we may need to verify the result of the aggregation before processing it further.

## The Corrected Version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
        block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
    )
    
    if is_dtype_equal(result.dtype, 'Int64'):
        result = result.astype(float)
    
    # existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, after the aggregation result is obtained, we explicitly check if the result has the nullable integer type (Int64). If so, we convert it to a float type using `astype(float)`. This will help in handling the nullable nature of the data and prevent Type Errors when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.
