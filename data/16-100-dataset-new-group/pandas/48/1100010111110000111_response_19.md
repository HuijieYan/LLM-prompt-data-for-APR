The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to arise from the casting of float64 values to int64 using the `astype` method. This issue leads to a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` when calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 is handled appropriately when applying different aggregation functions on the groupby object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if alt is not None:
            result = cast(DataFrame, alt(block.values, axis=self.axis))
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, copy=False)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

By using `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_numeric`, we ensure that the casting is performed correctly for different aggregation functions, avoiding the TypeError that was previously encountered.

This fix should address the TypeError when calling aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype. This will address the issue reported on GitHub as well.
