The bug may be occurring because the `deleted_items` is empty, so the loop over `data.blocks` isn't excluding any blocks. This could be due to the condition for handling of `NotImplementedError` and `how` not being met.

The `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to grouping and aggregating data, and the issue might be that the function expects a specific behavior for `NotImplementedError` that isn't being handled as expected. The error messages when `NotImplementedError` is raised is causing the issue.

A potential fix for the bug could be to revise the handling of `NotImplementedError` and `how` for the relevant block which is causing the issue. Additionally, checking if the length of `deleted_items` is zero and properly managing the behavior when `NotImplementedError` occurs.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function based on the analysis:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... previous code ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... existing code ...
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Logic for how == "ohlc" case
                if how == "ohlc":
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
            else:
                # Logic for alternate aggregation function
                # ... existing code ...
        # ... existing code ...

    # ... existing code ...
```

This corrected version handles the `NotImplementedError` for both the existing `how` condition and an alternate condition, and deals with the deletion or continuation of the block items accordingly.

It's important to thoroughly test this corrected function with various test cases to ensure that it functions as expected.
