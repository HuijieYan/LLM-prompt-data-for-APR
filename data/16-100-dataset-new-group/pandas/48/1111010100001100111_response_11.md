## Issue Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem with calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object, resulting in a `TypeError` specifically when the input data type is `Int64`. The expected behavior is to calculate the mean without any errors, as shown in the example output provided. The versions of pandas and other related libraries being used are also mentioned.

## Potential Error Locations
The error could be occurring within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is used to perform aggregation operations on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. Due to the specific mention of the `mean` function and the `Int64` data type, it's likely that the bug exists in the calculation of the mean when the data is of this type. 

Additionally, based on the report, it seems that other aggregation functions such as `min`, `max`, `first`, `median`, and `std` could also be affected.

## Cause of the Bug
Based on the provided runtime values, the bug seems to be caused by the handling of nullable integer data (`Int64`) during the aggregation process. The type casting and handling of such data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely leading to the `TypeError` when calculating the mean or certain other aggregation functions.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, the handling of `Int64` data during aggregation should be reviewed and updated to ensure compatibility with all supported aggregation functions. This might involve additional checks and handling for nullable integer data to avoid the reported `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix
Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that includes additional checks for handling `Int64` data when performing aggregation with different functions:

```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Additional check for Int64 data
    if data._is_int64 and how in {'mean', 'median', 'std'}:
        # Cast the Int64 data to a compatible type for aggregation
        data = maybe_convert_objects(data, convert_integer=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the additional check for `Int64` data has been added, and appropriate type conversion is performed to ensure compatibility with aggregation operations involving `mean`, `median`, and `std`. This should address the reported `TypeError` issue and ensure consistent behavior across different aggregation functions.
