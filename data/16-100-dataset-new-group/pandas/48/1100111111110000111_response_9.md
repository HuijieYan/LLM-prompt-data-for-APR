The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing a TypeError when attempting to cast a float64 array to int64. This bug is causing the failing tests to return an error. 

The specific issue is occurring when the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions are applied to a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The issue has been reported on the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

To resolve the bug, we need to handle the `Int64` dtype in a way that prevents the TypeError when aggregating the groups. It's likely that the bug is related to improper handling of the `Int64` dtype, causing the TypeError when casting from float64 to int64.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # This handles the Int64 dtype properly
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False, downcast="infer")

    # Rest of the original code
    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []
    # Rest of the code
```

This version of the function includes a specific handling for the `Int64` dtype when getting the numeric data. By using the `downcast="infer"` parameter, we allow Pandas to downcast the integer column to the smallest numeric dtype that can represent all the values, preventing the TypeError when casting from float64 to int64.

This should resolve the bug and allow the failing tests to pass as expected.
