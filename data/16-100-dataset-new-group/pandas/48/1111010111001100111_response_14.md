To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the following approach can be adopted:

- The issue raised on GitHub indicates that calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError.
- Inspecting the failing test cases and the runtime variables, it's evident that the issue arises from aggregation operations on the `DataFrameGroupBy` object when using the `Int64` dtype.
- The source of the problem appears to be in the `grouper.aggregate` call within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, which is unable to handle the `Int64` dtype correctly.
- Updating the `grouper.aggregate` logic to handle the `Int64` dtype, and possibly other nullable integer dtypes, should resolve the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing logic ...
    # add logic here to handle Int64 dtype correctly
    if self.obj.select_dtypes(include=['Int64']).shape[1] > 0:
        how_function = getattr(self.grouper, how)
        old_data = self.obj
        new_data = self.obj.astype('float64')  # Convert Int64 dtype to float64 for aggregation
        try:
            result = how_function(new_data, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except TypeError:
            # If TypeError is still raised, fall back to the original data and operate using slow aggregation
            result = how_function(old_data, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
    else:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(data.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

    # ... existing logic ...
```

In this corrected function, we added a section to detect if the DataFrame contains columns with the `Int64` dtype. If so, we convert those columns to `float64` before performing the aggregation operation. If a TypeError is still raised, we then fall back to the original data and operate using a slower aggregation. This approach allows us to handle the issue with calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype. However, it's important to test this solution to ensure it works as expected.
