The method `safe_cast` is used to safeguard the casting from floats to integers, which is necessary since integers are seen as non-equivalent to floats by NumPy according to the rule 'safe'. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when we cast `values` to `int64` when generating `integer_array`, the method `safe_cast` is invoked to achieve the preprocessing.

The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
                
    # Updating the part below

            # call the safe_cast method to process the safe casting from float to int64
            values, mask = coerce_to_array(block.values, dtype=np.int64, copy=False)
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            result = safe_cast(result, block.dtype, copy=False)

            # Merge to safe_cast
            if alt is not None:
                data = safe_cast(data, np.float64, copy=False)
                alt = safe_cast(alt, np.float64, copy=False)
                block = safe_cast(block, np.float64, copy=False)

        agg_blocks.append(result)
        new_items.append(locs)

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

The method `safe_cast` is overridden to prevent NaNs from being cast as integers placing this modified version of `_cython_agg_blocks` in line with the original implementation from the Pandas source code.
