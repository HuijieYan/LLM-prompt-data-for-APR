Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function, it seems that the bug is related to the way the function is handling the nullable integer data type (Int64 dtype) when performing aggregation operations.

The bug seems to be occurring when calling the mean, median, or std functions after grouping a DataFrame with nullable integer values of Int64 dtype. The issue is the result of a TypeError being raised, indicating a problem with the type compatibility or handling of the nullable integer values during aggregation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles nullable integers and the Int64 dtype when performing aggregation.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        values = block.values.astype(float)  # Convert to float to handle nullable integers
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if how in ["mean", "median", "std", "var"]:  # Handle mean, median, std, and var
            result = np.nanmean(values, axis=1)  # Handle nullable values using np.nanmean
            result = result.reshape((1, -1))

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we ensure that the function properly handles nullable integer values by converting them to float using `astype(float)`. We also handle aggregation functions such as mean, median, std, and var explicitly using numpy functions that handle nullable values, such as `np.nanmean`. This should resolve the TypeError issue when performing aggregation operations.

By applying this fix, the function should be able to handle nullable integer values of Int64 dtype properly and provide the expected output without raising a TypeError.
