Looking at the code of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it becomes apparent that the bug might be related to the `get_numeric_data` method in Pandas. The function is used to obtain only the numeric values from the BlockManager, but this might be causing issues with the nullable integer type.

The failing test case demonstrates an issue when calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. 

The cause of the bug may be that the `get_numeric_data` method is not handling the nullable integer type correctly, leading to the TypeError when calculating the mean or other statistical functions.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the nullable integer type explicitly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This could involve checking for this type and applying separate logic to handle it properly when performing numeric operations.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # Handle nullable integer type explicitly
        if isinstance(data._block.values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray):
            data = data.copy()
            data._blocks = data._rebuild_blknos_and_blklocs()
            data._astype('Int64')

        else:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This fix involves explicitly handling the nullable integer type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. By detecting the IntegerArray type and converting it to 'Int64' where necessary, we address the issue when performing numeric operations on nullable integers.
