The bug in the `pandas` library seems to be related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`. This occurs when using the new nullable integer data type. The behavior is inconsistent, as calling min, max, or first doesn't result in an error, but calling median and std does.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with safely casting non-equivalent types (e.g., trying to cast `float64` to `int64`), which suggests that the bug lies in the handling of data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

To fix this bug, there might be a need to handle the casting of non-equivalent types more explicitly. The error message indicates the presence of an internal function `safe_cast` which tries to cast the values to the given dtype but fails due to non-equivalence.

To address this, you will need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` module. The function needs to be updated to handle the casting of non-equivalent types explicitly and gracefully. This may involve using the `maybe_convert_objects` function from the `pandas.core.dtypes.cast` module to handle the casting in a safer manner.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to fix the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Fixing the issue with casting non-equivalent types
    casted_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        casted_block = maybe_convert_objects(block, dtype='Int64')
        casted_blocks.append(casted_block)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # rest of the function...
```

By using `maybe_convert_objects` on each block within the `data`, we can handle the casting in a safer and more efficient manner, which should resolve the issue with calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype.

After making this change, the updated `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be able to handle the casting of non-equivalent types more gracefully, fixing the error encountered when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype.

The proposed fix should resolve the issue outlined in the GitHub bug report and ensure that calling mean with `Int64` dtype works as expected.
