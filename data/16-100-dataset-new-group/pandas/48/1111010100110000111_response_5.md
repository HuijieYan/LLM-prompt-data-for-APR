Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue, it seems that the bug is related to safe casting non-equivalent float64 to int64. The bug occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The cause of the bug is that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is not handling the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64 properly. It seems to be trying to cast values from float64 to int64, which generates the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64. We can use the `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` function from pandas to perform the safe casting.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        
        # ... (other parts of the function)

        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            # (existing code)

            # try to perform the operation using the safe casting
            try:
                # handle safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64
                result, _ = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(block, how, alt=alt, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only)
            except TypeError:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )

            # rest of the code remains the same
```

In the corrected version, we have replaced the try-except block with a call to `maybe_downcast_to_dtype`. This function handles the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64, preventing the TypeError from occurring.

By making these changes, we can ensure that the safe casting of non-equivalent float64 to int64 is handled properly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
