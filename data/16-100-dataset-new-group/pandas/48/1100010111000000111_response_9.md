The issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function lies in its handling of nullable integers. The bug causes a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype. This issue was reported in the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle nullable integer values correctly, leading to a TypeError when performing aggregation operations like `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer dtype.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer types appropriately and avoid any type-related issues. We need to make sure that the function can handle both regular integers and nullable integers when performing aggregation operations.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # updated implementation

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.integer) or pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            result = block

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    result = self.obj[0:0]

    for new_item, agg_block in zip(new_items, agg_blocks):
        result = result.setitem(new_items, agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, result
```

This corrected version ensures that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function can handle both regular integers and nullable integers, preventing the TypeError when calling aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with nullable integer dtype.
