The current function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be failing for the provided test because it is unable to handle nullable integers dtype ('Int64') correctly. This is evident from the failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` where the buggy function is being tested against mean, median, and var functions with nullable integer values. The expected output is a DataFrame filled with float values, but the buggy function is not producing the expected output. 

One potential cause of the bug could be the data type conversion issue related to nullable integers. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to process data types within a loop, and there might be a situation where the nullable integers are not being handled properly, leading to the unexpected output.

To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be modified to handle nullable integer data type ('Int64') correctly when applying aggregation functions like mean, median, and var. This would involve checking for nullable integers and ensuring appropriate data type handling throughout the function.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code ...

    # Handle nullable integers
    if hasattr(data, "conversion"):
        # Ensure proper conversion of nullable integer datatype
        data = data.conversion.ensure_type('float64')

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

Updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integers appropriately should resolve the issue and make the function produce the expected output for the failing test.

Please include this corrected version of the function in the relevant file in the pandas codebase and run the failing test again to verify that the bug has been fixed.
