The issue appears to be related to the `safe_cast` function within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module. The `safe_cast` function attempts to cast an array from float64 dtype to int64 dtype using the "safe" casting rule, which is resulting in a TypeError.

The cause of the bug is that the `safe_cast` function does not handle conversion from float64 to int64 as expected. When trying to cast a float64 array to int64 using "safe" casting, it encounters a TypeError and raises an error.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to modify the `safe_cast` function to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 by performing a type check and casting appropriately based on the dtype of the values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method with a modified `safe_cast` function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code)

    def safe_cast(values, dtype, copy: bool):
        """
        Safely cast the values to the dtype if they
        are equivalent, meaning floats must be equivalent to the
        ints.
        """
        if isinstance(dtype, np.int64) and values.dtype == np.float64:
            return values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)
        else:
            return values.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # ... (other code)
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This modified version of the function includes an updated `safe_cast` function that performs a type check to handle the conversion from float64 to int64 appropriately. This should address the TypeError issue when attempting to perform safe casting.

The correction should resolve the issue of calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError, as reported in the GitHub issue.
