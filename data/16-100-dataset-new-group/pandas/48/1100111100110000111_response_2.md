The error is occurring because the function `safe_cast` is unable to cast from a dtype of 'float64' to 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. This is triggered by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

The cause of the bug is that the `_from_sequence` method is returning an array of float64 values, and it is attempting to cast them to int64, which leads to the TypeError. This is due to a problem in the way the method is handling the data when calculating the aggregate functions.

To fix the bug, I suggest modifying the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure the correct datatype is preserved during aggregation. Specifically, when creating the `agg_block`, make sure it preserves the original data type instead of casting it to a different type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)

        # Safely cast the data back to its original dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(block.values, dtype=block.dtype)

        # Create the aggregated block
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

In this version, we make use of the `maybe_convert_objects` function to safely cast the data back to its original dtype before creating the aggregated block.

This correction should fix the bug by ensuring that the aggregated data maintains its original dtype, resolving the TypeError when casting from float64 to int64.

This should address the issue reported on GitHub as well.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions or issues!
