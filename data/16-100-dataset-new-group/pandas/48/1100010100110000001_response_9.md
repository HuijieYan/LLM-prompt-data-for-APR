The bug seems to occur in the _cython_agg_blocks function, specifically when trying to convert a float64 into an int64 using the values.astype() method. This is happening at block.make_block(result) when a non-null DataFrame result is being constructed which contains float64 values.

The bug is likely due to the code incorrectly expecting the result to always be able to be cast to the original dtype, in this case an int64. However, since the result might contain float64 values, the original dtype (int64) and the dtype of result (float64) are not equivalent, hence the error message. The function 'maybe_downcast_numeric' should also be adjusted to handle the possibility of a non-equivalent conversion in the error handling block.

To fix the bug, the exception block in the function block.make_block(result) should be updated to handle the non-equivalent dtype conversion (float64 to int64) gracefully. We can adjust the return values at this point so that types are appropriately handled.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code...
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # Safely attempt to downcast the result to the original dtype of the block
            try:
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            except Exception:
                pass

            # Safely construct the aggregation block
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        # existing code...

    # existing code...
  
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this fix, most of the non-equivalent dtype conversion issues should be handled gracefully, avoiding potential TypeErrors.
