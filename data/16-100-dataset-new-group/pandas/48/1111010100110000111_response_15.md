## Analysis
The error is likely related to the casting of data types during the aggregation process when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` methods on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The error message indicates that it is not possible to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, which suggests the issue might be related to the type casting of the data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. This leads to a TypeError when calling these aggregation methods.

Upon inspecting the provided code and error message, it seems that the error occurs while performing type conversion when aggregating the data in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.

The issue on GitHub also suggests that the error does not occur with certain other aggregation methods like `min`, `max`, or `first`, which indicates that the issue is specifically related to the `mean`, `median`, and `var` methods.

Given the details mentioned, the strategy for fixing the bug could involve modifying the type casting logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to correctly handle the nullable integer data type when performing these aggregation operations.

Additionally, since the input data has the `Int64` data type, the corrected version should also ensure that the nullable integer data type is handled appropriately when performing the aggregrations.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing logic...
        if how in {"mean", "median", "var"} and isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values.astype(float), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        # existing logic...
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # handle nullable integer type
            if how in {"mean", "median", "var"} and isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, pd.Int64Dtype())

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # existing logic...
```

In this corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we handle the `Int64` data type specifically for the `mean`, `median`, and `var` aggregation methods. We convert the values of the block to `float` type if it's an `Int64` type when performing these aggregation operations. After aggregation, we handle the nullable integer type using `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` to ensure that the result is correctly cast back to the original `Int64` data type if needed. This should resolve the TypeError issue related to nullable integer type casting during aggregation.
