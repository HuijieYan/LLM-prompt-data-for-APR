The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing to correctly perform aggregation operations when the input data contains nullable integer types (Int64). This causes a TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object. The issue has been reported on GitHub and the expected output is not being achieved due to this bug.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer types correctly when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self,
    how: str,
    alt=None,
    numeric_only: bool = True,
    min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... existing code

    # Nullable integer types handling
    if data.isna().any().any():
        data = data.astype(float)

    # ... existing code
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the input data contains any NaN values, which is a characteristic of nullable integer types. If NaN values are present, we convert the data to float type to handle nullable integer types correctly during aggregation operations.

This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles nullable integer types correctly, allowing the aggregation operations to produce the expected output.
