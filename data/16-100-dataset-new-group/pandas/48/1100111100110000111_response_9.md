The bug found in the `DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` function within the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The function appears to be trying to cast an array from dtype 'float64' to 'int64' using the `values.astype()` method, which is failing with a TypeError. This issue has been reported on the GitHub page with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the safe_cast function being unable to safely cast the array from 'float64' to 'int64' according to the 'safe' rule. This is occurring when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the safe_cast function can handle the casting of 'float64' to 'int64' according to the 'safe' rule. This can be done by either checking for and handling this specific case within the safe_cast function, or by using a different approach to perform the necessary casting while avoiding the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (other parts of the loop)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can safely cast the block back to the original dtype
            try:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_dates=False, try_float=True)
            except TypeError:
                # fallback to using the original result
                pass

            # performance optimization for not using the try-except for every block
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype, copy=False)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            # ... (other parts of the loop)

    # ... (other parts of the function)
```

With this corrected version of the function, the safe casting of the block back to the original dtype is attempted using the `maybe_convert_objects()` function. If that fails with a TypeError, it falls back to using the original result. Then, the `maybe_downcast_to_dtype()` function is utilized to downcast the result to the original dtype, which can help avoid the TypeError while safely casting the array.

This approach should address the issue reported and allow calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype without resulting in a TypeError.
