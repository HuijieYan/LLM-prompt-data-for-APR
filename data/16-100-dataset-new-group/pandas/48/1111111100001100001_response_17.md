The buggy function is returning incorrect results in all the cases provided. As we can observe, the function is intended to aggregate data based on numeric values present in a DataFrame. It first filters out the numeric data and then performs aggregation using the grouper object. However, it fails to properly store the aggregated blocks and does not handle the split blocks correctly.

It seems that the function has issues related to managing the aggregated blocks as well as handling the split frames. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in conversion of data types during the aggregation process.

To fix the bug, the following changes could be considered:
1. Ensure that the aggregation process for numeric values handles split blocks correctly.
2. Handle the aggregation exceptions by checking for specific cases and applying alternative methods.
3. Validate the dimensionality and data types of the aggregated results before assigning them to the agg_blocks.
4. Update the placement and locs of the aggregated blocks to align with the ordering.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        else:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        if block.is_extension:
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
        else:
            agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(slice(idx, idx+1, 1))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we handle the block aggregation correctly, include alternate aggregation methods, and ensure proper placement and locs for the aggregated blocks. This should address the issues and produce correct results.
