The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which results in a TypeError. The imported function `safe_cast` is failing to handle the casting of float64 to int64 according to the rule 'safe'. The bug is surfaced by the failing test cases that aim to call `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the values are correctly cast to the desired dtype, and the casting operation is handled in a way that correctly handles nullable integer types.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # generally if we have numeric_only=False
                # and non-applicable functions
                # try to python agg
    
                if alt is None:
                    # we cannot perform the operation
                    # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
    
                # call our grouper again with only this block
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                    #  reductions; see GH#28949
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
    
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                    # continue and exclude the block
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
    
            if result is not None:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
                agg_blocks.append(maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype='int64', copy=False))
                new_items.append(locs)
    
        if not (agg_blocks):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
        # current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:
            # we need to adjust the indexer to account for the
            # items we have removed
            # really should be done in internals :<
    
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the major change is the use of `maybe_convert_objects` and `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` to handle the conversion of the data to the correct dtype. These functions will ensure that the casting operation is correctly handled for nullable integer types.

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function will resolve the TypeError when calling mean, median, and var on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.
