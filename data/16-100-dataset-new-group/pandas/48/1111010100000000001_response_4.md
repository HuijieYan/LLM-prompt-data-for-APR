The potential error locations within the buggy function include:
1. The use of undeclared variables such as `as_array`, `how`, `axis`, `min_count`, `alt`, `data.items`, `self.values`, and `self.axis`, which are not defined within the scope of the function.
2. The lack of error handling for certain exceptions such as `NotImplementedError` and `TypeError`.
3. The inappropriate usage of assertions within the function, especially for type checks.
4. The use of conditional blocks that might not cover all possible scenarios for data handling.

The cause of the bug is that the function attempts to perform complex operations on the data blocks without proper checks and error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential crashes.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to:
1. Declare all the variables needed within the scope of the function.
2. Use proper error handling techniques such as try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
3. Remove unnecessary assertions and replace them with traditional if-else checks.
4. Ensure that all possible scenarios for data handling are covered in the conditional blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
  
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.values
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Alternate method not provided")
            obj = self.obj._slice((slice(None), locs))._juggle()
            s = obj.groupby(self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            if not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result._property_map(lambda x: np.atleast_2d(x).T)
                
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
        agg_block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
