## Analysis
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a `TypeError` related to casting values from `float64` dtype to `int64` dtype. This error occurs when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer values (dtype='Int64'). The error message indicates that the `values.astype` operation is failing because it cannot safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` according to the rule "safe". This issue has also been reported and documented in the official pandas GitHub repository as issue #32219.

## Bug Description
The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when trying to cast values from `float64` to `int64`. The function fails to handle nullable integer values (dtype='Int64') correctly, resulting in the casting error when trying to perform aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to handle the casting of nullable integer values correctly. Specifically, the function should identify the data type of the values and perform the casting accordingly to ensure that the aggregation operations for `mean`, `median`, and `var` work as expected with nullable integer values.

## The Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/groupby/generic.py

class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    # ... other functions ...

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

        for block in data.blocks:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

            try:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )[0]
            except NotImplementedError:
                pass
            else:
                # Perform casting based on result dtype
                if result.dtype == 'float64' and block.dtype.kind in 'iu':
                    result = result.astype(block.dtype, casting="safe")

                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # rest of the function ...
```

In this corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, the relevant logic for casting values based on their dtype has been introduced. When the `result` is of type 'float64' and the original `block` type is of type 'int64' or 'uint64', a safe casting is performed to ensure the expected behavior for aggregation operations with nullable integer values. It addresses the issue reported in the GitHub problem statement.

This modification should address the casting issue and allow the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to work correctly with nullable integers when performing aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
