The bug in the provided `cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to an issue in handling the non-numeric values in the dataframe when `numeric_only` is set to `True`. The function is supposed to aggregate the numeric data while avoiding the non-numeric ones, however, it seems to encounter errors when trying to do that.

The fix strategy for this bug would involve properly handling the non-numeric data and excluding them from aggregation when `numeric_only` is set to `True`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
        
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(block.dtype):  
                result = no_result
                locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
                try:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                        block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
                except NotImplementedError:
                    if alt is None:
                        raise NotImplementedError("Cannot perform the operation in an alternate way")
                    else:
                        result = block.apply(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            else:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            if result is not no_result:
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):  
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
        
        # rest of the code as is
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the non-numeric values by excluding them from the aggregation process. We use the `pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype` method to identify the numeric columns and then handle the aggregation accordingly. Non-numeric columns are excluded from the aggregation process.
