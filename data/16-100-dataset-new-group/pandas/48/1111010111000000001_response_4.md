The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks()`, which is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. 

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Handling of split items and frames
2. Assertion for checking the length of result data blocks

The cause of the bug is that the function fails when trying to cast a block back to the original dtype and clean up split blocks because the code doesn't handle split items and frames properly.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to:
1. Properly handle split items and frames.
2. Revise the assertion for checking the length of result data blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items_results: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame reductions; see GH#28949
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

        if result is not None:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if agg_blocks or split_items_results:
        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        if deleted_items:
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data))
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
            offset += loc

    else:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
With this corrected version of the function, it should pass the failing test.
