The issue is occurring when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with the `Int64` dtype. This results in a `TypeError`. The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but does also occur with `median` and `std`.

The error message is as follows:
```text
values = array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5]), dtype = <class 'numpy.int64'>, copy = False
TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'
```

The error is occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`.

The cause of the bug is related to handling nullable integer dtype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The issue arises when trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, which is not possible, resulting in the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, an approach that can be taken is to explicitly handle the nullable integer dtype within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, ensuring that the casting from float64 to int64 is handled properly for nullable integers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # pattern-matching condition
        if block.dtype == "Int64":
            result = block.values.astype(float).mean(axis=1)
        else:
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            result = no_result
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            # ... (remaining exception handling codes)
        
        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype == "Int64":
                # cast the dtype to Int64 if feasible
                result = result.astype(block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)
    
    # remaining part of the function...
```

With this corrected version, the function explicitly handles the nullable integer dtype, casting the values to float for the `mean` operation, and then back to `Int64` to handle the nullable integer dtype appropriately.

This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `mean` function works correctly for nullable integer dtype in a `DataFrameGroupBy` object.
