To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the error may be located in the logic for handling nullable integer values. Since the particular issue is related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in TypeError, the bug may be in the aggregation step or the casting of data types.

The cause of the bug can be traced to how the function `_cython_agg_blocks` handles nullable integer values during aggregation, potentially leading to a TypeError when calling `mean`. This is evident from the failing test where the test case clearly shows that using new nullable integer data type, calling `mean` after grouping results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, you need to ensure that the function correctly handles nullable integer values during aggregation, specifically when calculating the mean.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.is_numeric:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexed_data = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = np.array([i])

    return agg_blocks, indexed_data
```

In this corrected version, only the numeric blocks are selected for aggregation based on the `numeric_only` condition. The results are directly created for the selected numeric blocks and added to the `agg_blocks`. Finally, the correct `indexed_data` containing the aggregated results and the corresponding indices are returned.

This updated `_cython_agg_blocks` function should resolve the issue and pass the failing tests related to the bug.
