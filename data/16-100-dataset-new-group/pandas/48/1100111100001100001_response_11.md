The buggy function appears to be having issues with properly handling the `how` parameter values and types, specifically when trying to aggregate the data with non-numeric types. It seems that for `how='ohlc'`, there is a case where the function is not handling the exception or implementation correctly, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Given the multi-case analysis and related to the run-time input/output values, the cause of the bug is that the function fails to properly handle the given `how` parameter values and types. The `how` parameter indicates which aggregation function to use, and it affects the flow of the function. In some cases where non-numeric types are encountered, it appears that the function tries to execute an alternate aggregation approach, but this logic isn't properly implemented, leading to incorrect results or potential errors.

To correct the bug, the function should be reviewed to ensure that all possible branches of execution based on the `how` parameter are properly handled. This would involve revisiting the logic where the `how` parameter causes changes in the aggregation process, ensuring that exceptions and error cases are effectively addressed.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None and how == "ohlc":
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                        split_items.append(locs)
                        split_frames.append(result)
                        continue

                    assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        # remaining code unchanged
    # remaining code unchanged
```

In the corrected version, the logic for handling non-numeric data and exceptions with the `how` parameter has been revisited, ensuring that all cases are properly handled.

By implementing these changes, the function should now properly handle the various aggregation methods based on the `how` parameter, and any issues related to handling non-numeric data should be resolved.
