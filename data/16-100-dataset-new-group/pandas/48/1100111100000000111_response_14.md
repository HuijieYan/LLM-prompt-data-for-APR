The bug identified in the GitHub issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function after grouping a DataFrame with the new nullable integer data type `Int64`, resulting in a TypeError. This issue occurs when calling `mean` but not when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`. It also occurs with `median` and `std`. The expected output is the mean of the grouped data, but it results in a TypeError.

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be processing the aggregation of numeric data after being grouped. It has a conditional check `if numeric_only` which filters the data to only numeric data using `data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)`. The bug appears to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type `Int64` during this numeric data filtering process.

We can fix the bug by modifying the conditional check for `numeric_only` to handle the nullable integer data type `Int64` properly by checking if the data is of type `Int64` and handling it accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        if isinstance(data.iget(0, 0), pd.Int64Dtype):
            numeric_data = data.select_dtypes(include=['number']).copy()
        else:
            numeric_data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    else:
        numeric_data = data

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for the nullable integer data type `Int64` using the `isinstance` function. If the data is of type `Int64`, we select the columns with numeric data using `select_dtypes` and handle it separately. Otherwise, we continue with the original process of filtering numeric data.

By handling the nullable integer data type `Int64` explicitly, we address the issue of encountering a TypeError when calling the `mean` function after grouping. This fix ensures that the numeric aggregation works correctly with the nullable integer data type `Int64` without raising any TypeErrors.
