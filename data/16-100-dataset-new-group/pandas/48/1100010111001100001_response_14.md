The root cause of the bug introduced in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is the incorrect aggregation logic within the loop. The function is intended to aggregate data based on the specified method and axis, and it appears that the computation is failing for certain combinations of input data and aggregation methods, resulting in incorrect results.

The common patterns observed in the failing tests are:
- The input DataFrame consists of columns 'a' and 'b' with 'b' containing NA values.
- Aggregating the DataFrame using methods like 'mean', 'median', or 'var' results in an output DataFrame with incorrect values.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves making adjustments to the aggregation logic within the loop to correctly handle the aggregation of numeric data, especially in the presence of NA values. This can potentially involve incorporating special handling for NA values or determining the correct aggregation strategy for such cases.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

It is important to validate the corrected function with the failing test cases provided to ensure that it produces the expected correct results.
