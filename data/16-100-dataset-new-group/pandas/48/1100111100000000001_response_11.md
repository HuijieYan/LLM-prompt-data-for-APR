The bug in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely to occur in the logic for processing and aggregating the data blocks, as well as in the exception handling. The issue could result from mishandling of the data blocks or incorrect aggregation of the results, as well as issues with exception handling and object casting.

To fix the bug, it's essential to carefully handle the data blocks, perform the aggregation correctly, and improve the exception handling. Additionally, explicit type checks and handling should be added to ensure correct results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                obj = self.obj[block.items[0]]
                
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                        agg = result._data.blocks
                    else:
                        result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                        if result.ndim == 1:
                            result = result.reshape(-1, 1)
        else:
            if not isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                raise DataError("Unexpected result type")
            
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rest of the code for cleaning up split blocks and adjusting locs

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version:
- I've replaced the `get_numeric_data` method with `convert` to ensure consistent handling of data blocks.
- Used direct indexing and type checks to handle the aggregation results to avoid potential errors.
- Improved exception handling by explicitly raising an error when encountering unexpected result types.
- The rest of the code remains unchanged, assuming it's free of bugs.

Please note that the actual implementation might need further adjustments depending on the specifics of the behavior you want to achieve.
