From the buggy function, it seems that the main issues arise in the loop where the data blocks are being processed. There are multiple error handling scenarios that are not being handled properly. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors during the aggregation process.

The cause of the bug could be related to the handling of exceptions and results during the aggregation process. There are scenarios where blocks are excluded without proper handling, and the control flow to process split blocks is not well-defined.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve revising the exception handling logic, ensuring that missing error conditions are properly managed, and handling split blocks in a more organized manner.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is None:
            continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for result in split_frames:
        for i in range(result.shape[1]):
            new_items.append(np.array([i], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    # Reset locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the exception handling is refined and the processing of split blocks is managed in a more organized way. This should help in resolving the issues with unexpected behavior or errors during the aggregation process.
