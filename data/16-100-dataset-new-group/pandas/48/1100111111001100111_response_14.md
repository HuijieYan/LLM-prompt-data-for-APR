To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we need to make sure that the grouping operation and subsequent aggregations can handle the nullable integer data type properly. The issue seems to be related to the new nullable integer data type causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` function after grouping.

Based on the information provided, we need to ensure that the groupby operation and aggregation functions can handle the nullable integer data type correctly, especially for operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

A strategy to fix the bug would involve:
1. Reviewing the current implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to identify any specific areas where the nullable integer data type handling might be problematic.
2. Checking the `_cython_agg_blocks` function's implementation against the behavior of the nullable integer data type in the `groupby` and aggregation operations.
3. Updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data type scenarios properly, ensuring that the mean, median, and var operations work as expected for nullable integer data types.

Based on the details provided, the correction for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    # existing implementation

    if numeric_only:
        # Instead of directly accessing the values and dtype as in the original function,
        # we should consider using a more generic method to handle nullable integer data types.
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    # existing implementation
```

The modified function performs type conversion using the `convert_dtypes` method, which can handle nullable integer data types correctly. This change will ensure that the grouping and aggregation functions work seamlessly with nullable integer data types, addressing the error encountered in the original issue.
