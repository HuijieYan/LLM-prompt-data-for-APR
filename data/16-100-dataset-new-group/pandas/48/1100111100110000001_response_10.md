Looking at the error messages, we can see that the issue is related to casting from the float64 dtype to int64 dtype. This is occurring within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically when attempting to safely cast the values of a DataFrame to a specified dtype.

From the error message, it appears that the code is using the `safe_cast` function, and this is where the TypeError is being raised.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that any attempt to cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64 (or any other dtype) is handled appropriately.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # ValueError is raised if the operation is not valid, so handle this case
                if alt is None or how != "ohlc":
                    # Exclude the block
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                
                # Call the alt function with the axis and attempt the aggregation
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                try:
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                except AttributeError:
                    continue
            
            if result is not no_result:
                # Handle the dtype casting here appropriately
                try:
                    result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)
                    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype, cast_dtype=block.dtype)
                    result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
                except (DataError, SpecificationError) as e:
                    raise TypeError(f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype(block.dtype)}") from e
                
                agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
                new_items.append(locs)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
        if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
    
        if split_items:
            # Handle the case of split blocks
            for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
                for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                    new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                    agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])
    
        # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
        # current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
        if deleted_items:
            # Adjust the indexer to account for the
            # items we have removed
            deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
            ai = np.arange(len(data))
            mask = np.zeros(len(data), dtype=int)
            mask[deleted] = 1
            indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]
    
        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
            offset += loc
    
        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I've introduced exception handling to catch DataError and SpecificationError. Additionally, I've removed the unnecessary `cast` import, as well as adding handling for the splitting of object-dtype blocks and correction of block indexing.

This should fix the bug and allow the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to cast values safely, and avoid the issues with non-equivalent dtypes.
