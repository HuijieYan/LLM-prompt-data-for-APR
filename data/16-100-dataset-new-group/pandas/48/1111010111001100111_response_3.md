The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is causing a `TypeError` when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with a `dtype='Int64'`. This bug is related to a GitHub issue where the test cases are failing with nullable integer data type.

The potential error locations in the given function are the exception handling within the for loop that aggregates the data blocks and the management of the resulting aggregates in the form of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`.

The cause of the bug is likely due to the management and aggregation of data blocks with the nullable integer data type, leading to an incorrect result and causing a `TypeError` when the `mean` function is used on the `DataFrameGroupBy`.

Considering the glitch in the management and aggregation of data blocks, you can try to address the issue by reworking the exception handling and the way that the data blocks are aggregated, making sure to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately. Additionally, the process of creating `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` should be revised to ensure that the correct results are produced.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate(numeric_only)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks: 
        if numeric_only:
            block = block.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_block, result, locs = compute_agg_block(
            self.grouper, block, how, alt, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is None:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
        else:
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            blk = result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0]
            agg_blocks.append(blk)

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This updated function involves refactoring the operation to handle nullable integer data types. The operation of aggregating the data blocks is simplified, and the handling of split blocks and deleted items is improved.

By correcting the function in this way, the bug should be resolved and the failing test cases in the GitHub issue should pass.
