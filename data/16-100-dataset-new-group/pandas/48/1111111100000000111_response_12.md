There is a bug in the _cython_agg_blocks function. As per the GitHub issue, calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The error occurs when calling min, max, median, and std as well.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of Nullable Integer data type when performing aggregate operations. The function doesn't handle the Nullable Integer type correctly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the data type conversion and handling of nullable integers need to be addressed. Specifically, the function should handle nullable integer data type separately from regular integer data type when performing aggregate operations.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
# Fix the bug related to dtype='Int64' causing TypeError
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Handle Nullable integers separately
        if pd.api.types.is_nullable_integer_dtype(block.values.dtype):
            # Cast the result back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            result = make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, I included a check for nullable integer data type using `pd.api.types.is_nullable_integer_dtype` and handled it separately to ensure proper data type conversion.

This fix addresses the bug identified in the GitHub issue, where calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError.
