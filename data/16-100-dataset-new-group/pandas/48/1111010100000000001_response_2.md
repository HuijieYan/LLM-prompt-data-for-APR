The potential error locations within the buggy function are:
1. The use of `agg_block` before it is assigned a value.
2. The use of `DataFrame` for type hinting without importing it.
3. The error handling logic seems to be a bit convoluted and could be simplified.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `agg_block` variable is being used before the value is assigned to it.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `agg_block` to `None` before the loop and then reassign its value within the loop. Additionally, we need to import `DataFrame` for type hinting.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame  # Import DataFrame for type hinting

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        agg_block = None  # Initialize agg_block to None
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)  # Assign value to agg_block
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ... (previous exception handling logic)

        if agg_block is not None:  # Check if agg_block has been assigned a value
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # ... (previous logic for handling split items)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # ... (previous logic for handling deleted items)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
