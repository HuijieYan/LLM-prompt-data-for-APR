The bug is likely related to the calculation and/or handling of aggregated results inside the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly during aggregation on object-dtype blocks. The function seems to mistakenly unwrap and reshape the results in some cases, which leads to incorrect results and the failing tests. 

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review and potentially refactor the logic responsible for handling aggregated results, especially when dealing with object-dtype blocks. We will also need to ensure that the logic works correctly in edge cases where object blocks may be split into multiple smaller blocks.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    # existing logic
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()

    # new logic for handling aggregated results
    for _, block in data.items():
        if block.dtype.kind == 'O':
            agg_result = block.apply(
                lambda x: x.aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
                if isinstance(x, pd.Series)
                else alt(x, axis=self.axis),
                axis=self.axis
            )
            agg_block = maybe_convert_objects(agg_result, try_float=True)
        else:
            agg_result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block = block.make_block(agg_result)
        
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # remaining logic remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
```

In this corrected version, we introduce a new logic for handling object-dtype blocks by applying aggregation computations directly and processing the results accordingly. We also leverage Pandas' existing utility functions to convert object types to float types when appropriate. This should help address the discrepancy in the results observed during the failing tests.
