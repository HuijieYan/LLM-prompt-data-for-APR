### Analysis:
The `DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` function is called in the `groupby` module when performing aggregation operations. The bug is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`), as reported in the GitHub issue.

#### Potential Error Locations:
1. Handling of nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`).
2. Aggregation calculation for numeric columns.

### Bug Cause:
The bug is due to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`dtype='Int64'`) when performing aggregation operations. The failing test case triggers this bug by calling the `mean` function on the `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer data.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles the nullable integer data type correctly and performs aggregation operations without raising `TypeError` for nullable integer data. This fix will resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.

### Corrected Version of the Function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, min_count=min_count)
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.extend(block.mgr_locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    new_blocks = [block.reindex(indexer) for block in agg_blocks]
    offset = 0
    for blk in new_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return new_blocks, data.items.take(indexer)
```

After applying this fix, the corrected function should handle nullable integer data type and perform aggregation operations for the failing test case without raising any errors.
