Based on the provided information, it appears that there is a bug when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with a `dtype` of `Int64`. This bug results in a TypeError. 

The buggy function seems to be `_cython_agg_blocks` from the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function encounters an exception when trying to calculate the mean for a numeric-only DataFrame with a `dtype` of `Int64`.

Here's a strategy to fix the bug:
1. Modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the `dtype` of `Int64` correctly when calculating the mean.
2. Update the exception handling and data processing to support the `dtype` of `Int64` when calculating the mean.

And here's an example of a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError):
            # Handle specific exceptions related to the dtype of Int64
            # and other non-applicable functions
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result, placement=locs)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # The rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This modified implementation includes handling specific exceptions related to the `dtype` of `Int64` and other non-applicable functions when calculating the mean. It ensures that the function can handle different data types and exceptions appropriately, addressing the bug described in the GitHub issue.

After applying the fix, you should be able to run the failing test cases and verify that the corrected version of the function passes the tests and resolves the GitHub issue.
