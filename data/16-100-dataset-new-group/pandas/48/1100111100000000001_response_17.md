The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the aggregation of data blocks for a DataFrameGroupBy object. The issue arises due to the incorrect aggregation of numeric data and the handling of split blocks. The bug is primarily caused by the incorrect handling of exceptions, the logic for splitting blocks, and the aggregation of non-numeric data.

To fix the bug, the following strategy can be used:
1. Properly handle exceptions to ensure that all possible code paths are covered.
2. Update the logic for splitting blocks and handling non-numeric data aggregation.
3. Ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly for both numeric and non-numeric data.

Here is the corrected version of the function `def _cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None

        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj.iloc[:, np.concatenate(block.mgr_locs.as_array)]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        if result is not None:
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, block.items, block.ref_items)

            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs.as_array)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the following changes have been made:
1. The aggregation is now performed specifically on numeric data using the `select_dtypes` method to filter for numeric data.
2. The handling of exceptions and the logic for alternative aggregation has been revised to ensure that non-numeric data is aggregated properly.
3. The aggregation result is checked for `None` before processing, ensuring that only valid results are used to create new blocks.
4. Lastly, the `as_array` access has been modified to properly access the underlying array of indices for each block.
