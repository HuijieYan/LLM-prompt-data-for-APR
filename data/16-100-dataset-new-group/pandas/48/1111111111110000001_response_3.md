The error is due to the casting of float64 to int64, which results in a TypeError. The failing test is caused by the _cython_agg_blocks method in the DataFrameGroupBy class which uses the function _cython_agg_blocks. 

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the data that is being operated on, and how the final result is being processed.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import GroupBy
from pandas.core.internals import BlockManager
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas.testing import assert_frame_equal

def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ):
    data = self.obj._data
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=np.number)
    agg_blocks = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks

# Testing the corrected version

def test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float():
    values = {
        "a": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
        "b": [1, pd.NA, 2, 1, pd.NA, 2, 1, pd.NA, 2]
    }

    output_values = 0.5
    result = [output_values] * 3
    expected_result = pd.DataFrame({"b": result},
                                   index=pd.Index([1, 2, 3], dtype=object, name="a"))

    df = pd.DataFrame(values, dtype="Int64")
    groups = df.groupby("a")

    for function in ["mean", "median", "var"]:
        result = getattr(groups, function)()
        assert_frame_equal(result, expected_result)

        result = groups.agg(function)
        assert_frame_equal(result, expected_result)

        result = groups.agg([function])
        result_cols = [col[1] for col in result.columns]
        expected_result_cols = [("b", function)]
        assert result_cols == expected_result_cols
```

In this corrected version, the `_cython_agg_blocks` method is updated to work on numeric-only data and the result is aggregated correctly. The test case has been updated to validate the behavior for different aggregation functions.
