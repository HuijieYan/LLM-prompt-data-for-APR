The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integers (`Int64` type) in the `groupby` operation. The issue on GitHub describes that calling functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle nullable integers properly when performing aggregation operations. Specifically, adjustments need to be made to ensure that functions like `mean` work correctly with `Int64` dtype.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=np.number)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []
    deleted_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = np.concatenate(new_items)[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version:

1. The `get_numeric_data` method has been replaced with `select_dtypes`, which will correctly handle nullable integer types without raising a TypeError.
2. The `deleted_items` handling is removed, as it seems unnecessary for this specific bug.
3. Each `block` is aggregated and added to the `agg_blocks` list, and their corresponding `locs` are added to the `new_items` list.
4. After the loop, the indexes are recalculated and combined with the `offset` to set the `mgr_locs` for each aggregated block correctly.

With these changes, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle nullable integers properly and not raise a TypeError when performing aggregation operations. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
