The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be causing incorrect results for the `agg` method of the DataFrameGroupBy class. After analyzing the runtime input/output values for the failing test cases, it appears that the computation of aggregated blocks is incorrect due to issues with how the values and indices are being handled. The block management should be adjusted to ensure that the aggregation is carried out correctly for each group.

To fix the bug, the following actions can be taken:
1. Review the logic for handling the data and aggregated blocks in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. Ensure that the assignment and manipulation of `agg_blocks`, `new_items`, `deleted_items`, and `split_items` are performed correctly.
3. Verify the indexing and alignment of data for aggregation.
4. Confirm that the aggregation logic is consistent with the expected behavior for the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions.
5. Test the corrected function using the provided failing tests to ensure that the issue has been resolved.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    indexer = np.arange(len(data))
    
    for locs in range(len(data.blocks)):
        block = data.blocks[locs]
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        if result is None:
            continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_block.mgr_locs = indexer
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This revised version ensures that the aggregation is performed correctly for each group within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. While this corrected version is provided, it should be thoroughly tested using the failing tests to verify its correctness.
