The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` and other aggregation methods on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype. This error occurs due to the inability to safely cast non-equivalent `float64` to `int64`.

The root cause of the bug is in the way the `safe_cast` function handles the casting of values using the `astype` method, specifically when attempting to cast `float64` to `int64`. This raises a `TypeError` when the casting is done according to the rule 'safe'.

To fix this bug, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be updated to explicitly handle the nullable integer data type when performing the aggregation.

Here's the corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Handle nullable integer data type by casting to float64
            cast_state = None
            try:
                casted = block.values.astype("float64", casting="safe", copy=False)
                cast_state = "float"
            except TypeError:
                casted = block.values
                cast_state = "integer"

            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                casted, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            # Handle how to return non-equivalent float64 as int64
            if cast_state == "float" and isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype == "float64":
                result = result.astype("int64", casting="unsafe")
        except NotImplementedError:
            # ...
        except TypeError:
            # ...

        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

By explicitly handling the casting of nullable integer data type and non-equivalent float64 values, the function can now safely handle the aggregation operations without raising a `TypeError`.

This fix will resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype no longer results in a `TypeError`.

Please note that the full fix may require additional testing and verification.
