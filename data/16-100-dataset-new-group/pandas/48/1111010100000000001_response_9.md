Here's a breakdown of the analysis and fix for the buggy function:

1. The buggy function is a part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which in turn is a subclass of `GroupBy`.
2. The potential error locations within the function include the handling of exceptions, the creation of new items, and the resetting of locs in the blocks.
3. The cause of the bug is related to incorrect indexing, mismatch in data shapes, and potential mishandling of exceptions during aggregation, resulting in improper block management.
4. To fix the bug, I suggest revisiting the exception handling, revalidating the data shapes, and using a more straightforward approach for indexing and managing block locations.
5. Given the analysis, here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for loc, block in data.iteritems():
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(loc)
                continue

            result = block.agg(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
        except DataError:
            continue

        # Process the result and create agg_block
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(loc)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reconstruct agg_blocks and agg_items
    agg_items = data.items[new_items]
    agg_blocks = [blk[agg_items] for blk in agg_blocks]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version focuses on simpler iteration through the data, with proper exception handling and reconstruction of `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` arrays.
