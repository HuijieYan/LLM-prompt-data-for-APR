The issue in the given buggy function involves aggregating data from a DataFrame with grouping keys. The function seems to be raising a `DataError` indicating that there are no numeric types to aggregate. 

From the analyzed runtime values and types, it appears that the `BlockManager` instance `data` does have numeric data. However, an error may be occurring during the aggregation process. The cause of this bug could be related to the `for` loop that contains a try-except block for aggregating values. The exception handling and the condition checks within the loop may be causing a premature exit without properly aggregating the values.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug may involve reviewing the exception handling logic within the for loop to ensure that it captures exceptions appropriately without prematurely aborting the aggregation process.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # handle the result for different aggregation methods including exceptions
        try:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            
            if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue

            assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # clean up the mess left over from split blocks
    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
            agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version updates the exception handling logic within the for loop and ensures that the aggregation process proceeds correctly. It also addresses the splitting of blocks and allocates the correct aggregated items and blocks.
