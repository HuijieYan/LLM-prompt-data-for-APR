The errors appear to be related to the incompatibility between the float64 and int64 datatypes for the provided data, producing a `TypeError` because the function `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)` is not able to perform the casting.

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` operates on a dataframe to perform an aggregation based on numeric data. It's likely that the error is occurring when trying to perform a safe cast from float64 to int64. To fix this, we need to ensure that the data is compatible with the expected type for the specific operation, or to avoid trying to cast incompatible types to each other.

Let's correct the `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)` line by circumventing the underlying issue. Instead of using `astype`, we will use `numpy.where` combined with simple checks to force the values into the expected type.

Here's the corrected version of `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
# Corrected version of the buggy function
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame
from pandas.core.groupby.groupby import GroupBy
from pandas.core.internals import BlockManager, Block

class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
                
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                    alt_result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                    
                    if isinstance(alt_result, DataFrame):
                        alt_result = alt_result._data.blocks[0].values
                        if isinstance(alt_result, np.ndarray) and alt_result.ndim == 1:
                            alt_result = alt_result.reshape(1, -1)
                    
                    result = alt_result

            block_dtype = block.dtype
            safe_cast_func = lambda x: np.where(x, x.astype(block_dtype), 0)
            try:
                agg_block_values = safe_cast_func(result)
                agg_block = block.make_block(agg_block_values)
            except TypeError as err:
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot safely cast non-equivalent {block.values.dtype} to {np.dtype(block_dtype)}"
                ) from err

            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
        # current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(indexer)))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version of the function, we've replaced the `values.astype()` call with a `np.where` operation combined with a simple check and a lambda function to ensure that the values are cast to the expected type. We also removed the use of additional lists such as `deleted_items`, `split_items`, etc., and proceeded with only `agg_blocks` and `new_items`.

The primary goal is to ensure that incompatible types are not being cast to each other. This modification should resolve the casting issues that are leading to the `TypeError` being raised.

Once the corrected version is applied, rerun the failing tests to confirm that it resolves the issue.
