## Analysis and Explanations
The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The issue is specific to the new nullable integer data type and occurs when performing operations like mean, median, and std. The problem does not occur when using int64 dtype or when taking a single column to give a `SeriesGroupBy`.

The cause of the bug in the `cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to the handling of nullable integer types in the aggregation process. The bug causes a TypeError when performing operations like mean on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer (Int64) dtype.

## Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the nullable integer type correctly during the aggregation process. This may involve checking for the nullable integer type and applying the aggregation operations accordingly.

## Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    for key, block in data.items():
        if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
            data._set(blk=data._ensure_block(item, block), obj_type=pd.Series)

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    ...
```

In the corrected version, we check for the integer data type and handle it appropriately during the aggregation process. This should resolve the TypeError issue when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with Int64 dtype.
