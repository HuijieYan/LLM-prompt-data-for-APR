The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` contains several potential error locations. For example, there are multiple complex loops, try-except blocks, and conditional statements that might lead to unexpected control flow or data manipulation errors.

One potential cause of the bug is the mishandling of exception cases, such as when the `NotImplementedError` or `TypeError` exceptions are raised. These exceptions are caught, and the program continues, but it may lead to incorrect outcomes if the alternative paths are not correctly handled.

To fix the bug, it's important to carefully review the exception handling, loop iterations, and conditional statements to ensure that the control flow and data manipulation are correct in all cases. Additionally, it's important to verify the correct ordering and indexing of the data to ensure that the final results are accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
from pandas import DataError

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    idx_map: Mapping[int, int] = dict()
  
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reorder the new items to match the ordering of the original frame
    ordered_items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(ordered_items))

    # Reassign the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = ordered_items[offset: offset + loc]
        idx_map[i] = offset
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, the exception handling is simplified, and the aggregation logic is orchestrated in a more straightforward manner. Additionally, the indexing and ordering of the data items are handled more explicitly to ensure correctness.
