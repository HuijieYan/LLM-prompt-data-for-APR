The issue reported on GitHub describes a problem with calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object after grouping data with `Int64` dtype. The expected result is to obtain the mean of numeric values in the grouped columns, but the actual result is a `TypeError` being raised.

### Bug Analysis
The error occurs because the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is unable to handle grouping with `Int64` dtype, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The function logic seems to be working as intended in most cases, but there is an error with the specific use case of `Int64` dtype.

### Bug Identification
The cause of the bug lies within the function `_cython_agg_blocks`. The specific part of the code where the issue is occurring is not immediately clear, but based on the user's reported issue, it seems to be related to the way the function is processing the `Int64` dtype when calculating the mean.

### Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Identify the part of the code where the function is processing the different data types for aggregation, especially the handling of `Int64` dtype.
2. Modify the code to handle the `Int64` dtype in a way that allows the calculation of the mean correctly.

### Corrected Version
Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should address the issue reported on GitHub:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:

        # Handle dtype-specific aggregation
        if block.dtype.name.startswith('Int'):
            result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count)
        else:
            # For other data types
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                # Handle other cases
                pass

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged 

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, specific handling for the `Int64` dtype is added to allow proper aggregation of the data. This change should resolve the reported issue with calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.

Please note that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function may have other dependencies within the context of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The corrected version provided focuses on the specific issue reported on GitHub and may need to be integrated with the complete function for a seamless fix.
