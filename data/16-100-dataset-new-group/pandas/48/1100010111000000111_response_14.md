The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing an error when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype. The issue is identified in the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

The buggy function seems to encounter issues when dealing with the `Int64` dtype while performing group-wise operations. The `TypeError` arises when trying to perform aggregation operations with functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the `Int64` dtype properly during the aggregation process in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = block.mgr_locs.apply(
            lambda x: self.grouper.aggregate(x, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            if pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(x.dtype) and pd.api.types.is_nullable(x.dtype)
            else np.nan
        )
        if result.isna().all():
            # exclude the block if all results are nan
            deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        else:
            result = cast("Block", result)
            agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    new_locs = sorted(set().union(*[indexer.tolist() for indexer in new_items]))
    agg_items = data.items.take(new_locs)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = new_locs[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The correction involves using the `mgr_locs.apply` method to handle the integer and nullable integer data types appropriately. It checks for these data types and applies the aggregation operation accordingly.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub when performing group-wise operations with integer and nullable integer data types.
