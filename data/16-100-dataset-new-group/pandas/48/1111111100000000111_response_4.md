### Analyzing the buggy function and its relationship with related functions, the GitHub issue:

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, which is a subclass of the `GroupBy` class. Its purpose is to perform aggregation on the grouped data. The GitHub issue indicates that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`. This aligns with the problem description provided in the GitHub issue.

### Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function:

The potential error locations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function could be related to the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`). This may involve issues with casting data back to the original dtype and the handling of split blocks.

### Explaining the cause of the bug using the buggy function, the related functions, the GitHub Issue information:

The bug likely occurs due to a problem in converting the result of aggregation back to the original data type, especially when dealing with nullable integer data type (`Int64`). This leads to a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of type `Int64`.

### Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the aggregation process correctly handles nullable integer data types.
2. Validate and cast the result of aggregation to the appropriate data type.
3. Handle split blocks with nullable integer data type properly.

### Corrected version of the function:
