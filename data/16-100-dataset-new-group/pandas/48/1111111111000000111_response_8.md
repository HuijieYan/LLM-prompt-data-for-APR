The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class is failing to handle nullable integer data (`dtype='Int64'`) correctly, resulting in a `TypeError` when applying aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var`. The issue has been reported on GitHub as "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

The bug most likely occurs because the function is not correctly handling the nullable integer data types and is unable to aggregate them properly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` can handle nullable integer data types (`dtype='Int64'`) correctly when performing aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, or `var`. This may involve making sure that the function handles nullable data and aggregation in a way that aligns with the behavior of other aggregation functions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        data_to_agg = data._convert(should_cast=True, copy=True)

        if numeric_only:
            data_to_agg = data_to_agg._get_numeric_data()

        agg_blocks = []
        agg_labels = []
        split_frames = []

        for label, block in data_to_agg.items():
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, min_count=min_count
                )
            except TypeError:
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            
            agg_labels.append(label)
            agg_blocks.append(result)

        results = [make_block(res, loc=l, klass=type(self.obj)) for res, l in zip(agg_blocks, agg_labels)]

        return results, data.items
```

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should handle nullable integer data types correctly when performing aggregation functions, ensuring that the functions like `mean`, `median`, and `var` work as expected. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
