Issue Analysis:
The issue is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The expected output is the mean of the 'b' column for each group of 'a'.

Potential Error Locations:
The error could be caused by how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class handles the grouping and aggregation, particularly with respect to the handling of nullable integer data types.

Explanation of the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types when grouping and applying aggregation functions. The function is not properly handling the Int64 dtype when grouping and applying the `mean` function.

Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug can be fixed by explicitly checking for the nullable integer data type and handling it appropriately while aggregating. Additionally, the function should ensure that the mean calculation works as expected for all data types.

Given the understanding of the bug and the required fix, below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, this should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the code (no changes here)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # rest of the code (no changes here)

            if is_integer_dtype(block.values.dtype) and is_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
                # Handle nullable integer types separately
                result = result.astype('Float64')  # Convert the result to a float if it's nullable int

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # rest of the code (no changes here)
```

In the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, an additional check is added to handle nullable integer types separately. If the original block and the result are both of nullable integer type, the result is converted to a float using `astype('Float64')` before creating the aggregation block.

This fix addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
