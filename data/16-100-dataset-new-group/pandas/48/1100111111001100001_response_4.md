The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` fails to provide accurate results due to errors caused by a block manager when processing data. The errors predominantly revolve around handling the numeric data, which leads to incorrect results being returned by the function.

The buggy function appears to be iterating through blocks, trying to determine aggregates for each block based on the specified `how` function ("mean", "median", "var"). However, there are several issues with converting the blocks to the final output `agg_blocks` and `agg_items`.

A potential issue is the logic within the loop to handle numerical data and cast back to the original data type. It seems there is a mismatch between the expected outcome for aggregation and the actual outcome due to handling extensions and blocks.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to provide a new implementation with revised logic to handle the aggregation of the blocks correctly based on the specified `how` function while considering the nature of the data within the DataFrame and BlockManager. The new logic should focus on accurately performing the aggregation based on the desired function without encountering errors related to data type conversion and extension blocks.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        values = block.values
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.arange(len(agg_blocks))
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function's logic has been modified to accurately perform aggregation based on the specified `how` function without encountering issues related to data type conversion and extension blocks. The aggregation is handled directly within the loop, and the resulting blocks and items are returned as the final output.
