The issue in the buggy function can be identified as occurring when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The cause of the bug is related to the handling of nullable integer data type when calling aggregate functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves correcting the data handling and aggregation logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, the code needs to be modified to handle nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only and not all(data.get_dtype_counts().empty):
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, block_values = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False)
        result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)

        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function logic has been updated to handle the nullable integer data type correctly when calling the aggregation function. It also ensures that the dtype is maintained during the aggregation process.

With these changes, the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
