The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function could be related to the aggregation calculation when calling the mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, and it results in a TypeError as reported in the GitHub issue.

Upon analyzing the function and the GitHub issue, it's evident that the bug is likely occurring when trying to perform the aggregation with the `mean` function on blocks of data. The issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function may be related to the handling of nullable integer data types, specifically when using the `mean` function.

The strategy for fixing the bug would involve checking for the data type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and implementing any necessary conversions to handle nullable integer data types when performing the aggregation. Additionally, ensuring proper error handling and handling of nullable integer data types for the `mean` function would be necessary.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that attempts to address the bug based on the analysis:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Check if data contains Nullable integer dtype
    if data._is_integer_na_dtype:
        # Replace NA values with suitable placeholders to avoid TypeError
        data.fillna(-1, inplace=True)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we've added a check to see if the input data contains nullable integer dtype and replaced NA values with a suitable placeholder (in this case, -1) to avoid the TypeError. Additional modifications might be necessary based on further testing and edge cases.
