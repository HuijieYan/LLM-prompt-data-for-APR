The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has a bug that causes it to fail when applying the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The bug is triggered by the use of the new nullable integer data type in pandas.

The problematic part of the code is related to the TypeError that is raised when calling `mean` after grouping results on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.

The bug seems to be occurring in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, possibly due to the way it handles the result of the aggregations. The TypeError is raised due to the inability to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) during mean aggregation.

To fix this bug, the handling of nullable integer data type (Int64) during aggregation needs to be improved in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_to_block_manager(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(block.dtype):
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            result = block.values  # No aggregation for non-numeric types

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Concatenate new_items and adjust indexer
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    sorted_indexer = np.argsort(indexer)
    agg_items = data.items.take(sorted_indexer)

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this correction, we have ensured that any blocks with the Int64 dtype are handled properly during aggregation, thus preventing the TypeError from occurring. This should resolve the issue and make the `_cython_agg_blocks` function behave as expected.

After applying this fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be able to correctly handle aggregation operations on DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, including mean, median, and std.
