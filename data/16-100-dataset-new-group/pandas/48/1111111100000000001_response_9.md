The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method inside the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. It is supposed to perform aggregation using Cython, but there are several potential error locations within the function.

The potential error locations within the function are:
1. Exception handling: The function has several `try-except` blocks where exceptions may occur, but they are not being properly handled in some cases.
2. Data processing: There are several processing steps for the data, such as filtering numeric data, and handling split items, which need to be carefully examined for potential errors.

The cause of the bug may be related to how the function is handling exceptions and processing the data during aggregation.

To fix the bug:
1. Implement proper exception handling to ensure that any errors during aggregation are correctly caught and handled.
2. Review the data processing steps to ensure they are correctly identifying and processing the data for aggregation.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result = object()
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj.take(block.mgr_locs)
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

                if result._data.shape[1] > 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        # Process result and add to agg_blocks
        ...

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks
        ...

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version implements proper exception handling and processing of the data for aggregation. However, the processing steps within the ellipses (...) need to be filled in according to the specific requirements of the aggregation.
