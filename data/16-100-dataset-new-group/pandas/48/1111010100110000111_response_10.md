The bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` leads to a `TypeError` when applying the `mean` function to a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, generating an error message stating that it cannot cast non-equivalent float64 to int64 according to the rule 'safe'. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

The root cause of this bug is that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` tries to apply a numeric aggregation on the groupby data, which includes some non-numeric types due to the nullable integer data type. This causes a conflict when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to handle the nullable integer data type properly when performing the groupby aggregation. Specifically, it needs to consider the type casting rules for the nullable integer data type and avoid attempting to cast non-equivalent types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_categorical_dtype, is_integer, is_float

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if is_categorical_dtype(block.dtype):
                if how in {"mean", "var", "std"}:
                    result, _ = self.grouper.group_transform(
                        block.values.tolist(), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                    )
                else:
                    # let other functions fallback to non-cython path
                    result = no_result
            elif is_integer(block.dtype) and is_float(reduction_func):
                # use group_transform for integer to avoid TypeError
                result, _ = self.grouper.group_transform(
                    block.values.astype("float64"), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # handle NotImplementedError
    
        # ... (other code remains the same)
```

In this corrected version:
1. We have added a condition to handle the case when the block's dtype is categorical. Categorical data requires a different approach for some aggregation functions, so we handle it separately.
2. We have also added a condition to handle the conflict between integer and float types. If the reduction function expects a float return type, we convert the integer values to `float64` to avoid a TypeError during casting.

By handling these different data type cases appropriately, we can fix the issue with the TypeError when applying aggregation functions to a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. This should address the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
