The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to occur when applying the agg method (using either `mean`, `median`, or `var`) to a DataFrame with nullable integer values (dtype="Int64"). The function seems to struggle with handling nullable integer values when applying aggregation methods.

It is likely that the bug occurs in the `maybe_downcast_numeric`  and `result = type(block.values)._from_sequence()` sections, as these sections seem to be performing operations on the block values and trying to handle nullable integer values.

The strategy for fixing the bug could be to update the casting and handling of nullable integer values within the function, ensuring that the function is able to properly handle nullable integer values, especially when applying aggregation methods.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
                if isinstance(result, pd.Series):
                    result = DataFrame({result.name: result})
        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rest of the function remains the same
    ...
    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

By making these changes, the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function should be able to properly handle nullable integer values when applying aggregation methods, passing the failing tests.
