The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is experiencing a TypeError when casting values from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64'. This is likely due to the handling of nullable integers in the function. The relevant GitHub issue also confirms the problem occurs while calling the mean method on a DataFrameGroupBy with an Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the nullable integers properly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. We should ensure that when casting values, we account for nullable integer types and maintain compatibility for both integer and floating-point data types. The fix should address the specific handling of Int64 data type when aggregating values within a DataFrameGroupBy.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Handle nullable integers when computing the aggregate
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            if isinstance(result, pd.Series) and result.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                result = result.astype('float', errors='ignore')
        except NotImplementedError:
            # The rest of the function's implementation, as is
            # ...
```

By specifically handling the nullable integer types before and during the aggregation process, we can prevent the TypeError occurring when casting between float and int data types.

After implementing this fix, re-run the failing test cases to ensure that the modified `_cython_agg_blocks` function passes the tests and resolves the issue described on GitHub.
