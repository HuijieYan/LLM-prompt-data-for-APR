## Bug Explanation
The bug is likely related to the handling of the `mean` aggregation function in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The bug seems to be causing a `TypeError` when trying to call `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype. This is consistent with the failing test cases.

The `numeric_only` argument is set to `True`, which means that only numeric data should be considered for the aggregation. However, the test case input includes non-numeric (`<NA>`) data in the dataframe, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `VertBlock` dtype might not be handled appropriately for the `mean` aggregation function, leading to a `TypeError`.

## Bug Fix
To fix the bug, it may be necessary to modify the logic for handling nullable integer data during the `mean` aggregation. The function should be modified to handle `Int64` dtype appropriately when calculating the mean. This might involve checking for the presence of `Int64` dtype and handling it differently from other numeric types.

The `numeric_only` argument may also need to be reconsidered. For cases where non-numeric (`<NA>`) data is present in the dataframe, the function should behave appropriately, potentially by handling missing values differently.

## Updated Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Assuming `block` is a VertBlock
        result = None
        if isinstance(block, VertBlock):
            block_values = block.values
            if hasattr(block_values, "hasna") and block_values.hasna:
                # Handle Nullable IntegerArray appropriately
                result = block_values.astype(float).mean(axis=1)
            else:
                result = block_values.mean(axis=1)
        else:
            result = block_values.mean(axis=1)

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items
    # Reset block locs
    for i in range(len(agg_blocks)):
        offset = i * len(agg_blocks[i])
        agg_blocks[i].mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + len(agg_blocks[i]))]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
This code snippet presents a rough fix to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where the logic for handling nullable integer data during the mean aggregation has been updated. Additionally, this updated code may handle the presence of `<NA>` values appropriately.
