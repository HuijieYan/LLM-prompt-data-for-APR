1. The buggy function is the `_cython_agg_blocks` function defined in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. 
2. The potential error in this function could be occurring when values are being cast and converted between types, specifically from float to int.
3. The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to convert values from float64 to int64, which is resulting in a TypeError. This is seen in the failing tests where arrays of float values are being processed, leading to a data casting error.
4. In order to fix the bug, the function should check the types of the values before trying to cast them and perform the necessary conversions or error handling based on the input types.
5. Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # rest of the code...

        # Inside the loop, before trying to cast the values
        if block.values.dtype == np.float64:
            result = cast_float_to_int(block.values)
            if result is None:
                # Handle error case
                continue
        else:
            result = block.values

        # rest of the code...
        
    # the rest of the function...

def cast_float_to_int(values: np.ndarray):
    try:
        return values.astype(np.int64)
    except TypeError as err:
        # Convert the values to expected int64 equivalent
        new_values = values.round().astype(np.int64)
        if np.array_equal(values, new_values):
            return new_values
        return None
```

In the corrected version, I've added a `cast_float_to_int` function to handle the casting from float to int, and introduced a check before casting to handle the error case if the data cannot be safely cast. This revised logic checks for float values and decides whether to convert them to int64 using a new function.
