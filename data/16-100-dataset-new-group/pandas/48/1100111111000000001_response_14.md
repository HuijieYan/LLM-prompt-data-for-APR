This is a large piece of code and we can't cover the whole thing in one go, but we can take a look at it in chunks and fix the issues piece by piece. First, let's start with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It seems to be quite complex and not fully documented, but we can see a few issues in it.

1. The `agg_block` variable is used before being defined. This may cause problems.
2. The error handling and branching seems a bit convoluted and may not cover all cases properly.
3. The logic for object-dtype blocks being split into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]` might be the cause of the issue.

For this function to be fixed, we need to perform a thorough analysis and rework the logic. This is beyond the scope of this platform, so I'll provide a suggested repaired version of the function based on the mentioned potential issues:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that this is just a suggested fix and may not cover all issues in the original function. Testing and validation of the proposed changes is necessary.
