Strategy for fixing the bug:
The buggy function should produce aggregate blocks and items based on the input DataFrame, aggregation method, and any relevant parameters.

The function appears to be attempting to aggregate the data for a specific group-by columns based on the 'how' parameter, resulting in 'agg_blocks' and 'agg_items'. However, the function has some issues, such as mistakenly checking for the presence of a result instead of its absence in some cases.

The cause of the bug is that the function does not handle all possible aggregation methods correctly. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the results of specific aggregation operations.

A useful strategy for fixing the bug would involve ensuring that the function correctly handles all aggregation methods while producing the proper aggregate blocks and items. Checking the border cases and outlier inputs may also help identify any additional issues with the function.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for idx, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[idx * loc: (idx + 1) * loc]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
This corrected version of the function removes any unnecessary conditions and refactors the logic to properly handle all aggregation methods and produce the desired result. It also ensures the handling of the indices and items during the aggregation process.
