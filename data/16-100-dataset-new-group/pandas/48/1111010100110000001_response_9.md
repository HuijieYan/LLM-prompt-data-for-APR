Here is the fixed version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
    
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
The original function contained a loop that raised an exception that was being caught but should have been handled differently. It also had unused variables and exceptions raised without suitable explanation.

The updated function removes some unused variables and simplifies the loop, handling the situation where the custom `alt` method is provided and then continues to build the `agg_blocks`. Finally, it handles the situation when there are no `agg_blocks` and raises a `DataError` instead of the exception to account for the case when there are no numeric types to aggregate.
