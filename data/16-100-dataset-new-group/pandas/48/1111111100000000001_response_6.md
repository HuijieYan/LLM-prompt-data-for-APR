Based on the source code, the potential error locations within the buggy function are:

1. Error handling within the loop that involves catching and raising exceptions.
2. The logic for handling "split" frames and items within split_blocks.
3. Dealing with the condition `(agg_blocks or split_frames)` and raising a `DataError` if none of these exist.

The cause of the bug is likely related to the handling of exceptions and the conditional logic in the function. One potential issue could be that the error handling within the loop may not be robust enough to account for all potential exceptions, leading to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the handling of split frames and split items appears to be complex and may not be functioning as expected.

A suggested strategy for fixing the bug would be to carefully review the error handling within the loop, ensuring that all potential exceptions are properly handled, providing helpful error messages or handling them appropriately. The logic for handling split frames and split items should be simplified and streamlined to reduce complexity and potential for errors. Lastly, the condition `(agg_blocks or split_frames)` should be reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the desired behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            result = self._handle_aggregate_not_implemented(
                block, how, alt, alt is None, locs
            )
    
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
    

def _handle_aggregate_not_implemented(
    self, block, how, alt, alt_is_none, locs
):
    if alt_is_none:
        raise NotImplementedError("Operation is not implemented")
        
    obj = self.obj[block]
    s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
    
    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=1))
    result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
    
    return result
```

In the corrected version, the error handling within the loop is streamlined, and the logic for handling split frames is removed. The condition `(agg_blocks or split_frames)` is replaced with a straightforward check for the existence of `agg_blocks`. Additionally, a helper function `_handle_aggregate_not_implemented` is created to handle the case when an error occurs due to `NotImplementedError`. This improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
