To fix the issue with the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it seems that the error revolves around the safe casting of values from float64 to int64. The conversion is failing because the safe rule disallows the conversion.

One potential strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the case where the dtype is 'Int64' explicitly. This may involve checking the dtype of the values and modifying the conversion accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    
        no_result = object()
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = no_result
            locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
            values_to_process = block.values
    
            if values_to_process.dtype == 'object':
                try:
                    converted = values_to_process.astype('Int64')
                except (TypeError, ValueError):
                    # handle the conversion issues
                    converted = values_to_process
    
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    converted, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
                    
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            
            # ... (the rest of the function remains the same)
```

In this corrected implementation, when processing the `values_to_process`, we explicitly check if the dtype is 'object', and then attempt the conversion to 'Int64'. If the conversion fails, we continue with the original values.

This approach ensures that we handle the 'Int64' dtype situation explicitly, which should resolve the safe casting error encountered in the failing tests.
