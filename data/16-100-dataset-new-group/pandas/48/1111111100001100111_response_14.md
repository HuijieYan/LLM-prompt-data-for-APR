Based on the GitHub issue and the runtime input/output values, it appears that the bug is related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The issue seems to be occurring with other aggregation functions such as median and std as well. The bug also seems to affect nullable integer data types, but works with regular int64 dtype.

The bug appears to be related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The TypeError is likely due to a mismatch in data type handling when performing aggregation operations on nullable integer data types.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the nullable integer data type (Int64) properly when performing aggregation operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except TypeError:
            # If TypeError occurs, try to perform the operation on a single column
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.agg(how)
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

This corrected version should handle the aggregation operations properly when dealing with the nullable integer data types (Int64) and should resolve the TypeError issue when calling various aggregation functions like mean, median, and std on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.
