The issue appears to be the TypeError exception that occurs because it is trying to safely cast an array from dtype 'float64' to dtype 'int64' according to the rule 'safe'. 

Given that the values are varied and the cast operation is returning a TypeError from the safe_cast function because the array cannot be safely cast from float64 to int64.

A strategy to fix the bug is to review the safe_cast function and modify if required to handle the casting of float64 to int64 in this specific scenario.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Reviewing the updated _cython_agg_blocks function, the try-except block for casting the values is removed and we directly perform the data aggregation and block creation. The unnecessary manipulations are removed, so there should not be any type casting issues.
