The bug seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype. The error results in a TypeError. The issue does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but also occurs with median and std.

The potential error locations within the buggy function are related to the implementation of the `cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically how it handles the aggregation of data blocks.

The bug is likely caused by a mismatch between the handling of the Int64 dtype when calling the `mean` function. It appears that the function is not handling the nullable integer data type properly, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be modified to properly handle the nullable integer data type when performing aggregations such as mean, median, and std.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    if not all(data._is_homogeneous_type()):
        return super()._cython_agg_blocks(
            how=how, alt=alt, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count
        )

    result_blocks = []
    for g, b in data.items():
        if isinstance(b.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            subset = self.obj[b]
            result = subset.groupby(self.grouper).aggregate(how, axis=self.axis)

            # Downcast the resulting groupby to float
            result = maybe_downcast_objects(result, downcast=pd.Float64Dtype())
            result = result.to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1)

            result_block = make_block(result, placement=subset.placement)
            result_blocks.append(result_block)
        else:
            result_blocks.append(b.make_block(None))

    result_blocks, new_items = self._concat_blocks(result_blocks)
    return result_blocks, new_items
```
This corrected version checks for the Int64Dtype and handles it separately by performing the aggregation and proper downcasting to float as necessary, which addresses the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
