The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is encountering a TypeError when aggregating on a nullable integer column using the `mean` function. The issue arises when calling the `mean` method after grouping a DataFrame with columns of nullable integer dtype (`Int64`). The error does not occur when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`, but it does occur with `median` and `std` as well.

#### Potential Error Location
The error may be occurring in the logic associated with aggregating the data, such as in the section where it checks for the dtype and performs numeric aggregation.

#### Cause of the Bug
The cause of the bug is likely an issue with handling the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when using the `mean` function within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, specifically with the logic surrounding aggregation and data type handling.

#### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the handling of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) should be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure that mean aggregation and other functions work correctly with this data type.

#### Updated Buggy Function
Below is an updated version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that addresses the bug:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    result = data.agg(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only)
    result_blocks = list(result._data.blocks)

    # Update the logic to handle nullable integer data type
    for block in result_blocks:
        # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
        result = maybe_convert_objects(block)
        result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

        if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, block.dtype)
            result_blocks.append(Block(result))

    agg_blocks = result_blocks

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In this updated version, modification is made to properly handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when aggregating using the `mean` function or other aggregation functions. This should resolve the TypeErrors that arise when aggregating nullable integer data using the `_cython_agg_blocks` method.
