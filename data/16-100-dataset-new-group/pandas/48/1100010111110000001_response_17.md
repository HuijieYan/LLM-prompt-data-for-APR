The current implementation has exceptions due to trying to convert non-equivalent values among data types. 

The cause of the AssertionError in the failing test and the corresponding error message is due to the wrong casting of the data with float64 to int64, reference to line #144: `values, mask = coerce_to_array(values, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)` in pandas/core/arrays/integer.py. 

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that we properly handle the conversion of float64 to int64 to avoid the TypeError related to casting non-equivalent values.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle numeric conversions safely. Specifically, we need to handle the case where the dtype of the `values` is `float64`, and it needs to be converted to `integer` dtype based on the provided logic. For `float64` to `integer` casting, we should round off the values and then convert them to integer. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Original implementation...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Original implementation...
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            
            # Safely cast or handle numeric conversion
            if np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating) and result.dtype.kind in 'fd':
                # If the result dtype is a floating point type, convert it to an integer
                result = result.round().astype("int64")
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Original implementation...

        if result is not no_result:
            # Original implementation...
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Original implementation...
```

By adding the specific handling for numeric conversions within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, we ensure that the DataError caused by non-equivalent types is resolved, and the TypeError due to improper casting from `float64` to `int64` is also addressed.
