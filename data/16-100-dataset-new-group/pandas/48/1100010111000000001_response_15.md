After analyzing the `generic.py` file and the failing test code, the potential error in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the handling of non-numeric data types and the aggregation operations. The bug may be causing incorrect or unexpected results when handling certain data types during aggregation operations.

The cause of the bug is using object-dtype blocks that might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]], and the failing test aims to apply the aggregation function to nullable integer values, which is not handled correctly by the current implementation of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for handling non-numeric data types and ensure that the aggregation functions work correctly for the specified data types. Specifically, the `split_items` and `split_frames` logic needs to be adjusted to correctly handle non-numeric values, and the aggregation operation should be validated to work as expected for nullable integer values.

Given the buggy function and the identified issues, here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                # ValueError indicating the inability to perform the operation
                raise ValueError(f"Cannot perform '{how}' operation")

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                # reductions; see GH#28949
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[i : i + len(blk.mgr_locs)]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected function specifically addresses handling non-numeric data types and ensures that the aggregation operations work as expected for nullable integer values, among other data types.

This corrected function aims to handle various data types properly and improve the success rate of the failing tests involving aggregation operations on nullable integer values.
