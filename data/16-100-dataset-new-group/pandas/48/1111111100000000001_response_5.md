The cause of the bug is suspected to be related to the handling of split items and split frames in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Further investigation is required to understand the exact cause, which could be related to incorrect indexing or incorrect data alignment.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug could involve debugging the code to understand how split items and split frames are being handled, and then ensuring that the indexing, alignment, and data manipulation operations are correct.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    # Access data for aggregation
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List = []
    deleted_items: List = []
    split_items: List = []
    split_frames: List = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                # Manually exclude the block if the operation cannot be performed alternatively
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

            # Perform the operation using the alternative method
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.to_numpy()  # Convert DataFrame to numpy array

        agg_block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)

        new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)  # Add the locations to new_items
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Perform further processing and error handling
    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
            new_items.append(np.array([loc]))
            agg_blocks.append(make_block(result.iloc[:, [i]].to_numpy(), placement=loc))

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)  # Concatenate new_items to create indexer
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer).sort_values()

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : offset + loc]  # Update the locs in the blocks
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses potential issues related to indexing and split item handling, ensuring that the resultant `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are correctly computed and aligned. However, further testing may be necessary to ensure that the corrected function behaves as expected.
