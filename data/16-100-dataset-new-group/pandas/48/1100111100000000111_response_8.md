## Analysis
The issue reported on GitHub indicates that calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in a TypeError. The bug occurs when using the new nullable integer data type in pandas. The bug does not occur when calling min, max, or first, but does occur with median and std.

## Potential Error Locations
The bug might occur in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

## Bug Cause
The bug might be caused by the incorrect handling of the new nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, leading to a TypeError when calling mean.

## Suggested Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the logic related to handling the nullable integer data type (Int64) in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
2. Ensure that the function properly handles the nullable integer data type when performing aggregations like mean, median, and std.

## Corrected Version
```python
# Assuming the following imports are still available in the current environment

# The corrected version of the function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = self._grouped_and_aggregated(block.values, how, alt, min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def _grouped_and_aggregated(
    self, values: np.ndarray, how: str, alt=None, min_count: int
) -> np.ndarray:
    try:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
    except NotImplementedError:
        # handle the operations that are not applicable
        result = self._try_alternate_agg(values, alt)
    return result
```

In the corrected version, the logic for grouped and aggregated operations has been moved to a separate function `_grouped_and_aggregated` to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) properly. This should address the bug reported on GitHub.
