The bug in the given function is causing a `TypeError` when grouping the DataFrame using the `mean` function. The bug occurs when calling the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to aggregate the data by a certain function such as `mean`, `median`, or `std`. Based on the provided runtime input/output variable values, the bug appears to manifest in a few areas, including the operations related to splitting object-dtype blocks into multiple blocks, casting the block back to the original dtype, and managing the array indices.

To resolve the bug, the following strategy is suggested:
1. Ensure that data splitting and casting operations are handled correctly when splitting object-dtype blocks.
2. Verify that the array indices are accurately managed during the process of data aggregation.
3. Consider using a different approach to handle nullable integer data types, ensuring that it complies with the behavior expected when using aggregation functions.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        # Perform the aggregation based on the given function
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        # Append the aggregated block and its corresponding locations to the lists
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(locs)

    # Concatenate the new items to form the indexer
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Update the locations in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates directly through the blocks in the data and performs the aggregation based on the given function. It then constructs the indexer and updates the locations in the aggregated blocks accordingly before returning the results.

By making these changes, the function should now handle the aggregation of the DataFrameGroupBy properly and avoid the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
