The `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` error message indicates that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is failing to cast an array from float64 to int64. This is a clear indication that there is a type casting issue related to integer and float values.

An appropriate strategy for fixing this bug would be to add a check that verifies the dtype of the input data and ensures that the output matches the expected dtype according to the native safe casts between the two types. 

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            ...
        ...

        if result is not None:
            dtype = result.dtype
            if block.dtype == np.int_ and dtype in (np.int, np.float):
                # Safely cast the result to the block's dtype
                result = result.astype(block.dtype, casting="safe")
            else:
                raise DataError(f"Cannot safely cast non-equivalent {dtype} to {block.dtype}")
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
    ...

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.sort(np.concatenate(new_items)))
```

In the corrected version, we've added a check to cast the result to the block's dtype using `astype` only if it is safe. If it's not safe, a `DataError` is raised indicating that the conversion is not possible.

By adding this check, we can ensure that the casting from float64 to int64 occurs safely and prevent the `TypeError` due to non-equivalent dtype casting. This should resolve the bug and make the function pass the failing test.
