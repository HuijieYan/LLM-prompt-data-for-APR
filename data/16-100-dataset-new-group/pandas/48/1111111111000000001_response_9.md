The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class within the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` file. It is called by other functions within the same class, such as `aggregate` and `_get_data_to_aggregate`.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the error may be related to the aggregation process, particularly when handling nullable integer values and attempting to apply aggregation functions such as mean, median, or variance.

The bug causes the function to not handle nullable integer values correctly, leading to incorrect results when applying aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, I would suggest reviewing the code related to handling nullable integer values during aggregation. It might be necessary to implement custom handling for nullable values to ensure the correctness of the aggregation results.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
        # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine
    
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
        for block in data.blocks:
            
            if pd.api.types.is_float_dtype(block.dtype):
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            elif pd.api.types.is_integer_dtype(block.dtype):
                # handle nullable integer values
                is_na = pd.isna(block.values)
                result = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    np.where(is_na, np.nan, block.values), how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
                result = np.where(np.all(is_na), np.nan, result)
            else:
                result = None

            if result is not None:
                agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
        # current ordering
        indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
        agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

        offset = 0
        for blk in agg_blocks:
            loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
            blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
            offset += loc

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this fixed version, the function now explicitly handles nullable integer values by replacing them with `np.nan` before performing the aggregation. Additionally, it checks for the data type of the block and handles float and integer types differently. After these changes, the function should pass the failing test cases.
