The bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is occurring due to the incorrect assumption made regarding the splitting of object-dtype blocks into `List[Block[T], Block[U]]`. The bug is causing various TypeError exceptions when trying to cast values from `'float64'` to `'int64'` in a safe manner.

The issue in the function appears to be related to the discrepancy between defined dtypes for numeric values in the functioning script and the assumptions made in the `_cython_agg_blocks`. The assumed_cast method applied during casting may not be symmetrical to the actual casting when dealing with 'int64' and 'float64' types.

To fix this bug, the explicit dtype cast should be used instead. The aim is to infer whether the dtype to which the values are being cast is an equivalent integral type by using a conditional checking, and if so, the casting should be conducted using `values.astype(int)` rather than `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe")`. 

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to resolve this bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... previous implementation...

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # box the values for the time being
            result, _ = _algos.dispatch_to_extension_array(
                block.values, how, numeric_only
            )
        
        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            target_dtype = block.dtype.to_numpy_dtype()
            casted_values = np.asarray(result, dtype=target_dtype)
            # check the inferred dtype
            correct_dtype = np.issubdtype(casted_values.dtype, np.integer)
            if correct_dtype:
                # if the values can indeed be cast to an equivalent integral type
                # cast it to 'int'
                block.set(converter.cast_scalar_to_type(casted_values, np.int_), locs)
                result = casted_values
            else:
                # otherwise, keep the result casted to the specified dtype
                block_values = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_listlike=True,
                                 convert_numeric=True, convert_bool=True)

                block_blk = make_block(block_values, block.items, ndim=1)
                new_items.append(block_blk.mgr_locs)
                agg_blocks.append(block_blk)
                continue
        else:
            # ... handle "ohlc" operation ...
    
    # ... code continued...
    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    # ... code continued...
```

By handling the cast explicitly based on inferred dtypes and conditional checking, this revised version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should rectify the bug and ensure that the TypeError exceptions don't arise while casting values from 'float64' to 'int64'. The revised function now effectively handles the dtype casting during aggregation. After this fix, the failing test cases should no longer throw type-casting-related exceptions.
