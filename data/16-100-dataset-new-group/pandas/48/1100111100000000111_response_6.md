### Analysis
The issue arises when calling the `mean` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with an `Int64` dtype column, resulting in a TypeError. The bug seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations.

### Identified Bug
The bug occurs in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, where there is incorrect handling and aggregation of nullable integer data type columns.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug is caused by an improper handling of the nullable integer data type within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, leading to the TypeError when performing aggregation operations such as `mean`. It seems that the code does not handle the nullable integer data type as expected.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
The bug can be fixed by adjusting how the nullable integer data type is handled within the `_cython_agg_blocks` method. Specifically, the code should properly handle the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations.

### Bug Fix
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method that addresses the bug:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Convert nullable integer data type to float for aggregation
    data = data.convert_dtypes()
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
``` 

In the bug fix, we've added the `convert_dtypes` method to convert nullable integer columns to a suitable dtype for aggregation, which should resolve the issue with TypeError during aggregation operations.
