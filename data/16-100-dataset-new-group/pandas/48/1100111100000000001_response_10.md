It looks like the _cython_agg_blocks function is trying to aggregate data using the grouper's aggregate method. However, there seem to be some potential error locations within this function. The first potential error location is in the try-except block where it catches NotImplementedError. It seems to be missing some error handling for this exception. Additionally, there are parts of the code that are difficult to follow and may lead to potential bugs.

To fix the bug, a suggested strategy would be to reorganize the code for better readability and to add appropriate error handling for the exception caught.

Here is a corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    aggregated_blocks = []
    aggregated_items = []
    
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError(
                    "The operation in an alternate way is not supported."
                )
            obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
        
        dtype = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(block.dtype)
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs, dtype=dtype)
        aggregated_blocks.append(agg_block)
    
    for block in aggregated_blocks:
        aggregated_items.extend(block.mgr_locs)

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.unique(aggregated_items))

    return aggregated_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the code has been simplified and the error handling for the NotImplementedError has been improved. Additionally, the usage of np.unique has been used to get unique aggregated items. This should help in resolving the potential issues in the original function.
