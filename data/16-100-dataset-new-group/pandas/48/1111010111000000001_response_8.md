The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is part of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. It takes several parameters, including `how`, `alt`, `numeric_only`, and `min_count`. The bug likely stems from the conditional statement `if numeric_only:` and the subsequent manipulations of data based on the condition.

The failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` aims to test aggregation functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object and compare the results with expected output. The expected output is generated based on the provided input data.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the handling of nullable integer types (`Int64`) within the function, especially with the conditional logic for `numeric_only`. A strategy for fixing the bug could involve revising the handling of numeric only blocks, and possibly handling cases related to nullable integer types more explicitly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    for label, group in self:
        aggregations = group.agg(how, min_count=min_count)
        new_items.append(label)
        agg_blocks.append(Block(agg=aggregations, values=None))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    new_items = np.array(new_items)
    agg_items = np.sort(new_items)

    indexer = np.searchsorted(new_items, agg_items, side="left")
    index_map = dict(zip(new_items, indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        blk.set_indexer(index_map)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function loops through the groups and applies the aggregation functions, keeping track of new items. It then constructs the aggregate blocks and returns them.

This corrected version should address the issues with handling nullable integer types and the conditional logic for `numeric_only`, which should result in passing the failing test.
