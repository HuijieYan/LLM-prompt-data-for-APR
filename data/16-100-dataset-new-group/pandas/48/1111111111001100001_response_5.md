The issue with the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is that it is returning the wrong result, which is causing the failing tests. The expected result is not being computed correctly for the provided input. The function is failing to compute the mean, median, and variance for the groups defined by the input DataFrame.

The main problems in the function are related to the computation of aggregate block values and the grouping of data within block managers. To improve the function, we need to correct the aggregation process and ensure that the mean, median, and variance are correctly computed for the groups.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=0, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

To validate this corrected version, the function should be tested using the failing test cases provided. If the corrected function passes all the tests, then the bug has been fixed.

Let's run these tests to ensure that the corrected function works as expected.
