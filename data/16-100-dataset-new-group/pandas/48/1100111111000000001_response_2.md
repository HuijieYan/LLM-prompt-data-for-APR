The cause of the bug in the provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` is due to the mishandling of nullable integer data types. The function fails to properly perform aggregation operations on columns with nullable integers, resulting in incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types properly while performing aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs should happen via BlockManager.combine
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()
    
    result_mgr = data._agg_by_level(
        how=how, alt=alt, numeric_only=numeric_only, min_count=min_count
    )
    return result_mgr.blocks, result_mgr.items
```

By using the `convert_dtypes` method on the `data` block manager, we can ensure that the nullable integer data types are handled properly during aggregation operations.

This corrected version of the function should now pass the failing test cases.
