## Analysis
The bug seems to be related to an issue with safely casting non-equivalent `float64` to `int64` when using the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy object with Int64 dtype.

The bug raises a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on the DataFrameGroupBy object.

The error message is raised from the `safe_cast` function in the `pandas/core/arrays/integer.py` file, which seems to be related to attempting to cast a float64 array to an int64 array.

## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by attempting to safely cast non-equivalent float64 values to int64, which is likely a result of incorrect or insufficient handling of the data type conversions within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This can lead to conflicts when attempting to perform aggregation operations on the data. 

The issue is also highlighted in the GitHub issue, indicating that there is a problem when using nullable integer data types with certain aggregation functions.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that the aggregation operations work correctly with nullable integer data types. It may involve adjusting the way data type conversions are handled within the function and addressing any conflicts related to non-equivalent float64 to int64 casting.

Additionally, it may be necessary to account for nullable Integer data types when performing the aggregation operation in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

## Bug Fix
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    for block in data.blocks:
        # ... (existing code)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_datetime=False, convert_timedelta=False)

            if (
                isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype)
                and np.issubdtype(result.dtype, np.floating)
                and block.maybe_upcast(result).dtype != result.dtype
            ):
                # Ensure the result has a nullable integer dtype
                result = maybe_convert_objects(
                    result, convert_datetime=False, convert_timedelta=False
                )
            elif result.dtype != block.dtype:
                # Cast the result back to the original dtype
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            # Add code to handle nullable integer data types
            if isinstance(block.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(values=result, dtype=block.dtype, copy=False)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            
            # ... (existing code)
```
In the fixed version, we have added a conditional check for handling nullable integer data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. If the block has a nullable integer dtype, we perform additional operations to ensure the correct casting and conversion of the result to the original dtype. Additionally, we have modified the way the `result` is processed and cast to handle the specific case of nullable integer data types. This should help avoid the TypeError related to non-equivalent float64 to int64 casting when using certain aggregation functions on DataFrameGroupBy objects with Int64 dtype.
