## Solution

### Bug Analysis
The bug seems to be related to calling mean, median, and std on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The issue provides sample code and expected output, which can be used to debug and fix this bug.

### Bug Identification
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the groupby operations and aggregation. The issue mentioned that the error occurs when calling `mean` and other aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, which matches the context of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Cause of the Bug
The issue occurs when passing a DataFrame with the Int64 dtype to the `mean` method after grouping. The `_cython_agg_blocks` function is responsible for performing aggregation operations, and it appears there is an issue with handling the Int64 dtype when performing these operations.

### Bug Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to handle the aggregation of Int64 dtype correctly in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

### Updated `_cython_agg_blocks` Function
Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    # Rest of the variables have been omitted for brevity

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if isinstance(block.values, pd.IntegerArray):
                result = maybe_convert_objects(block.values)
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    result, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the exception if needed

        # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The key change in the updated function is to handle the case where the block values have the Int64 dtype. We convert the Int64 values to objects using `maybe_convert_objects` before performing the aggregation, which should resolve the TypeError issue when calling `mean` and other aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype.

By making this change, the function should be able to handle the Int64 dtype correctly for aggregation operations.

This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
