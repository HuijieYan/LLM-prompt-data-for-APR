### Analysis
The issue seems to be related to calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, resulting in a TypeError. The bug occurs with other functions like median and std as well. The issue seems to be related to the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.

### Potential Error Locations
1. Handling of the `how` parameter in the function.
2. Error handling for unsupported operations causing a `NotImplementedError`.
3. Aggregating the result and casting the block back to the original dtype.

### Cause of the Bug
The `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be handling aggregation operations, including computing the mean, median, etc. There are scenarios when the function fails to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`), resulting in a TypeError.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
1. Check for specific type handling related to `Int64` in the function.
2. Update the function to support the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) for aggregation operations.
3. Enhance error handling to avoid TypeError when operating on `Int64` data type.

### Corrected Version
```python
from pandas.core.internals import ExtensionBlock, make_block

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing implementation...

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing implementation...

        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        # Enhance handling for Int64 type
        if isinstance(block, ExtensionBlock) and block.is_integer:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_integer=True)

        # Existing implementation...

    # Existing implementation...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we have added additional handling to `result` when dealing with the `Int64` data type. It includes converting the result to native Python integers when needed and enhances the compatibility with the `Int64` dtype.

This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide support for `mean`, `median`, and other aggregation operations when dealing with nullable integer data type (`Int64`).
