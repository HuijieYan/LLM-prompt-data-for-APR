The bug in the given function can be identified in the exception handling block that follows `try` clause in the following code snippets:
```python
except NotImplementedError:
  # generally if we have numeric_only=False
  # and non-applicable functions
  # try to python agg

  if alt is None:
      # we cannot perform the operation
      # in an alternate way, exclude the block
      assert how == "ohlc"
      deleted_items.append(locs)
      continue
```
The `try` clause within the `except` block tries to execute a different operation if `NotImplementedError` is raised. However, if that operation fails as well or returns a result other than DataFrame, the code does not handle it. This behavior can cause unexpected values stored in `agg_blocks`, `new_items`, and `agg_items`, leading to the DataError raised at the end of the function. 

To address this issue, we should include additional handling in the `except` block to address the situation when the alternative operation fails for a given block. Furthermore, the condition inside the if statement is misplaced and needs reevaluation to also consider alternate ways for operations other than 'ohlc'.

Here's a corrected version of the bug-fixed function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, DataError):
            # Attempt to perform the operation in an alternate way
            if alt is None:
                # No alternate operation possible, exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # Exception in trying to aggregate, continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result._data.blocks[0].values

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
      # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

```
In the corrected function:
1. We wrap the exception handling in the `try` clause to catch both NotImplementedError and DataError, the `except` block is modified accordingly.
2. A subsequent check is added to determine whether the result is an instance of DataFrame and handle it accordingly.
3. The clarity in the code is improved for future readers and maintainability.

This updated function should now accurately handle different operations for each block and return the expected result without raising DataError.
