The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks()` in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class, located in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. The function is producing a TypeError when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

The cause of the bug is that when calling certain aggregation functions (`mean`, `median`, `var`) on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, it results in a TypeError due to the handling of nullable integers.

To fix this bug, you will need to modify the code in the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function to properly handle the aggregation of nullable integers.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class DataFrameGroupBy:
    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # ... (other parts of the function)
        
        if numeric_only:
            # Replace the line below with the one following it
            # data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
            data = data.select_dtypes(include=[np.number], exclude=[pd.Int64Dtype], copy=False)

        # ... (other parts of the function)
```

In the corrected version of the function, we're replacing the `get_numeric_data` method with `select_dtypes`, which allows us to exclude nullable integer dtype when retrieving the numeric data. This should handle the aggregation of nullable integers without causing the TypeError.

After making this change, the function should pass the failing tests and resolve the GitHub issue related to calling aggregation functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype.
