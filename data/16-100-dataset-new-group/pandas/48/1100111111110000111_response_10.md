The issue is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic` module. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

This bug is occurring when a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype has `mean`, `median`, or `var` called on it. The issue was reported on GitHub with the title "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError".

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is attempting to convert the result of the operation to the dtype of the input, and it is not handling the nullable integer type as expected.

In order to fix this bug, we need to handle how the function `_cython_agg_blocks` converts between float64 and int64 for the nullable integer type. We should ensure that the dtype conversion for nullable integer types is handled correctly when statistical operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` are performed.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    # Existing code
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code
        
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

            # Additional code to handle dtype for nullable integer type
            if block.dtype.name == 'Int64':
                result = result.fillna(np.nan).astype('float64')
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Existing code
            
    # Existing code
```

By adding this additional check and conversion for the nullable integer type, we can ensure that the result of the operation is correctly handled and the TypeError is resolved.

This fix will address the issue reported on GitHub and allow the `mean`, `median`, and `var` operations to work correctly with nullable integer types. After applying this fix, the error in the failing test should be resolved.
