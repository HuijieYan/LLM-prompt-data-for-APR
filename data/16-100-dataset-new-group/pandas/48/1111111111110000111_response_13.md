Based on the error messages and the GitHub issue provided, it seems that the bug is caused by the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This function is encountering a type error (`TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64')`).

The issue on GitHub mentions a problem with calling `mean()` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, which results in a `TypeError`. The expected output is a DataFrame with the mean values for each group, but calling `mean()` results in a type error.

### Bug Fix Strategy:
The bug fix strategy involves editing the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the casting of values from `float64` to `int64` correctly. A possible solution is to explicitly check the data type of the input and output, and if the input data type is `int64`, convert the output to `int64` as well.

### Updated `_cython_agg_blocks` Function:
Here's an updated and corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ignore the previous implementation

    # remaining code...

    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # previous code...

        # existing code...

        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True, convert_string=False)

        # convert result to proper dtype -- new code
        if result.dtype == np.float64 and block.dtype == np.int64:
            result = result.astype(np.int64)

        # remaining code...

    # return statement...
```

In this version of the function, we added a conditional check to convert the result to `int64` if the original data is of `int64` type.

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle the casting of values from `float64` to `int64` when computing the aggregation, resolving the type error issue encountered in the tests.

Please integrate the corrected `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the appropriate file and test it with the failing test cases to ensure that the bug is fixed.
