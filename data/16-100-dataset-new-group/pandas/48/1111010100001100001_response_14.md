The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is experiencing issues when handling the `how` parameter, specifically when the value is not supported or when it is attempting to perform a variance calculation. 

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that there are a few potential issues within the `try-except` blocks. It appears that the function is not handling the case of variance calculation properly, which leads to the incorrect result being returned.

The cause of the bug is that the exception handling for unsupported aggregation methods and variance calculation is not properly implemented. The `how` parameter values such as 'var' or unsupported method such as 'median' are not being handled correctly and could result in unexpected behavior and outputs.

To fix the bug, the exception handling for unsupported aggregation methods and variance calculation needs to be revised and properly implemented. Additionally, it might be necessary to add conditions to handle unsupported `how` parameter values.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for idx, block in enumerate(data.blocks):
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (NotImplementedError, TypeError) as e:
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[idx]]
            # Process 'var' separately
            if how == 'var':
                result = obj.var(axis=self.axis, skipna=True)
            else:
                result = obj.agg(alt, axis=self.axis)

        # Handle multiple block output
        if hasattr(result, '_data') and len(result._data.blocks) > 1:
            split_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            split_frames.append(result)

        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we handle the 'var' separately from general aggregation methods, and we also handle the case where unsupported methods are provided. Additionally, in the case of split blocks, we ensure that they are properly handled.
