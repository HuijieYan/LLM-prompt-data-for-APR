The root cause of the bug is that calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype results in a `TypeError`. This issue is caused by a problem in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The issue seems to arise from the way the function interacts with nullable integer data types when processing group-by operations, leading to unexpected `TypeError` outcomes. The affected operations include functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

To resolve the issue, a suitable strategy would be to modify the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types and achieve the expected outcomes without raising a `TypeError`. The modifications may include handling nullable integers separately or converting the data to a suitable format before aggregation.

Given the analysis, a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count, alt=alt
        )
        
        # Handle nullable integer data separately
        if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and block.dtype.kind == 'i':
            result = result.astype('float64', casting='safe')
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Combine the aggregated blocks and return the results
    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

In this corrected version, the aggregation process is adjusted to handle nullable integer data separately, converting it to the appropriate format to ensure the correct outcomes without raising a `TypeError`.

This adjusted function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub description.
