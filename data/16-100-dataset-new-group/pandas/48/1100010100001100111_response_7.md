Based on the provided information and the GitHub issue, the bug seems to be related to calling the `mean` function after grouping a DataFrame with `Int64` dtype. The error occurs when calling functions such as `mean`, `median`, and `std` after grouping.

From the runtime values and types of variables, the presence of `TypeError` suggests that the bug might be related to the data type handling within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The input DataFrame has `Int64` dtype, and the buggy function is trying to perform numeric operations on it.

A strategy for fixing the bug would be to handle the `Int64` data type explicitly and ensure that the calculations for `mean`, `median`, and other statistical operations are compatible with this data type.

Below is the corrected version of the function based on the provided information and the GitHub issue.

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            values = block.values
            if isinstance(values, pd.Int64Dtype):
                result = values.to_numpy(dtype=float).mean()
            else:
                result = values.mean()
        except NotImplementedError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(np.array([result]))

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `Int64` dtype is explicitly handled by converting the values to a numpy array with type `float` before applying the `mean` function.
2. The error handling for `NotImplementedError` and the subsequent block exclusion is retained as in the original function.

This version aims to address the bug described in the GitHub issue by appropriately handling the `Int64` dtype during the aggregation operation.
