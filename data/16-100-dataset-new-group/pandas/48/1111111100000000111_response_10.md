The bug seems to be related to the way the `DataFrameGroupBy` class computes the mean when the column has the `Int64` dtype. It also occurs with other aggregation functions like `median` and `std`. With the information provided in the GitHub issue, the bug causes a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with a column of `Int64` dtype.

The cause of the bug appears to be related to the differentiation between the `Int64` dtype and the `int64` dtype, which leads to an incorrect data conversion resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the `Int64` dtype when performing aggregations. This may involve explicitly checking for the `Int64` dtype within the function and applying the appropriate conversion logic when necessary.

A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the code within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to first check for the `Int64` dtype and handle it appropriately when performing aggregations. This may include casting the data to a suitable type for aggregation operations to ensure compatibility.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for col_loc, block in data.iteritems():
        if block.dtype.name != 'Int64':
            # continue with the aggregation as usual for non-Int64 dtypes
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            # handle the Int64 dtype differently
            result = block.values.astype('float64').mean(axis=1).values

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(col_loc)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we explicitly handle the `Int64` dtype by converting it to `float64` when computing the mean, ensuring compatibility and addressing the original bug described in the GitHub issue.
