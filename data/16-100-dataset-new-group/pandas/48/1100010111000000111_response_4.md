The bug occurs in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function fails the test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` in the file `pandas/tests/groupby/test_function.py`. The GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError" provides a detailed description of the problem and the expected output.

The bug seems to be related to the grouping of nullable integer data type and then applying operations like mean, median, or var. These operations result in a TypeError, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be adjusted to handle nullable integer data type columns properly when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and var on grouped data.

The corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not np.nan:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With this fix, the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should now handle nullable integer data type columns properly when performing aggregation operations, and it should pass the failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float`.

By updating the error handling and type conversion processes within the function, the bug can be resolved. It's important to handle nullable integer data types correctly during the aggregation process.

Please note that the corrected function provided here is a partial fix, and it may need further adjustments based on the specific requirements and considerations of the `pandas` library. Additionally, this fix may need to be further reviewed and tested within the `pandas` library before being officially implemented.
