After examining the provided function and the failing test, it appears that the bug is related to incorrect casting of values from `float64` to `int64`. The issue originates from the details of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function and the way it handles the casting of float64 values to int64. 

The specific error message in each of the failed tests is related to TypeError encountered when trying to cast float64 to int64 using 'safe' casting rule.

The logical bug fix for this issue would be to handle the casting of float64 to int64 in a way that is consistent with the safe casting rule. This may involve handling the conversion appropriately to avoid the TypeError that is currently being encountered.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should resolve the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Other parts of the function remain as they are
    # ...

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Parts of the existing loop and exception handling
        # ...

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.dtype == np.float64:
                # Handle the casting of float64 values to int64 appropriately
                result = result.astype(np.int64, casting="safe")
    
            # Other parts of the function remain as they are
            # ...

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

The main change in the corrected version includes the addition of a conditional block to handle the specific scenario where the result is a float64 array, and in that case, it correctly casts the values to int64 using the safe casting rule. This should resolve the TypeError encountered with the previous version of the function.
