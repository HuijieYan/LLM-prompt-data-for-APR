The provided buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks()` within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the file `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py`. The function is intended to perform aggregation on the groups within a DataFrameGroupBy object. The issue is related to calling the `mean` method on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype, which results in a `TypeError`.

Upon analyzing the function, the potential error locations are:
1. The handling of `object-dtype blocks` might be causing inconsistencies in the data processing.
2. The aggregation process for `Int64` dtype might not be properly handled based on the given GitHub issue description.

The cause of the bug is due to the inconsistent handling of the `Int64` dtype during aggregation, which results in a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` method on a DataFrameGroupBy object.

To fix the bug, a strategy would be to review the data processing steps, specifically for `Int64` dtype, and ensure that the aggregation process for this data type is handled properly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks()` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    data = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include='number', copy=False)
        
    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected version, the `.get_numeric_data(copy=False)` method has been replaced with `select_dtypes(include='number', copy=False)` to specifically select numeric data types, which should include the `Int64` dtype as well.

This change ensures that the aggregation process handles the `Int64` dtype properly and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post. After making this change, the failing test case should pass, and the bug related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with `Int64` dtype should be fixed.
