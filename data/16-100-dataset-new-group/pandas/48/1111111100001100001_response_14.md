The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be that it's assuming a 2D array as the result, but in some cases, the result is a 1D array. This leads to shape inconsistencies and potential errors.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the dimensionality of the result properly. This might involve reshaping the array to ensure it is consistent with the expectations of the calling code.

Here is the corrected version of the function that includes reshaping the result to ensure a consistent shape:

```python
# Other imports
# ...

class DataFrameGroupBy(GroupBy):
    # ...

    def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # ... (previous code)

        for block in data.blocks:
            # ... (previous code)

            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            # Reshape the result to ensure consistent shape
            if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            # ... (rest of the code)

        # ... (rest of the code)

        return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
In this corrected version, after obtaining the result from aggregation, if the result is determined to be a 1D array, it is reshaped to become a 2D array, ensuring consistency across different cases.
