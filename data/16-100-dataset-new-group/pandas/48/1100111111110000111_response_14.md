This bug is causing a TypeError when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer (`Int64`) data type. The error occurs when casting a float to an integer, which is not allowed. This issue has been posted on the GitHub platform and titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

The cause of the bug is a data type casting issue. The `safe_cast` function is trying to cast a float value to an integer (from `float64` to `int64`) according to the "safe" rule, which is not permissible. This is causing the TypeError when the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions are called on the `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` data type.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly when performing aggregation operations. The bug is likely related to the way the aggregation operations are handling the nullable integer data type, causing an incorrect data type conversion. Instead, the code needs to ensure that the nullable integer data type is handled properly during aggregation, avoiding unnecessary conversions from float to integer when not applicable.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (code that was not causing the error)

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()  # Use convert_dtypes to ensure proper type conversions
    
    # ... (rest of the function)
``` 

In the corrected version, the `convert_dtypes` method is used to ensure proper type conversion for nullable integer data type (`Int64`) when performing aggregation. This should avoid the unnecessary float to integer conversion and resolve the TypeError issue.

This fix is targeted at handling the nullable integer data type in a way that prevents incorrect type conversions, thus allowing the aggregation functions to work properly on `DataFrameGroupBy` objects with `Int64` data type.
