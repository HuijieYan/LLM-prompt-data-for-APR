The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the calculation of aggregate statistics on a DataFrameGroupBy object. It causes a TypeError when calling mean, median, or std after grouping and is associated with the new nullable integer data type (Int64). The issue is outlined in the GitHub description.

To address the bug, the _cython_agg_blocks function should be modified to handle the nullable integer data type correctly and prevent the TypeError from occurring. Specifically, the error relates to handling the nullable integer data type in the DataFrameGroupBy.mean, DataFrameGroupBy.median, and DataFrameGroupBy.std functions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block, how, axis=1
            )
        except DataError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No types to aggregate")

    # Update the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Reset mgr_locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = BlockPlacement(indexer[offset : (offset + loc)])
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This modified function should handle the nullable integer data type correctly when performing aggregations, preventing the TypeError that was occurring.

This fix should address the issue reported on GitHub where calling mean, median, or std after grouping results in a TypeError.
