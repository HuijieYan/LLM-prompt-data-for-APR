The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the aggregation of data based on certain criteria, such as how the aggregation should be performed and which blocks of data should be included or excluded. The function is intended to perform aggregation on DataFrameGroupBy objects, and it seems to be relevant to the "GroupBy" logic.

The potential error locations in the function are primarily in the handling of various blocks and exceptions related to aggregation. The complex logic for handling different types of blocks, splitting and concatenating items, and the conditional treatment of results could lead to potential issues.

The cause of the bug might be that the function does not handle all possible variations of aggregation correctly and might not generate the expected aggregated result under certain conditions.

A strategy for fixing the bug could involve a review and refactoring of the complexity within the function. Moreover, a systematic error-handling mechanism, clearer logic for data handling, and a more consistent approach for aggregation could contribute to a bug-free function. Additionally, thorough testing with different kinds of input data and aggregation types might be required to ensure the correctness of the fix.

Here's the corrected version of the function with potential improvements:
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except (...):
            # Handle specific exceptions and non-applicable functions
            
            if alt is None:
                # Exclude the block if the operation cannot be performed in an alternate way
                assert how == "ohlc"
                continue

            # Call alternate aggregation method
            result_df = apply_alternate_aggregation_method(block, alt)
            if result_df is not None:
                # process the result and add to the aggregated blocks
                agg_block = process_result_as_block(result_df)
                agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

    # Construct the aggregated items and blocks
    agg_items, agg_blocks = construct_aggregated_items_blocks(new_items, split_frames, agg_blocks)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

Please note that the actual implementation will require a more in-depth understanding of the entire DataFrameGroupBy class and its interactions, as well as the availability of specific error handling and alternate aggregation methods. The provided code is a simplified example to demonstrate potential improvements in the function.
