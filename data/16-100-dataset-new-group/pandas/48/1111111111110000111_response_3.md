From the error messages and the GitHub issue, it is observed that there is a problem with converting `float64` to `int64` when calling the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on a grouped DataFrame containing nullable integers.

The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely causing this issue, specifically the part that handles block values and attempts to cast them back to the original dtype.

To fix this issue, it is important to ensure that when performing operations like `mean`, `median`, and `var` on grouped nullable integer data, the dataframe values are correctly cast to float (if they are not already) for the calculation of these statistics.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.cast import maybe_downcast_to_dtype

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... other parts of the function

    # Get the dataframe to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # Apply numeric_only filter
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # ... other parts of the function

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        # ... other parts of the function
        if result is not no_result:
            if numeric_only:
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, np.float64)
            if block.dtype.name.startswith('Int'):
                result = result.astype('Int64')

            # ...

    # ... other parts of the function
```

In the corrected version, we apply the `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` function to ensure that the resulting block is of the appropriate dtype, especially when dealing with nullable integers.

Please consider integrating this correction into the applicable codebase to address the issue.
