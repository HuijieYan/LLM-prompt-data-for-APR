The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is causing a `TypeError` when trying to cast non-equivalent data types. This bug is highlighted in the GitHub issue "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError", where calling `mean` after grouping a DataFrame with Int64 dtype results in a `TypeError`.

The cause of the bug is that the function attempts to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64 using the `astype` method. This is not possible according to the rule 'safe', resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function should be used to safely cast the data to the specified data type if they are equivalent. This will handle the casting logic and avoid the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle the case where an operation is non-applicable
            # For example, when dealing with how='ohlc'
            if alt is None:
                deleted_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
                continue

            # Call the grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[block.mgr_locs.as_array]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            result = result.astype(block.dtype)
        else:
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
        
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```
By using the `maybe_downcast_numeric` function, we ensure that the values are safely cast to the dtype if they are equivalent, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring. After making this change, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
