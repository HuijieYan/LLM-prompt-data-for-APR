The root cause of the bug is that the `agg_blocks` list and the `agg_items` Index are not created properly due to incorrect handling of the grouping and aggregation of the data blocks. The issue lies in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the logic related to aggregation.

Based on the analysis of the runtime variable values and types, it is clear that there are inconsistencies in the `agg_blocks` list, `agg_items` Index, and other relevant variables such as `result`, `block.values`, and `block.is_extension`.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the `agg_blocks` list and the `agg_items` Index needs to be revised. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the data aggregation and grouping logic for internal consistency.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._try_coerce_result.copy()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:

        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = result.values

        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        new_items.append(locs)

    agg_items = data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, I've simplified the logic for iterating through the data blocks and aggregating the results. I've also used a new approach to create the `agg_blocks` list and the `agg_items` Index based on the correct values derived from the input parameters and the runtime variables. Additionally, I've avoided unnecessary assumptions about the result types to ensure consistency and proper handling of the results.

Please note that this correction assumes that the internal methods and methods like `aggregate`, `make_block`, and `take` function as intended. It's important to verify all aspects of the implementation based on the specific requirements and behavior of the pandas library.
