The bug occurs when trying to cast non-equivalent `float64` values to `int64` according to the rule 'safe', which results in a `TypeError`. The issue lies in how the datatype casting is being handled within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. The make_block method is used to process results, and some of the datatype conversions are explicitly attempted, which leads to the casting errors.

To fix the bug, a suggested strategy can be to ensure that the appropriate datatype conversions are handled correctly. We also need to be aware of the location of the error and the expected result. The aim is to ensure that the casting operation is safe and doesn't result in incompatible datatype conversions.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code ...

            # Skipping some code here for brevity ...

            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=False, convert_string=False)

            if result.dtype == "object":
                raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")
            
            # Existing code ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, a call to `maybe_convert_objects` is added to ensure proper conversion of the data types and to handle cases where an object datatype might not be numeric. The result is properly checked to avoid casting errors related to non-equivalent data types. This corrected version should address the casting issues and ensure the correct execution of the function. After applying this fix, the function should pass the failing test.
