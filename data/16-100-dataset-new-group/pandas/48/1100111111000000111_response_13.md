The bug in the given `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be related to the handling of nullable integer data types. It is shown to fail in the test due to a TypeError when calling the `mean` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype. This seems to be consistent with the GitHub issue titled "calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError."

Upon analyzing the function, the bug seems to stem from the handling of nullable integer data types when performing aggregation operations like mean, median, and var. The way the function interacts with the groupby function and how it computes the results seems to be the root cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, updating the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types appropriately would be essential to pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

The key change in the corrected version is to use the `convert_dtypes` method to handle nullable integer data types appropriately. This method converts the columns relevant to nullable integers to the `Int64Dtype` during the aggregation process, ensuring operations like `mean` work correctly.

By making this change in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it should resolve the bug, pass the failing test, and address the issues reported on the GitHub page.
