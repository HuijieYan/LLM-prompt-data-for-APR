The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely related to the computation of the mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype (Int64). The reported GitHub issue also highlights the error in calling mean after grouping which results in a TypeError.

The bug might be caused by the difference in behavior when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype compared to int64 dtype. 

A potential strategy for fixing the bug is to handle the computations differently based on the dtype being used. If the input dtype is Int64, then the function should handle the calculation of mean and other aggregation functions accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the function that includes handling the calculation of mean based on the dtype:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        # ... (other code remains the same)

        # Handle nullable integer dtype (Int64) differently
        if is_integer_dtype(block.dtype) and is_integer_array_dtype(block.values):
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, 'sum', axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            result /= self.grouper.aggregate(
                np.isnan(block.values), 'sum', axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )

        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

In this corrected version, I added a conditional check for the nullable integer dtype (Int64) and handled the computation of mean accordingly, by dividing the summation with the count of non-null values.

This adjustment should resolve the issue of calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.
