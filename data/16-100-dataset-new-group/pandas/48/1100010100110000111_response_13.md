## Analysis
- The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to casting array from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'.
- The error is occurring when calling the `mean`, `median`, or `var` functions on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype.
- The issue in the GitHub report also confirms the problem and provides the expected output for the `mean` function.
- The error occurs while trying to cast the floating-point values to integer type under the `safe_cast` function.

## Bug Cause
The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function causes the issue. When attempting to perform an aggregation of specific data types, the internal type conversion is encountering problems, leading to the `TypeError` due to the mismatch of data types.

## Suggested Fix Strategy
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the type casting of the values adheres to the type conversion rules and safely handles the conversion of float64 to int64. This may require checking the data types before casting and handling nullable integers appropriately.

## Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)  # Use convert method instead of get_numeric_data

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if not self.grouper.is_numeric:
            # Handle non-numeric data separately
            result = self.aggregate_non_numeric(block, how, alt, min_count)
        else:
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is None:
            continue

        agg_block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for i, blk in enumerate(agg_blocks):
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer
        agg_blocks[i] = blk

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The corrected version addresses the bug by:
1. Using the `convert` method to handle the conversion of non-numeric data and ensure data type compatibility.
2. Properly handling the aggregation based on the numeric nature of the data.
3. Resetting the locs in the blocks according to the current ordering.
4. Returning the updated `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` to resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.

This corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function should pass the failing test and resolve the reported issue.
