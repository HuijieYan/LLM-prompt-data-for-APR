The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has the potential to cause an issue due to the handling of the `Block` objects and the `result` variable. The bug appears to be related to the handling of nullable integer types in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class.

The cause of the bug is that the function `_cython_agg_blocks` fails to handle nullable integer types when aggregating. This results in a TypeError when calling mean, median, or std after grouping when the data type is 'Int64'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to properly handle nullable integer types when performing aggregation operations.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
            block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
        )

        if result is not None and not np.isnan(result) and not np.isinf(result):
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)

            try:
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
            except DataError:
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, try_float=True)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs)

            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_items = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = agg_items[~np.isnan(agg_items)]

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should handle nullable integer types and prevent the TypeError when using mean, median, or std after grouping.
