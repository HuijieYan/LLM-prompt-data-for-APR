The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function seems to be caused by incorrect logic for the calculation of aggregate blocks. The function should correctly handle the aggregation based on the input parameters and the `self.obj` DataFrame to generate the aggregate blocks. The calculated aggregate blocks should be consistent with the expected result of the aggregation operation.

The input parameters passed to the function are `numeric_only`, `how`, `min_count`, `self.obj`, and `self.axis`. The `_get_data_to_aggregate` method fetches the required data for aggregation.

The key information about the DataFrame `self.obj` that is used for the failing test is:
```python
self.obj = pd.DataFrame({
    "a": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
    "b": [1, pd.NA, 2, 1, pd.NA, 2, 1, pd.NA, 2],
}, dtype="Int64").groupby("a")
```

Analysis of the runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function reveals that the calculated `agg_blocks` seems to be incorrect. The dtype of the calculations on the `self.obj` DataFrame also seems to be inconsistent with what is expected.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the `agg_blocks` should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it returns the correct values based on the aggregation operation specified by the input parameters.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if block.ndim > 1:
            # Perform aggregation differently for multi-dimensional blocks
            result_blocks = []

            for i in range(block.shape[1]):
                col_block = block._iget_column(i)
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    col_block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
                )
                result_blocks.append(block.make_block(result, fastpath=True))

            if len(result_blocks) == 1:
                agg_blocks.append(result_blocks[0])
            else:
                # Reconstruct a multi-dimensional block from the list of resulted blocks
                new_block = make_block(result_blocks, placement=col_block.mgr_locs)
                agg_blocks.append(new_block)
        else:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block = block.make_block(result, fastpath=True)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the correct aggregation operation is applied based on the input parameters and the structure of the data to be aggregated. It handles multi-dimensional blocks differently by aggregating and reconstructing the blocks as necessary.

With this corrected implementation, the function should now produce the correct `agg_blocks` and pass the failing test cases.
