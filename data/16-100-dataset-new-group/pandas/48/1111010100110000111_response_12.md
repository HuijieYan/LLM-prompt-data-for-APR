### Bug Analysis
#### The buggy function and its relationship with the buggy class:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class which is a subclass of the `GroupBy` class in the pandas library.

#### Identified potential error locations:
The error is likely to be caused by the cast operation within the `safe_cast` function, which tries to convert float values to int64, resulting in a `TypeError`.

#### Cause of the bug:
The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect handling of nullable integer types (Int64) during aggregation operations like `mean`, `median`, or `var`. This results in a TypeError when trying to cast float values to int64.

#### Suggested strategy for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the behavior of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method to handle nullable integer types appropriately during aggregation operations and perform the necessary type casting without causing a TypeError.

### Bug Fix
Based on the error messages and analysis, here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[int] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)
        new_items = block.mgr_locs.take(result.indexer)
        agg_blocks.append(result.block)
        agg_items.extend(new_items)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, agg_items

def _aggregate_block(
    self, block: Block, how: str, alt=None, min_count: int = -1
) -> Union[DataFrame, Series]:
    if is_object_dtype(block.dtype):
        raise DataError("Casting from object dtype is not supported")

    result, new_items = super()._aggregate_block(block, how, alt, min_count)

    if block.isnull().any():  # check if block contains any missing values
        result = result.reindex_like(block, fill_value=pd.NA)  # convert to nullable dtype

    return result, new_items
```

In the fixed `_cython_agg_blocks` method, we handle the aggregation of each block individually and use the `_aggregate_block` method to compute the aggregation result. We also handle missing values and casting to nullable types as necessary.

### Summary
The bug was related to the incorrect handling of nullable integer types during aggregation operations in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. The fix involves modifying the aggregation logic and appropriate handling of nullable integer types to avoid the TypeError.
