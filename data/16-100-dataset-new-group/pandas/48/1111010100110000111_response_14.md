The bug in the function `_cython_agg_blocks` is causing a `TypeError` related to casting arrays from `float64` to `int64` according to the rule 'safe'. The issue reported on GitHub also describes the same error when calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype.

The cause of the bug is that the function tries to cast an array from `float64` to `int64` using the `astype` method in the `safe_cast` function. This results in the error due to the non-equivalence between `float64` and `int64` arrays.

To fix the bug, we should handle the special case when dealing with integer type arrays while considering nullable integers.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[int] = []
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            if block.dtype == "Int64":
                # Handle the special case for nullable integer arrays
                result = self.grouper.aggregate_int(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
            else:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-applicable functions
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        # ... (other parts of the function)

    # ... (other parts of the function)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, we introduced a check for the special case of nullable integer arrays and handle them differently in the `aggregate_int` method within the `self.grouper` object, which should be defined based on the use case. This special case handling ensures that the casting error from `float64` to `int64` is prevented.
