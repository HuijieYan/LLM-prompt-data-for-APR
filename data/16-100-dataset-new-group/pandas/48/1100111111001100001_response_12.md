The buggy function is encountering issues due to incorrect division of a single block into multiple blocks. This is causing an incorrect computation of aggregation, resulting in a failure for the tests.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the blocks are not split into multiple blocks during the aggregation process.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    
    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                raise NotImplementedError("Only numeric aggregation is currently supported")
                
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            
        if result is not no_result:
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)
            result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, dtype=block.dtype)
            agg_block: Block = make_block(result, placement=block.mgr_locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    agg_data = BlockManager(agg_blocks, data.axes)
    return agg_data, agg_data.items
```

The correction involves removing the split block logic, handling the result directly, and ensuring it is of the correct type.

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing tests.
