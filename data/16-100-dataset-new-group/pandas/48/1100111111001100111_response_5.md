## Bug Explanation

The bug seems to occur when the `mean` function is called on a DataFrameGroupBy object with `Int64` dtype. The bug results in a TypeError. The issue is related to the nullable integer data type, as the operations work with 'int64' dtype but fail when using 'Int64' dtype.

## Bug Fix Strategy

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type correctly. We will need to check the implementation of this function and the related classes and functions to ensure that the appropriate operations are applied to the nullable integer data type.

## The Corrected Version

```python
# The corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    result_frame = data._mgr.apply('group', grouper=self.grouper, axis=self.axis, how=how, alt=alt, numeric_only=numeric_only)

    return result_frame._data.blocks, result_frame.index
```

In the corrected version, we are using the `apply` method on the `BlockManager` to apply the grouping operation with the specified `how` function. This method should correctly handle the nullable integer data type and avoid the TypeError that was occurring in the original implementation.

This fix should address the bug reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the `mean` and other similar operations work as expected with the nullable integer data type.
