The bug seems to be related to the use of nullable integer data type while calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object. It results in a TypeError when using this data type, but it works with the `int64` dtype.

### Potential Error Locations within the Buggy Function
The error could be occurring within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function when handling the nullable integer data type.

### Cause of the Bug
The bug seems to be originating from the handling of nullable integer data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It might not be correctly handling the nullable integer data type when performing aggregation operations.

### Strategy for Fixing the Bug
A potential strategy for fixing the bug would involve modifying the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle the nullable integer data type correctly while performing aggregation operations. It could involve implementing a specific check for the nullable integer data type and applying the aggregation functions accordingly.

### Corrected Version of the Buggy Function
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    # Additional check for nullable integer data type
    if data._data.isna_dtype: 
        data = maybe_convert_objects(data, convert_numeric=True)
        
    for block in data.blocks:
        result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how=how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        item = block.item
        block = data.blocks[item]
        
        # Rest of the original implementation

    # Rest of the original implementation
```

This corrected version of the function introduces an additional check for nullable integer data type and uses the `maybe_convert_objects` function to handle the nullable integer data type appropriately while performing aggregation operations within the `DataFrameGroupBy`.
Note: The `maybe_convert_objects` function is used to handle nullable integer data type specifically in pandas.
