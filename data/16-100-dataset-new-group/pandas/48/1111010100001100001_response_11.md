The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function appears to stem from an improper arrangement of manipulating the `Block` and `BlockManager` objects, leading to mismatched shapes in the data and results array. The function is designed to calculate aggregates in specific blocks of the data, but handling of extensions, splitting into multiple blocks, and reindexing the data seem to be causing the inconsistency.

A potential strategy to fix the bug is to ensure that the aggregation is properly handled for each block, taking into consideration any potential splitting and reindexing. Handling of `ExtensionBlock` and potential split into different frames should be revised to align the data and results correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    locs_to_delete: List[int] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                locs_to_delete.extend(locs)
            else:
                obj = self.obj.loc[:, data.items[locs]]
                result = obj.apply(alt, axis=self.axis)
                agg_block = data.put(key=locs, value=result)._split_op_result(locs)
                if agg_block._data.blocks:
                    # Data split into different frames
                    raise NotImplementedError("Data is split into different frames.")
        new_items.extend(locs_to_delete)

        
    # Handle split blocks and cleanup
    if locs_to_delete:
        data = data.delete(items=locs_to_delete, axis=0)

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset:offset + loc]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised version aims to ensure proper aggregation handling for each block, and handles potential data splitting and reindexing properly. It also addresses potential scenarios such as data being split into different frames.

It's important to note that without access to the complete codebase, these changes might need further adjustments or integration into the surrounding code for full functionality.
