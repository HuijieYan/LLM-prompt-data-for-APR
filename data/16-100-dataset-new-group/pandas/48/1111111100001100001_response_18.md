The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` has several issues. The main problem is related to the manipulation of the DataFrame and BlockManager objects. Let's break down the problems identified:

1. The `data` object is initialized from the `_get_data_to_aggregate` method, but it's later overwritten by calling `data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)`. This might lead to unexpected behavior since the original `data` object is lost.

2. The variables `agg_blocks`, `new_items`, `deleted_items`, `split_items`, and `split_frames` are lists that seem to accumulate partial results for each block in the data. However, it's unclear how these results are being used or aggregated, leading to potential inconsistencies.

3. The DataFrame blocks processing logic inside the for-loop is complex and prone to issues. It's hard to trace which block corresponds to each result in the `agg_blocks` list. 

4. There's a complex conditional flow to handle exceptional cases which makes the code difficult to understand and maintain.

A possible strategy for fixing the bug is to simplify the logic in `_cython_agg_blocks` and explicitly keep track of the aggregation results for each block in a more structured way. Another approach could be to introduce clear logging and comments to explain the complex logic.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)
    
    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    for block in data.blocks:
        try:
            block_result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(block_result))
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:  # apply the alternative function
                obj = self.obj[data.items[block.mgr_locs.as_array]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                agg_blocks.append(Block(items=data.items[block.mgr_locs], data=result._data))

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

In this corrected version, the simplified logic processes each block individually and records the resulting blocks in the `agg_blocks` list. Also, unnecessary variables and complexity have been removed.

This corrected version should address the issues previously identified in the buggy function.
