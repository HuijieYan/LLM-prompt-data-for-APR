The root cause of the error is that the `astype` method is being used to cast float values to int values, which is not possible when using the 'safe' casting mode. This generates a `TypeError` indicating that it is not possible to safely cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.

The bug stems from the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the `DataFrameGroupBy` class of the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file. This function is responsible for aggregating groups of data, and it attempts to cast float data to int data using the `astype` method, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, a strategy could involve checking the data types before performing the cast and ensuring that non-equivalent data types are not passed to the `astype` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Omitted for brevity
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Omitted for brevity
        except TypeError:
            # Omitted for brevity
        else:
            # Omitted for brevity
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)
            # Omitted for brevity
        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype.kind == 'f':  # Check if the block's dtype is float
                result_dtype = np.result_type(result)
                result = maybe_convert_objects(result, convert_dates=False)
                try:
                    result = maybe_convert_downcast(result, dtype=result_dtype)
                except ValueError:
                    pass  # Don't cast if it would result in data loss
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, a check has been added to ensure that the casting is only attempted on float-based dtype blocks (`block.dtype.kind == 'f'`). If the dtype is float, the casting is done using the `maybe_convert_downcast` function, which automatically downcasts while protecting against data loss.

This approach addresses the bug, preventing the TypeError from occurring when casting invalid data types.

By using this corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved, allowing `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions to be called on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with nullable integer dtype values.
