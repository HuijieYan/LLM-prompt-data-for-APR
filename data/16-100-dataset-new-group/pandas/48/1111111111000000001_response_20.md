The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the DataFrameGroupBy class currently has a bug due to an IndexError that occurs during the indexing of the output DataFrame. This is causing the failing test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` to fail because the expected DataFrame does not match the result of the function.

To fix this bug, the indexing of the output DataFrame should be adjusted to address the IndexError that is currently occurring. The fucntion should be debugged to handle this situation appropriately and return the correct output DataFrame.

Here's a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that should pass the failing test:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    
    # ... (previous code remains the same, omitted for brevity)
    
    if deleted_items:
        # then adjust deleted items according to the items that have been removed
        for deleted in deleted_items:
            indexer = np.delete(indexer, deleted)
    
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        locs = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + locs)]
        offset += locs

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the updated indexing of `indexer` and offset, the corrected function should be able to handle the IndexError and should pass the failing test.
