Based on the error message and the GitHub issue, it seems that the problem is related to casting the values during aggregation when using the new nullable integer data type. The current error occurs when trying to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64 using the `safe_cast` function. This issue occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, and `var` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with `Int64` dtype. The `TypeError` is raised when trying to cast float64 to int64, which is not possible according to the casting rule 'safe'.

The problem can be resolved by handling the casting differently based on the data type, specifically for nullable integers. A strategy for fixing the bug would be to modify the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer data types specifically, ensuring that the casting is performed according to the rules for safe casting from float64 to int64.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code ...
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # existing code ...

            result = maybe_convert_objects(result, store=block)
            
            if is_nullable_integer_dtype(result.dtype):
                result = maybe_downcast_to_dtype(result, np.dtype('int64'))
                casted = result.astype(np.dtype('int64'), copy=False)
                if (casted == result).all():
                    result = casted
                else:
                    raise TypeError(
                        f"cannot safely cast non-equivalent {result.dtype} to {np.dtype('int64')}"
                    )
            agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))

        # existing code ...

    # existing code ...

```

In the corrected version, we have added specific handling for nullable integer data types. We use the `maybe_convert_objects` function to ensure objects are converted appropriately. Then, for nullable integer data types, we use the `maybe_downcast_to_dtype` function to attempt conversion to int64, and then check if the casting was successful. If successful, the result is appended to the `agg_blocks`. If not, a `TypeError` is raised, indicating that the casting from float64 to int64 is not possible.

This corrected version should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
