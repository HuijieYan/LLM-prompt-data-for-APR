**Analyzing the buggy function**

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` is used for aggregating blocks of data and the error message is a `TypeError` related to a failed cast operation.

**Identifying potential error locations within the buggy function**

The error message states that the function failed to perform a safe cast from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')` according to the rule 'safe'.

**Explaining the cause of the bug**

The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to cast a float array to an integer array. This is likely happening when dealing with non-numeric data during aggregation, as non-numeric functions are caught by the `except NotImplementedError` block and a cast is attempted.

**Suggesting a strategy for fixing the bug**

One way to fix the bug is to enforce that the safe casting should only be applied to numeric types and exclude non-numeric data blocks from the safe casting process.

**Providing the corrected version of the function**

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    # if numeric_only is True, get numeric data else get all data 
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include="number", copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        values = block.values

        # Skip non-numeric blocks from casting and aggregation
        if not np.issubdtype(values.dtype, np.number):
            # Exclude from aggregation
            continue

        if how in ["mean", "var", "median", "any_other_numeric_function"]:  # Include all numeric operations
            # Perform the aggregation for numeric blocks
            result = values.aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:
            # Exclude non-applicable functions
            # and try to perform the operation in an alternate way
            assert alt is not None
            data_items = data.items[locs]
            if len(data_items) > 1:
                # Multiple items are not supported for non-applicable functions if alt is provided
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data_items[0]]  # Get the single object
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            # Unwrap DataFrame to get array
            if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
                result = result.iloc[:, 0]

        # Append the computed aggregated value to the list of aggregation blocks
        agg_blocks.append(block.make_block(result))
        # Append the corresponding locations to the list of agg_items
        agg_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(agg_items))
```

This corrected version will only perform the aggregation and casting when the datatype is numeric. Non-numeric blocks are excluded from aggregation and casting, thereby avoiding the failed safe cast operation from float64 to int64.
