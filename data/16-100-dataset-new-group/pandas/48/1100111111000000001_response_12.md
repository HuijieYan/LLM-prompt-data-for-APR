It seems like the issue occurs within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function in the pandas library. The bug causes the function to fail the `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` test. The test fails because the function's logic is flawed and doesn't return the expected output.

The strategy for fixing the bug involves modifying the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure that it processes the data correctly and returns the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
from pandas.core.internals import items_overlap

def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert(numeric=True, copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    agg_items = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        result = block.aggregate(how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

        if result is None:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj.take(locs, axis=self.axis)
                result = alt(obj, axis=1)

                if not isinstance(result, Block):
                    raise DataError("_cython_agg_blocks result is not a block")

                result = block.make_block(result.values)

        if result is not None:
            new_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_items.append(block.items)
            agg_blocks.append(new_block)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version addresses the potential logical flaws in the original function and should pass the failing test.
