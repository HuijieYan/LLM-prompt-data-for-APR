To address the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, we can make the following adjustments:

The `_cython_agg_blocks` method is meant to aggregate data within a DataFrameGroupBy object. However, the bug is causing an incorrect result when performing this operation, leading to a TypeError when calling mean, median, or std.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the variables, it seems that the issue is related to mishandling of the nullable integer data type (Int64) when performing aggregation within the DataFrameGroupBy object.

To fix the bug:
1. Check the `grouper.aggregate` method to ensure that it correctly handles the nullable integer data type.
2. Consider converting the nullable integer data type to a standard int64 type before performing further operations, as the bug seems to stem from the mishandling of this data type.
3. Verify that the agg_blocks and agg_items are correctly constructed after the aggregation, and the indexes are properly adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` method:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Get the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Ensure that nullable integer data is converted to a standard int64 type
    if data.blocks and isinstance(data.blocks[0], ExtensionBlock) and pd.api.types.is_nullable_integer_dtype(data.blocks[0].dtype):
        data = data.convert_blocks(maybe_convert_objects)

    # Perform aggregation
    result = self.grouper.aggregate(data.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)

    agg_blocks = []
    new_items = []

    for idx, (labels, func, data_items, locs) in enumerate(result):
        if isinstance(data.items, pd.MultiIndex):
            labels = self._concat_index_labels(alist, axis=1)
        if len(labels) > 0:
            idx = self.obj._galley_helper(
                result, group_axes, key="values", is_numeric=True, columns=labels
            )
            new_items.append(labels) 

        agg_blocks.append(make_block(idx.dtypes).make_block(
            [func(data.get_one_group(name)) for name in labels], new_items, fastpath=True
        ))

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version should address the TypeError issue related to calling mean, median, or std on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype. After applying this fix, running the failing tests associated with this bug should result in successful execution without any TypeErrors.
