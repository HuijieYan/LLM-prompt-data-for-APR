The `DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` function seems to have a bug that could lead to incorrect results. The main issue is with the attempt to aggregate numeric data, particularly when dealing with split object-dtype blocks. The bug causes the function to fail because the numeric-only check is not correctly performed, leading to potential data errors.

The strategy for fixing the bug is to rewrite the logic for the numeric-only check and handling of split object-dtype blocks. Additionally, there should be improved error handling to handle situations where the expected numeric types for aggregation are not present.

Here is the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=np.number)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for locs, block in data.iteritems():
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=0, min_count=min_count
            )
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        except DataError:
            deleted_items.append(locs)
            continue

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(indexer)

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        indexer = indexer[~np.isin(indexer, deleted)]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The revised function uses `select_dtypes` to explicitly select numeric data for aggregation. It also simplifies the aggregation logic and improves error handling for non-numeric blocks. Additionally, it updates the block indexing and improves the handling of deleted items for a cleaner implementation.
