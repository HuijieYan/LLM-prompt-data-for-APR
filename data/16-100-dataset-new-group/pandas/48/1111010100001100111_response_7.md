The bug is likely caused by a TypeError when calling the `mean` function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype. The issue seems to occur when using nullable integer data types and calling certain aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std` after grouping.

The provided function `_cython_agg_blocks` is likely related to the issue, as it handles aggregation within the DataFrameGroupBy.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types properly within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

Here is a corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that aims to address the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        result = block._try_aggregate(how, alt, axis=1, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only)
        if result is not None:
            agg_blocks.append(result)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Update the agg_items
    agg_items = data.items
    for block in agg_blocks:
        agg_items = agg_items.insert(len(agg_items), block.mgr_locs)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this corrected version, the function iterates over the blocks within the data and attempts to aggregate them using the `_try_aggregate` method, which handles the specific logic for nullable integer data types. If a result is obtained, it is appended to the list of `agg_blocks`.

This approach aims to properly handle the aggregation of nullable integer data types when calling the `_cython_agg_blocks` function within the DataFrameGroupBy.

Please note that this is a proposed fix that relies on assumptions about the internals of the DataFrameGroupBy and the behavior of the data. It may require further testing and adjustments based on the actual behavior of the method and the data.
