To fix the bug, we need to update the `agg_block` variable when the `how` argument is set to `'var'`. The issue that needs to be addressed is that the aggregated result is being hard-coded to `0.5`, which is incorrect. Instead, we should calculate the variance and update the `agg_block` variable with the correct result.

Here is the corrected version of the function with the bug fix:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.internals import Block
from pandas.core.indexes.base import Index

def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # code before the fix remains the same

    for block in data.blocks:
        # code before the fix remains the same

        if how == 'var':
            # calculate the variance of the block values
            result = np.square(block.values - block.values.mean()).sum() / (block.values.count() - 1)

            # create a new Block using the variance result
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(np.array([[result]]))

            # append the agg_block to agg_blocks
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            # code before the fix remains the same
```

In this modification, we addressed the bug related to the 'var' aggregation method. When 'var' is the value of the `how` parameter, a new `agg_block` with the calculated variance is appended to `agg_blocks`.

By making this change, we ensure that the function now produces correct aggregate results for the 'var' method.

Hopefully, the corrected function now resolves the bug associated with using the 'var' aggregation method. This should lead to the expected output for the various test cases previously provided.
