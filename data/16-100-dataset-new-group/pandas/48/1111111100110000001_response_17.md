## The problematic code
The error comes from the attempt to cast a float64 to int64 using `values.astype(dtype, casting="safe", copy=copy)`. The error might occur because the values are of float64 type and cannot be safely cast to int64 as requested.

## Potential location of error
The error may be located in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, particularly the block elements with dtype float64.

## Explanation
The error message indicates that there was a failed attempt to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64 according to the rule `safe`. This likely happened during the aggregation process when performing the operation of casting float64 to int64.

## Strategy to fix the bug
1. We can validate whether the input data contains float64 elements and handle them differently than the `Int64` (nullable integer) type. If floating-point operations are required, the numeric data can be converted to float type instead of forcing a cast to int type.

2. We can modify the function to detect and handle float64 differently, or convert the input data to a compatible type before applying the aggregation operation.

3. By implementing checks to properly handle float64 data, it should be possible to avoid the error.

## The corrected version
```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Handles safe conversion from float64
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # code for handling float64 and int64 separately
        if block.values.dtype == np.float64:
            result = block.values  # convert to float type
        else:
            try:
                result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                    block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
                )
            except NotImplementedError:
                if alt is None:
                    assert how == "ohlc"
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue

        # the rest of the code...
    # rest of the code...
```
In the corrected version, the code has been modified to handle float64 and int64 differently during the aggregation process. The change should allow for safe handling of the data without causing the TypeError when attempting to cast non-equivalent float64 to int64.
