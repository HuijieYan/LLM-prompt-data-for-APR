The bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is likely causing the test `test_apply_to_nullable_integer_returns_float` to fail. The function is encountering a TypeError when performing calculations on a DataFrame containing nullable integer (Int64) data types. The issue on GitHub provides an example similar to the failing test, and the expected result is not being met when the `mean` function is applied to the grouped data.

The function is intended to aggregate data for grouped DataFrames but is failing for nullable integer data types. 

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function is handling the nullable integer data when attempting to calculate the mean, median, or variance. Based on the failing test cases and the GitHub issue, the function needs to be modified to handle these nullable integer data types appropriately.

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` should be updated to handle nullable integer (Int64) data types when performing aggregation calculations to ensure it can handle mean, median, and variance correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Add handling for nullable integer data types
    if data._is_integer_na_type:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

This modification converts the DataFrame to the nullable integer data type to handle the calculations for mean, median, and variance correctly.
