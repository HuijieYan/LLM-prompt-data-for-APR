### Strategy for fixing the bug:
- The issue appears to be related to calling the `mean` function on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object with columns of type `Int64`.
- From the description, the error occurs when calling `mean`, `median`, and `std`, but not when calling `min`, `max`, or `first`.
- Given that the error occurs with specific aggregation functions, it's likely a problem with the way the grouped data is handled in these specific cases.
- The error message seems to be a `TypeError`, which could indicate a problem with type conversion or handling of nullable integer data.
- Investigate the code related to the calculation of these aggregation functions within the `DataFrameGroupBy` class to identify any issues with handling nullable integers.

### Corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the _cython_agg_blocks function
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # code related to managing of mgr_locs is omitted for brevity
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()
    
    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        values = block.values
        # Handle only the integer-type blocks with nullable values
        if isinstance(values, pd.arrays.IntegerArray):
            result = values._reduce(how, skipna=False, min_count=min_count)
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            # For non-integer-type blocks, continue the aggregation process as before
            # (code for the existing non-integer block types)
            ...
    
    # Rest of the logic to handle deleted items, split items, indexing, etc.

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version, we explicitly check for `pd.arrays.IntegerArray` and handle the aggregation differently for these blocks, ensuring that the nullable integer data type is correctly handled when calculating aggregation functions like `mean`, `median`, and `std`.

This corrected approach should address the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report related to the handling of nullable integers during aggregation operations.
