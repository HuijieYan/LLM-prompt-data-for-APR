The bug in the `_engine` function is likely due to the weak reference `period` not being used properly to create an instance of the `_engine_type`. This incorrect use of the weak reference is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute of the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix the bug, the correct usage of weak references should be implemented for creating the `_engine_type` instance with the `period` reference.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Properly use weak reference to create an instance of _engine_type
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By updating the `_engine` function to use `period()` instead of `period` when creating the `_engine_type` instance, we ensure that the weak reference is being properly used to access the underlying object.

With this corrected version, the failing test should pass and the expected input/output values should be satisfied.
