The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the weak reference not being properly passed to the `_engine_type` method, resulting in a NoneType object being returned and causing an AttributeError later in the code. This is consistent with the error message indicating that a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'.

To fix the bug, the weak reference should be correctly passed to the `_engine_type` method to ensure that it receives a valid reference to the PeriodIndex object.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference `self` is properly invoked by adding `()` after `period` to pass the actual reference to the `_engine_type` method instead of the weakref object.

This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report and allow the failing test to pass.
