The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing the `NoneType` error in the failing test. The weak reference to `self` is not being maintained, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly maintained and used to create the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    period_index_length = len(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, period_index_length)
```

The change ensures that the weak reference `period_weakref` retains a reference to `self` throughout the function's execution, preventing it from being dropped prematurely. This should resolve the `NoneType` error in the failing test and properly initialize the `PeriodEngine` with the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex`.

With this change, the corrected version of the function should resolve the GitHub issue and pass the failing test.
