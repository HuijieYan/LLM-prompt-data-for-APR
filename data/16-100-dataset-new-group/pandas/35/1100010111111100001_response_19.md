The problem with the `_engine` function is that it returns `None` instead of the expected period engine. This is causing the error in the failing test.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference `period` is not being properly passed to `_engine_type`, resulting in `None` being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference `period` is correctly passed to `_engine_type` so that it can create the period engine.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` when passing it to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference is properly resolved and the period engine is created.

With this change, the function should now return the period engine as expected and pass the failing test.
