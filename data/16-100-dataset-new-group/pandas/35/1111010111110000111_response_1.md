The potential error in the provided buggy function is that the `_engine` function is returning `self._engine_type(period, len(self))` but the `period` is a weak reference, and it is not handled properly by the `_engine_type` function, resulting in a reference cycle.

The cause of the bug is that the `PeriodEngine` is not handling weak references properly, and it is resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute from a `NoneType` object due to the weak reference being dropped.

To fix the bug, the `weakref` should be handled properly to avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the object is not deleted prematurely.

Based on the analysis, here is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to the `self` object is created using `weakref.proxy`, which ensures that the object referenced by `period_ref` is not prematurely deleted, thus addressing the issue of losing weakrefs.

This corrected version should resolve the bug and pass the failing test as well as resolve the GitHub issue.
