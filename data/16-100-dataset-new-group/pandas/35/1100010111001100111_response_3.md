## Correction

The issue is caused by the weak reference to `self` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained and used in the `_engine` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` method:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By passing `period()` instead of just `period` to `_engine_type`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` is still valid when used in the `_engine` method.

With this correction, the failing test case should now pass and the issue described on GitHub should be resolved.
