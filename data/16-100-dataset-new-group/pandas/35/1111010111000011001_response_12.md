### Analysis
The provided buggy function is a cached property that returns an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to the `self` object. The `_engine_type` is defined elsewhere in the class and it seems to be dependent on the `PeriodIndex` object.

### Bug
The bug in the function appears to be with the usage of `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to `self`. This may not be the correct approach to pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type` object.

### Fix Strategy
To fix the bug, we need to find a suitable way to pass a weak reference to the `_engine_type` object. We should reconsider the use of `weakref.ref` and ensure that the weak reference is correctly passed to `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version of the function
```python
from weakref import WeakMethod

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self instance method
    weak_self = WeakMethod(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we use `WeakMethod` to create a weak reference to the `self` object and then pass it to the `_engine_type` object. This should resolve the weak reference issue and fix the bug.
