### Fixing the Bug
The issue occurs because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix this bug, the weak reference needs to be handled correctly within the `_engine` function.

## The corrected version of the function
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

## Explanation
In the original `_engine` function, the weak reference to `self` was not being called properly to get the referenced object. By modifying `period` to `period()`, the weak reference is dereferenced correctly, ensuring that the `PeriodIndex` is passed to the `PeriodEngine` as intended. This modification resolves the issue described in the GitHub post and ensures that the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test passes as expected.

The corrected version of the function ensures that the weak reference is properly dereferenced before being passed to the `_engine_type`, resolving the issue and allowing the test to pass.
