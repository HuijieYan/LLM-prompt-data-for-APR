The bug in the `_engine` function is causing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` when the failing test case is executed.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning the result from `self._engine_type` without proper validation or handling of the weak reference created for `period`.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that it produces a valid result.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference `period` is immediately invoked with `()` to obtain the referenced object. This ensures that the weak reference is valid and can be used to create the engine.

With this fix, the `_engine` function should handle the weak reference properly and return a valid engine, resolving the `AttributeError` issue.
