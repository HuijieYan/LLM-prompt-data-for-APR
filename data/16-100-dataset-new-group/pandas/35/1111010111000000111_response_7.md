The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is using the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` object, but it's not being used correctly which causes the reference to be lost and the engine to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object. This results in the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.

The issue reported on GitHub describes the problem as the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it's no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference in an instance variable to prevent it from being garbage collected while the `_engine` function is in use.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_weakref'):
        # Store the weak reference to self in _period_weakref
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is stored in the instance variable `_period_weakref`, ensuring that it remains valid until the `_engine` function is finished with it.

This corrected version of the function should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test.
