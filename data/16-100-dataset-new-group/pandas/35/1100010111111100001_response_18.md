The bug in the `_engine` function is likely causing an AttributeError when accessing the `view` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

The `_engine` function uses weakref to avoid a reference cycle and then returns a call to `self._engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self`. However, the bug could be occurring in the `self._engine_type` call, where it appears that the returned value is `None`, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the `view` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to handle the case where `self._engine_type` returns `None`. In this case, it should return an appropriate value instead of directly accessing attributes that may not exist.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine is not None:
        return engine
    else:
        # Replace with appropriate return value when engine is None
        return NotImplemented  # Or any other suitable default return value
```

By checking for the `None` return value and handling it appropriately, the corrected version of the `_engine` function should now pass the failing test.
