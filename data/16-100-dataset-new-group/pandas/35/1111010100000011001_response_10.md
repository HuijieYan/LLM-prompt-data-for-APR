#### Explanation
The `_engine` function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which indicates that it is trying to cache the return value of the function. The function is using a weak reference to the `self` parameter to avoid a reference cycle.

#### Bug
The bug in the function is that it is not correctly creating a weak reference to the `self` parameter. The `weakref.ref` function is not used correctly, which may lead to a memory leak or other unexpected behavior.

#### Fix
We should use the `weakref` module to create a weak reference to the `self` parameter. Then, the `_engine` function should return the `_engine_type` using the weak reference.

#### The corrected code
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
