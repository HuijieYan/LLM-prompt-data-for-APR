# The buggy function has a decorator `@cache_readonly` which indicates that it is intended to be a cached, read-only property.

# Potential error locations within the buggy function:
1. It's possible that the weak reference `period = weakref.ref(self)` is not being used correctly when passed to `_engine_type`.
2. There could be an issue with the usage of `self._engine_type`.

# The cause of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to weak referencing of the PeriodIndex. When the PeriodIndex is weakly referenced, it may get dropped before it is intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

# Strategy for fixing the bug:
The `weakref.ref` should be used correctly to avoid the reference cycle. Additionally, the implementation of `_engine_type` should be revisited to ensure it correctly handles weak references.

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```
In this updated version, the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type` only if `_engine_type` is truthy, otherwise it returns None.

This change ensures proper handling of weak referencing and eliminates the possibility of a reference cycle issue.
