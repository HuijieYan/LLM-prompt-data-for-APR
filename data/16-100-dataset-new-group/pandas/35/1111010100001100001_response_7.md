The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is preventing the proper creation of the engine type for the `PeriodIndex` class.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the incorrect use of `weakref.ref` and directly pass `self` to the `_engine_type` class.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By making this change, the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object will be passed to the `_engine_type` class, allowing it to create the engine type properly.
