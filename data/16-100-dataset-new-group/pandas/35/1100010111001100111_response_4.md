To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely before it's intended. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that it is still valid when passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` in `period_weakref`, we ensure that it remains valid until it is passed to `_engine_type`.

With this fix, the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should now pass, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
