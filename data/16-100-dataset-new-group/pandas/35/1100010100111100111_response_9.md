The buggy function `_engine` returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`, but it seems that the `self._engine_type` method is not correctly handling the weak reference to `self` passed as an argument. This is causing an AttributeError when the engine tries to access the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is correctly handled by `_engine_type`, so that it can access the `PeriodIndex` object without raising an AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine if engine is not None else self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we first attempt to create the engine using the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object. If the engine is `None`, we fallback to creating the engine using the original `self` reference.

By adding this fallback mechanism, we ensure that the engine is always created with a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

This should resolve the AttributeError and ensure that the failing test passes.
