The bug in the provided function is that the weak reference `period` is being used incorrectly, leading to a None value being passed to the `_engine_type` method, which causes the error mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly create the weak reference using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`. This will ensure that the weak reference `period` does not get garbage collected before it is intended to.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By making this change, we can resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem description, and the function will work as intended.
