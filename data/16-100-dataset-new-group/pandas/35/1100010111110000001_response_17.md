The buggy function is the `_engine` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file. The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` in the `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` file is encountering an AttributeError due to the `_engine` function.

The potential error location in the `_engine` function is during the creation of a weak reference to `self` (`period = weakref.ref(self)`). This weak reference must be checked to ensure it is not causing a reference cycle or returning a `NoneType` object.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created from `self` might be returning a `NoneType` object, resulting in the AttributeError seen in the failing test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` does not return a `NoneType` object, and if it does, handle it appropriately to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    if period() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to 'self' is None.")
```

In the corrected version, we first check if the weak reference `period` is not returning a `NoneType` object using `if period() is not None:`. If the weak reference is not `None`, we proceed to return the `_engine_type` with the weak reference and `len(self)`. If the weak reference is `None`, we raise a `ValueError` to handle the situation.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and pass the failing test.
