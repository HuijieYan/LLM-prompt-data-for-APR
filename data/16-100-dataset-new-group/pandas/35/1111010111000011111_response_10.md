The cause of the bug is related to the `_engine` function in the `PeriodIndex` class, where the weak reference to `self` is not being properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly and not dropped prematurely.

Below is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# Correction to the _engine function
@property
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))
```

By using `@property` decorator, we can turn the `_engine` function into a property, which will ensure that it gets evaluated every time it's called. Then, by using `weakref.ref(self)`, we can ensure that a weak reference to `self` is properly maintained and not dropped prematurely.

This corrected version of the `_engine` function should resolve the issue and pass the failing test case while maintaining the expected input/output values outlined in the GitHub issue.
