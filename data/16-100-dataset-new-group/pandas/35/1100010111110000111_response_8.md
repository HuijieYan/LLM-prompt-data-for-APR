1. Analysis:
   - The buggy function `_engine` is decorated with `@cache_readonly`, indicating that it is meant to be memoized and only calculated once.
   - The failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` tries to use the `assert` statement to check if all the values in `idx2.levels` are monotonic.
   - The error message points to an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicating that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

2. Potential error location:
   - The issue may be in the creation or referencing of the `PeriodEngine`.

3. Cause of the bug:
   - The `_engine` function is supposed to return the `PeriodEngine` for the `PeriodIndex`, but due to an error, it returns a `NoneType` instead. This causes the error when trying to access the `view` attribute of the `NoneType`.

4. Fixing strategy:
   - Ensure that the `weakref` is properly passed to the `_engine_type` and that the weak reference to `period` is maintained throughout the function execution.

5. Corrected version:
```python
# Corrected version of _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a weak reference to self to avoid reference cycle
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the `weak_period` is created as a weak reference to `self`, and this weak reference is passed to the `_engine_type` to avoid the reference cycle issue.
