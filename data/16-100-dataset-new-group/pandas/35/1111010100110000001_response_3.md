The buggy function `_engine` is a method within the `PeriodIndex` class. The `@cache_readonly` decorator indicates that the result of the method should be cached and reused. The purpose of this method is to return the engine type that is used for internal storage and manipulation of the index.

The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `PeriodEngine` class, specifically with an attribute, `vgetter()`, which is returning a `NoneType` object and causing an `AttributeError` when `view("i8")` is called on it.

From the error message and the provided function, it seems that the `_engine_type` is expected to be the class responsible for providing the engine to the `PeriodIndex`. However, it appears that the weak reference is not properly being handled, leading to the `NoneType` issue.

To fix this bug, the weak reference handling needs to be reviewed and potentially refactored.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    if not hasattr(self, '_period_ref') or self._period_ref() is None:
        self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

The correction involves checking if the weak reference has already been stored for the `PeriodIndex`. If not, then a new weak reference is created and stored in the `self._period_ref` attribute. This ensures that the weak reference exists and is not garbage collected prematurely, leading to the `NoneType` issue.

This corrected version ensures that the weak reference is handled properly, and that the `_engine_type` is called with the proper reference to the `PeriodIndex`.
