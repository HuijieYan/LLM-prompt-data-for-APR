The buggy function `_engine` in the `PeriodIndex` class is designed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` associated with the `PeriodIndex`. The declared `cache_readonly` decorator suggests that the `_engine` function is expected to compute some result based on its input arguments and cache the result for future use.

The cause of the bug is related to the `weakref` utility used within the `_engine` function. The line `period = weakref.ref(self)` constructs a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance `self` before instantiating the `_engine_type` object. The weak reference object `period` is expected to allow `self` to be garbage collected when it's no longer in use, eliminating any potential reference cycles. However, the weak reference is not being utilized correctly, and it's resulting in a `NoneType` error when trying to access attributes or methods of the weak reference object.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the weak reference is being used appropriately and that the resulting `_engine` object is properly instantiated with the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    if getattr(self, '_period_weakref', None) is None:
        # To avoid a reference cycle, use the weakref.ref type directly
        self._period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_weakref, len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the `weakref.ref` object is stored as an attribute on the `PeriodIndex` instance to prevent it from being garbage collected. Then, it's used to instantiate the `_engine_type` object with the weak reference to `self` and the length of the index. This corrected implementation should prevent the `NoneType` error when accessing attributes or methods of the weak reference object.
