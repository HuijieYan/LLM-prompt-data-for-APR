The buggy function `_engine` is using the `weakref.ref` function to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. However, it is not being used correctly, leading to the weak reference being dropped before it should.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being maintained properly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the usage of the `weakref.ref` function and ensure that the weak reference is maintained as long as it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self using weakref.ref
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    
    def period_wrapper():
        return self
    
    # Pass the weak reference to a wrapper function to avoid the reference cycle
    return self._engine_type(period_wrapper, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, we create a `period_wrapper` function that returns `self`. This function serves as a way to access `self` through the weak reference without creating a reference cycle. Then, we pass the weak reference and the length of `self` to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This ensures that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until it is no longer needed.
