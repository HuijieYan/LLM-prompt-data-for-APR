The issue with the buggy function `_engine` is that it's using `weakref.ref` incorrectly, which is causing the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to fail.

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of `weakref.ref` on `self`, which is resulting in the `_engine` method returning an incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we should use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the `_engine` function should now correctly return the expected result, and the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` should pass.
