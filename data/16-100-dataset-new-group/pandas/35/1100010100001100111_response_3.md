The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` to avoid a reference cycle. However, the bug seems to be related to the weak reference being dropped before it's intended.

The potential error location is likely within the weakref usage or the handling of the weak reference in the `_engine_type` function.

The bug causes the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before it's intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference handling or the way it's passed to `_engine_type` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the weak reference to `PeriodIndex` is maintained until its intended usage.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    result = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return result
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is created and passed to `_engine_type`, and its result is stored in a variable before being returned. This ensures that the weak reference isn't dropped prematurely and is used as intended by `_engine_type`.
