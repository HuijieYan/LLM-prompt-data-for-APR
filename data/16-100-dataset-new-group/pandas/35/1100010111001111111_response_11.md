Based on the provided information, here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

The bug in the original function was caused by not calling the weakref object 'period' as a function. By adding parentheses '()' after 'period', we ensure that we are actually dereferencing the weak reference and passing the referenced object to 'self._engine_type'.

This change should resolve the issue and the failing test case as described in the GitHub issue.
