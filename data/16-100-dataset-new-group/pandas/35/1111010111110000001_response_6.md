The error occurs in the `PeriodEngine` class which is part of the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx` file. More specifically, it's trying to access an attribute called `view` on an object that is a `NoneType`, which results in the `AttributeError`. 

The source of the error is in the `PeriodIndex` class within the `pandas/core/indexes/period.py` file, particularly in the `_engine` method. The `@cache_readonly` decorator indicates that the method's output should be cached after the first use. The method appears to aim at returning an instance of `engine_type` with `period` and `len(self)` passed as arguments.

The issue occurs due to the `weakref.ref(self)` line. It seems that the intent of this line is to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance in order to avoid a reference cycle, but the resulting weak reference `period` should be invoked with an argument (namely, `self`). The weak reference itself should not be returned, and it seems like the `engine_type` method should be invoked in a different way.

A strategy for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that `self` is wrapped in the weak reference, and the actual object is retrieved from the weak reference before invoking the `engine_type`.
2. Make sure that the methods and objects used within the `_engine` method are accessible and correctly initialized.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_obj = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_obj, len(self))
```
This corrected version should eliminate the `NoneType` error and resolve the issue.
