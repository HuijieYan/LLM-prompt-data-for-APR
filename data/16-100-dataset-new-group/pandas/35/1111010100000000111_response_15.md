The bug in the function `_engine` is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a None instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should be modified to correctly handle the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` and avoid dropping it prematurely.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This corrected version ensures that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is maintained throughout the execution of the `_engine` function, preventing it from being dropped prematurely and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
