The buggy function is the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. It is using the `@cache_readonly` decorator, which should create a cached version of the function so that it is only calculated once and then reused on subsequent calls. 

The potential error location is in the `weakref.ref(self)` usage. The `weakref.ref` function creates a weak reference to the object, but it needs to be dereferenced to access the original object. In this case, since the weak reference is not being dereferenced, it can lead to potential errors when the `_engine` function is called, as it may not be using the original `self` object as intended.

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference created by `weakref.ref(self)` is not being properly dereferenced, leading to potential errors when the `_engine` function is called.

To fix the bug, the weak reference needs to be dereferenced to access the original object. This can be done by using the `()` operator to call the weak reference and obtain the original object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
By adding `()` at the end of `weakref.ref(self)`, it dereferences the weak reference and returns the original `self` object, fixing the potential bug.
