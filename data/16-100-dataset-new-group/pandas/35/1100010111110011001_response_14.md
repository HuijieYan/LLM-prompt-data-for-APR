The buggy function `_engine` seems to be using the `cache_readonly` decorator, which is likely causing the issue. The error message indicates an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, suggesting that the `PeriodEngine` is not being properly initialized within the `_engine` function.

To fix the bug, the `cache_readonly` decorator should be removed from the `_engine` function, and instead, the function should explicitly handle caching. This should ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is properly initialized when `_engine` is called.

Here is a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_engine'):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        self._engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return self._engine
```

This corrected version should address the caching issue and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` is properly initialized.
