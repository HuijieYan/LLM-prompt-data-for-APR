### Analysis:
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref(self)` to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance, but it seems that the weak reference is being dropped prematurely, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This behavior is causing the issue described in the GitHub problem, where copying `PeriodIndex` levels on `MultiIndex` loses weakrefs.

### Potential error locations:
1. Premature dropping of weak reference in the `_engine` function.
2. Incorrect handling of weak references in the `PeriodEngine`.

### Cause of the bug:
The weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance is not being maintained properly, leading to it being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Strategy for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be maintained properly throughout the `_engine` function to ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. This can be achieved by ensuring that the weak reference is used correctly and not garbage collected prematurely.

### Corrected Version:
```python
# The buggy function is fixed by maintaining the weak reference correctly
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
