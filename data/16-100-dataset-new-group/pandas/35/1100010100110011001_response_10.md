### Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` has a decorator `@cache_readonly` which suggests that the function is meant to be cached and only computed once. However, the error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' related to `NoneType`, which suggests that the `_engine` is returning `None` instead of the expected type.

Upon further inspection, it seems that the weak reference `period` is being used incorrectly and the `_engine_type` might not be returning the expected value.

### Bug
The bug is caused by the function returning `None` instead of the expected type. This is likely due to an issue with how the weak reference `period` is being used.

### Fix
To fix the bug, we can use the weak reference `period()` method to get the referenced object (in this case, `self`) and then call the `_engine_type` method on it.

### The corrected version
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```
