The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before it should be, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This is leading to the failing test and the GitHub issue raised.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained for as long as it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference of self
    period = weakref.ref(self)

    # Create a new weak reference to the period engine type
    engine_type = weakref.ref(self._engine_type)

    # Check if both references are still live
    if period() is not None and engine_type() is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise ValueError("Weak references are no longer live")
```

With this correction, the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is retained until it is needed by the `PeriodEngine`, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the failing test passes.
