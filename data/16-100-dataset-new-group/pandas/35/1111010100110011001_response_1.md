The buggy function is attempting to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` constructor. However, the weak reference is not being properly created, leading to an AttributeError when the `vgetter()` method is called on the weak reference.

To fix this, we need to create a proper weak reference to `self` by using `weakref.ref(self)` and then pass it to `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
    @cache_readonly
    def _engine(self):
        # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
        period = weakref.ref(self)
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

With this change, the function should now properly create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to `_engine_type` constructor, resolving the AttributeError in the failing test.
