The bug in the `_engine` function is that it does not correctly create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor. This can cause a reference cycle, leading to potential memory leaks, and it does not correctly capture the intended behavior of using a weak reference.

To fix this bug, we should use `weakref.proxy` to create a weak reference to `self` and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref.proxy of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

With this fix, the `self` object will be correctly weakly referenced, preventing reference cycles and potential memory leaks.

This fix should address the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods`.
