### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using a `cache_readonly` decorator, which means that this function will only be evaluated once and then the result will be cached. The function is creating a weak reference to `self` and then passing that weak reference to `_engine_type`, along with the length of `self`. However, it is unclear what `_engine_type` is or how it uses the weak reference.

### Bug
The bug seems to be related to the usage of the weak reference and how it is passed to `_engine_type`. Since `self` is being weakly referenced, it is possible that the object it references gets garbage collected before `_engine_type` is called, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Strategy for fixing the bug
The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is well-handled, and that `_engine_type` uses the weak reference properly to avoid any potential garbage collection issues. This can be done by storing the weak reference as a separate variable and then using it in `_engine_type`.

### The corrected version
```python
# The relative path of the fixed file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
In this version, we are not caching the result using `cache_readonly` and we are simply creating the weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type`. The `_engine_type` function should handle weak references properly to avoid any potential issues with garbage collection.
