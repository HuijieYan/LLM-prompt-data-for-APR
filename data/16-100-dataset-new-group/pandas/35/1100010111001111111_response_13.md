The issue with the current implementation of the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it to `_engine_type` without properly maintaining the reference. This results in the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This causes the failing test `test_get_level_values_when_periods` to raise an error.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_engine` function to maintain a reference to the weakly referenced `self` throughout the execution of `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a reference to the weakly referenced self throughout the execution of _engine_type
    weak_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period_engine = self._engine_type(weak_ref(), len(self))
    return period_engine
```

By maintaining a reference to the weakly referenced `self` throughout the execution of `_engine_type`, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected, resolving the bug and addressing the GitHub issue.
