The buggy function `_engine()` seems to be method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This function is creating a weak reference of the `self` and returning the result of a method call upon a type associated with the `_engine_type`.

The error message, `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, indicates that there is a attribute error while calling the `view` method on a `NoneType` object. This means that either the `_engine_type` attribute is not properly initialized or is not being set to an appropriate value, leading to incorrect function calls later on.

To fix the bug, we can make sure that the `_engine` method is properly initialized. If it's expected to return a `PeriodEngine` object, we need to check whether the `self._engine_type` method returns the correct type.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    
    # Perform a check to ensure that the engine is of the expected type
    if not isinstance(engine, PeriodEngine):
        raise TypeError("The _engine_type did not return a PeriodEngine object")
    
    return engine
```
