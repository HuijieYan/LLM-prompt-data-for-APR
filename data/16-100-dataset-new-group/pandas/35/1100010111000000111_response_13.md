The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the weak reference to `self` when passing it to `_engine_type`.

The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before it is intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`, which is leading to the failing test case in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the weak reference should be properly handled to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely when passed to `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# this is the corrected function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, the weak reference to `self` is correctly called using `period()` to ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is properly passed to `_engine_type`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the failing test case in the GitHub issue passes.
