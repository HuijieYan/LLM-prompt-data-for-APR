The cause of the bug in the `_engine` function is that the `period` variable is created as a weak reference to `self`, but it is not maintained in the function scope. As a result, when `self` is garbage collected, `period` becomes a weak reference to `None`, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we should store `period` as an instance attribute so that it is maintained as long as the `PeriodIndex` instance is alive. This will ensure that the weak reference does not become a reference to `None` prematurely.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Store period as an instance attribute to maintain the weak reference
    self._period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._period_ref, len(self))
```

By storing `self._period_ref` as an instance attribute, we ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained as long as the instance is alive, preventing premature garbage collection and resolving the bug reported in the GitHub issue.
