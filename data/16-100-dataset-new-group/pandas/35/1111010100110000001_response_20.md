The `PeriodIndex` class contains a function named `_engine` that is used to avoid a reference cycle by passing a weak reference of self to `_engine_type`. However, the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'` error message in the failing test suggests that the return type of the `_engine` function is `None` instead of the expected type (which likely has a `view` attribute).

Looking at the `_engine` function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

The issue is that the `period` variable is defined, but it is not actually used in the return statement. It's likely that the return statement should use `period` to pass the weak reference to `_engine_type`. This is the root cause of the `AttributeError` because the return value is not what is expected.

The `self._engine_type` method seems to be causing the issue. This method should handle the weak reference of `period` gracefully but is currently returning `None`, causing the error.

To fix the bug, we should make sure that the weak reference `period` is correctly used when calling `self._engine_type` and ensure that the `self._engine_type` method returns the expected type.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self), period)
```

By making this change, we can ensure that the weak reference `period` is passed to `_engine_type`, and the returning type should be the expected type rather than `None`. This should fix the AttributeError issue.
