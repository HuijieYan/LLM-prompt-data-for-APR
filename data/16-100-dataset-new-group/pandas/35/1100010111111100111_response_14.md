To fix the bug in the _engine function, we need to ensure that a weak reference to self is properly passed to the _engine_type. The issue is related to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex, resulting in the error.

Here's the corrected version of the _engine function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if period() is not None else None
```

By adding a conditional check to ensure that the reference to self is not None before returning the _engine_type, we can avoid the AttributeError caused by NoneType object being passed to the _engine_type. This correction should resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

This fix addresses the weak reference issue and ensures that the _engine function returns the expected output.
