To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, it's important to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained correctly so that the PeriodEngine does not receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

Here's a corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_copy = period()
    return self._engine_type(period_copy, len(self))
```

In the corrected version, the weak reference to `self` is maintained as `period_copy` so that a reference cycle is avoided, and the PeriodIndex is correctly passed to the PeriodEngine. This fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the PeriodEngine does not receive a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.
