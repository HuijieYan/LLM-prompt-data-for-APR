The buggy function is causing the error message related to an 'AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view''. 

The function `_engine` wraps `self._engine_type` and returns its result. However, in the failing test, we are seeing an error related to `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`, which indicates that `self._engine_type` is evaluated as None, and when trying to access the view attribute, it is invalid.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_engine_type` is correctly assigned and is not None when accessed by the `_engine` function. We can use print statements to verify the result and identify the part of the code that is not working as expected.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type
    if engine_type is None:
        raise ValueError("Engine type is None. Check the _engine_type assignment.")
    return engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By explicitly checking if `self._engine_type` is None, we can prevent it from causing attribute errors when trying to access its attributes or methods. Additionally, we can add an exception message to inform future programmers about the issue. While this check may raise a `ValueError`, it is still better than an unexpected `AttributeError`.

With this change, the corrected version of the `_engine` function will handle the potential NoneType issue and provide better information for debugging.
