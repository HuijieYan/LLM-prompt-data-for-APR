## Analysis
The buggy function `_engine` is using `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self` and then passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the issue is related to weak references being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped before it should, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving None instead of the PeriodIndex.

## Strategy for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to self is maintained until it is no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable within the `_engine` function, and then using that variable in the return statement.

## The Corrected Version
```python
# The corrected version of the function

@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self and pass it to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference to self is maintained within the function, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the expected PeriodIndex.
