To fix the bug in the `_engine` function, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is correctly passed to the `_engine_type` function. The error message indicates that the `_engine` function is returning a NoneType, which causes the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute.

The issue on GitHub also provides a specific test case that is failing, along with the expected output. This gives us a clear indication of what needs to be fixed.

Based on the information provided, the bug seems to be caused by the weak reference to the `self` object being dropped before it should be. This results in the `_engine_type` function receiving a None instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `weakref.ref(self)` is correctly maintained until it is used in the `_engine_type` function. This can be achieved by storing the weak reference in a variable and then passing that variable to the `_engine_type` function.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# corrected version of the _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, store a weakref of self in a variable
    weak_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weak_period, len(self))
```

By storing the weak reference in the `weak_period` variable and then passing that variable to the `_engine_type` function, we ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is used. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and allow the failing test to pass.
