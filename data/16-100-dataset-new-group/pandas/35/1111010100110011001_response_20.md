The buggy function is directly related to the class `PeriodIndex` and the error message is pointing to an AttributeError at the line `return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")`. The expected input values are a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object and the length of the index.

The cause of the bug is that the `_engine` function is returning `None` instead of an instance of `PeriodEngine`. This is leading to the AttributeError when the `is_monotonic_increasing` function is called on `self._engine`.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `_engine` function returns an instance of `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return PeriodEngine(period, len(self))  # Assuming PeriodEngine is the correct engine type
```

By modifying the return statement to create a new `PeriodEngine` instance, the corrected version of the function should now return the expected engine type and resolve the AttributeError.
