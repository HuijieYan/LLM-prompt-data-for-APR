The buggy function `_engine` is using weakref to create a weak reference to itself, but it is not being utilized correctly which is leading to the issue. The weakref should be passed to the `_engine_type` for correct functioning. 

The cause of the bug is that the weak reference to `self` is not being passed correctly to `_engine_type`, which results in the engine receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, the weak reference to `self` should be correctly passed to `_engine_type` to ensure that the engine receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected version, the `period` is passed as a function call `period()` to ensure that it returns the actual referenced object, and this reference is then passed to `_engine_type`.

This correction should resolve the issue posted in GitHub and ensure that the failing test case `test_get_level_values_when_periods` passes successfully.
