### Analysis
The `_engine` function is using weakref to avoid a reference cycle, but the way it's being used is causing a bug. The bug occurs when creating a `MultiIndex` from a `PeriodIndex`. The failing test tries to get the level values from the `PeriodIndex` and then create a new `MultiIndex` from those values. The bug results in an error or incorrect values being returned.

### Bug Cause
The `weakref` is being used incorrectly in the `_engine` function. It's trying to create a reference to `self` using `weakref`, but then passing that reference directly to `_engine_type` without using it correctly.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the `weakref.ref` usage needs to be corrected. Instead of passing the weak reference directly, the function needs to use the weak reference to get the actual object before passing it to `_engine_type`.

### Corrected Function
```python
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    period = period_ref()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```
