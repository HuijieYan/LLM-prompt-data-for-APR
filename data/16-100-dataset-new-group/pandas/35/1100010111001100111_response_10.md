It appears that the bug is caused by the weak reference to self being created incorrectly in the `_engine` function. The weak reference is not being maintained properly, leading to the PeriodEngine receiving a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this, the weak reference should be assigned to the `period` variable instead of weakref.ref(self). Then, the `_engine_type` should be called with `period()` instead of `period`. This will ensure that the weak reference is correctly maintained and used by the PeriodEngine.

Here is the corrected version of the `_engine` function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: pandas/core/indexes/period.py

# Corrected version of the buggy function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this fix, the failing test function should now pass and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
