## Solution

### Analysis
The `_engine` function is designed to return an instance of `_engine_type` using a weak reference to `self`. However, the weak reference is not being correctly established, resulting in the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

### Cause of the bug
The bug is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, resulting in the `_engine_type` receiving `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

### Fix strategy
Adjust the weak reference creation to ensure that it is properly established and maintained throughout the `_engine` function's execution.

### Corrected code
```python
# The corrected _engine function
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)

    # Validate if the weak reference exists
    period = period_ref()
    if period is not None:
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        raise RuntimeError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is lost")
```
In the corrected code, a weak reference to `self` is created and then immediately validated for existence. If the weak reference exists, the `_engine_type` instance is created using the weak reference. If the weak reference is lost, a `RuntimeError` is raised. This ensures that the `_engine_type` always receives a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` instance.
